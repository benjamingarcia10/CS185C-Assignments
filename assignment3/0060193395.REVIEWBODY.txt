7	 wife   have been   mission the last few weeks reviewing recent  popular health  fitness books Our primary interest  life-long general fitness not sports performance  the next muscle beach pose contest ' been working out for years  are  decent shape but its admittedly  struggle  getting harder BFL  not  recent book but   very widely sold("See all  reviews" for other books ' read recently)   debated between ourselves whether  give  3 stars  4  the end  gave  the benefit  the doubt  here' why: the advice  fundamentally sound ' comprehensive (addresses   least some extent the three main aspects- mental diet exercise)   holds the fluff factor   minimum (' only 200 pages) ' not our favorite book but its useful Some people are going  get very good results  the short term  you' looking for  serious body make-over   relatively short period  time you could   lot worse than this book The writing  good much better than BFL for Women Some people will find  very motivating   Negative: Meanwhile most people are going   dissappointed  the results they achieve because the rigour required will  too great They won'  able  fit  into their life for the long haul BFL' "high point technique" does work but not  lot  people will find the dedication  effort worth   Things  had  ignore  give BFL 4 stars:  least one reviewer said Bill Phillips was the Tony Robins  fitness Very apt description The before  after photos are hilarious  aware results achieved involved participants   contest complete with cash awards (See Hunicutt' book for  absolutely wonderful rant  this type  stuff) While Phillips writing style will  very effective for some people the high ego -star---bright persona can    bit much  take Many have commented about being turned off  thepitch for Myoplex  agree that  would have been better  Phillips had left this out But then again you can bet all the testimonial "contestants" were using the stuff during their 12 week makeovers   might have been unethical  not mention Myoplex ( the way  are not anti-meal replacement  has its place)  Bottom line: Good but not suitable for everyone  you' going  need  slog through  little bit   advertising campaign

22	 trying  write this review  wasn' quite sure how many stars  give the book/program   one hand the program worked for    followed    "" 6 small meals  day each including  portion  carbs   portion  protein  went  the gym  lift weights 3 times  week   the other 3 days  did  extremely intense 20 minutes  cardio  The good news  that  did lose weight  got  lot fitter  But when you look  the straight facts  6 meals  day added   ususally 1200-1300 calories for  day   was lifting weights 3 times  week  running about 2 miles the other 3 days ' pretty intense   only makes sense that one would lose weight doing this! problem was that  just couldn' stick     did Body for Life for probably 4-5 months looked great but  was always hungry was tired  working out 6 days  week  was tired  having  plan out  meals far  advance  Plus the "free day" where you don' have  exercise  can eat whatever you wantturned into  complete free for all   looked forward    much that was all  could think about  ' consume about 3000 calories   free day!  the end the program was just too much for   keep    now  walk uphill   treadmill 4 times   some quick weight training for  arms 3 times  week    look nearly  good? Nope  don'  But ' what ' found  can   still keep  sanity  the same timeWill this program work for you? Follow   you will lose weight for sure! And all the better  you can keep   because  sure couldn'

9	Guided resistance machine exercise (leg press smith machine seated chest press etc) should   supplement   training program not the focus These machines  NOT allow your body the 3- range  motion   naturally designed  use Over the long haul you WILL get hurt from overuse injuries specifically  that  your soft tissues   Your brain only know movements not muscles  you train  guided resistance machines you will shut down your nervous system' ability  control the stabilizing mechanisms  your joints  keep your body safe while you move   daily basis This  extremely dangerous for your spinal column  well  Exercise done standing burns more calories naturally integrates the nervous system' pattern  movement much better    far superior method  training the human body  move with much more precision  power Instead  wasting time   guided resistance machine use your body' weight medicine ball rubber tubing stability ball dumbell  cable pulley Your joints will thank you  the long run

10	 don' think  will  able  convey  this review just how wonderful  think this book Two years ago  was the fittest  thinnest  ever had been  And then   behold  discovered that  were going   welcoming baby number three into the world! Completely unexpected   little older than before  was terrified  would gain  lot  weight   managed  keep the weightgain down but still after the birth   happy little surprise  had 25 pounds  lose  was anxious  get  offThe truth was  didn' know the truth about eating  the truth about exercising  had never lifted weights  was  longer  physically active   once was   bought the Firm  the stick thing that went with  but the information that program came with didn'  into the whys  the ways  even though there was some instruction   calendar  didn' understand about the physiology  eating properly  often  how one must let their muscles rest after exercisingBill Phillips' book was the perfect introduction for    twelve weeks just  promised  was back   smaller size  And  learned  much about weight loss  proper nutrition  working out with weights  how  improve  aerobic/cardio routine  well  His book completely whet  appetite for more knowledge regarding proper eating/dieting/nutrition/etc  because  Body for Life  have read  much more about nutrition  exercise  this  now  full-fledged interest  mineThe only criticism  have now two years after  have read   several years after publication  that  really needs   updated The current thought  that one must eat immediately after working out Body for Life states you should wait  hour  Also the Body for Life website which  refers   recommends throughout his book  now owned  operated  EAS  food supplement company not Bill Phillips   used  ' really like  see something new  Bill Phillips '  inspiration used     ' really like  see something new  Bill Phillips '  inspiration
10	 went  the BFL program for the prescribed 12 weeks  noticed absolutely  CHANGE WHATEVER  Being the glutton for punishment  was back then  decided   for ANOTHER 12 weeks with the exact same resultsNOTHING  The problem  that   what  known   "hard gainer"---someone who  not genetically predisposed  gaining lean muscle mass  Some people are simply more genetically gifted but they are most definitely  the MINORITY  Phillips whether through simple oversight  ignorance ( suspect   the latter) fails  mention  even imply that this       several reviews have succinctly mentioned the BFL Program  simply  glorified advertisement for Myoplex the okay-tasting but obscenely expensive supplement created  EAS Phillips' former company   will admit  did like the pre-mixed Myoplex but the supplements are prohibitively costly for those who don' bring  six-figure incomes  Also correct  the generally sophmoric tone  feel  the writing itself which make Phillips sound like  stereotypical Palooka Joe type   would recommend material from someone who sounds halfway intelligent  articulate    Finally Phillips also authored his own supplement review publication   course his Myoplex products recieved glowing reviews   would say that this product  that product from this other company was 'okay' but that his were better  Very egotistical  Skip BFL  you want  save money   should have been called Buy From  For Life because that  exactly what you will  doing
4	Although the BFL program  not perfect  think some  the criticisms against  are  Phillips although  seller  supplements does not push them  the book   far   can remember  makes  mention  any  the supplements other than his Myoplex MRP  And  never states that   required    mentioned  recommended but not pushed  And   only recommended for convenience  One could easily use  different MRP  its place  The important thing  the diet (other than low fat low simple-carb small portions balanced protein/complex-carb ratio)   eat every 3 hours  Take  look  the "3-Hour Diet" for more about why you should  this  The MRPs help you  that  ' been buying Myoplex online from bodybuildingcom for $131/packet  That' really quite cheap for  brand that   well-recognized  EAS  Again you could use Slim-Fast  you want    reduce BFL  being nothing more than  advertising promotion for Myoplex does  great disservice  all the people who have add positive results  all those who could  The best thing about BFL  the focus  changing the way you live  Through eating better (maybe not the best)  exercising regularly (maybe not perfectly) you achieve great results  ' tried many programs before  ' tried mixing  matching  None have kept  motivated like this program  Nothing has given  results like this  Are there better nutritional guidelines  better exercise methods?  Absolutely  But BFL   very simplistic way  get started   trainers  gyms  nutritionists  possibly even  supplements   highly recommend this program for anyone who  serious about changing their lives

14	  clear that the main purpose  this book   peddle more  Bill Phillips' beloved Myoplex Phillips claims that everyone  his program who achieved amazing results used Myoplex which was rather saddening considering how outrageously expensive the Myoplex crap  Whatever you  don' buy into this stupidity   Phillips has absolutely nothing  say about stretching   The nutrition section lacks  that  places emphasis  "meat & potatoes" ( most importantly meat  wait Myoplex) leaves fruit & vegetables out  the cold  the book  believe there are meal plans for three days you want more you' have  buy Phillips' other book "Eating-for-LIFE" Phillips' plan follows 3 meats 3 carbs 3 vegetables per day interspersed with Myoplex  more Myoplex products (for anyone who knows anything about nutrition this  quite outrageous!)   also found the 1-10 intensity levels amuzing  can see someone fretting   gym somewhere now: "Was that  9   10 Was that set  4  5 Hell  may have even been  6 for all  know"  Yeah don' waste your money  this book (even  Bill Phillips  rather hot)  recommend "Moving Toward Balance: 8 Weeks  Yoga with Rodney Yee"  Rodney Yee 
10	For 2 entire years  lived  the priniples  this book    easy  read  understand   have only one problem with :  The author assumes that every individual  the same  Don' get  wrong  got decent results applying these principles  Though  all have the same muscles (men & women)  need  work them similarly (depending upon the results you wish) not all   get the results which  take  mean that not all   should   EXACTLY the same program   recommend Tom Venuto' -book "Burn the Fat Build the Muscle"  addition  BFL

15	Let'  honest with what Bill Phillips  intending    "Body for Life": sell more Myoplex This artificially flavored fortified  caloried meal replacement  not real food  only panders  the root  the obesity problem which   growing laziness  Americans  take  upon themselves  look after their health including preparing their own nutritious meals And even  this MRP was good for you (discounting its high sugar content  oxidized cholesterol) you could easily concoct your own with generic whey protein   protein blend  some powdered maltodextrine for considerably less moneyThere' Bill Phillips exercise program: 2 days upper body 2 days lower body 2 days cardio + rest day  course  doesn' tell you much about form  each movement  the benefit  using certain weight bearing exercises over others  producing functional strength safely instead  just pretty muscles  risking joint & ligament problems All Phillips requires  that you reach some subjectively determined "level 10 output"  vague physiological descriptionThe dietary plan  wonderfully rich  starches  sugars for the overweight person increased consumption  which worked  well  addressing our nation' obesity problem over the last 3 decades  you can read for yourself  USDA published material Simply stay away from all that evil butter cream  animal tallows After all  see how rampant obesity  cardiovascular illness has become  people who eat these foods such  the French Masai  Swiss  how epidemic  was  the buffalo-eating Plains Indians before they were WesternizedSome  the "evidence"  the book  ridiculous such  how the bear  animal that gorges itself instead  grazing  overweight  slothful  would laugh myself into  seizure   ever saw Bill  try  take   bear single-handedly  with  few  his bodybuilder friends Has  ever watched  single nature show  the species?

41	The Body-for-Life program consists   low fat low simple carbohydrate diet coupled with intense aerobic  strength training  The program surely works but only  few people are likely  have the discipline  follow   least for very long    superficial level there  nothing overtly wrong  even controversial about the program  Hardly anyone would argue against  diet composed  adequate protein little saturated fat  few sugars  Few would argue against the need for  complementary exercise program that combines aerobics with strength training  But look  little closer  you' begin  realize that  few features make the program extraordinarily difficult    First fat reduction  the early goal  the exercise  intended   performed   empty stomach  The idea   tax the body when blood sugar  low  there   recourse but for the body  burn fat for energy  The problem  that empty stomach training takes more discipline than most people have  ' made even more difficult  the recommendation  exercise first thing  the morning  Few people have the desire  roll out  bed  pump iron  The second difficulty  that the aerobic exercise  done  `wind sprint' fashion which anyone with any exercise experience will tell you  absolutely the hardest way  train  The author refers    his "high point" technique but most  the rest  the world knows   interval training  ' the heart  soul  the program  there'  getting around    you' not using the high point technique you' not doing the program  Third the weight training involves multiple sets  increasing weight   done   aerobic pace  You  upwards  35 sets  46 minutes  That'  brutal pace  given the amount  weight changing that needs   done you' better have multiple sets  weights  The author prefers dumbbells which other exercise specialists consider dangerous for beginners  Finally the whole exercise part  the program  done   calorie restriction diet  While you' supposed  eat six times  day the three `meals'  three `snacks' add   less than 2000 calories  For the amount  exercise required that' practically  starvation diet   ' sure the people  the photos must have gotten the observed result  the promised time but  what cost?  The drop-out rate for this program must  astronomic  Finally  word about supplements  ' true that while the author owns  supplement company  does not spend  large number  pages talking about them  But what  does say would certainly encourage their use   says flat out that  one  knows has completed the 12-week program without using Myoflex  Call  crazy but that sounds like  pretty strong endorsement   you  use Myoflex  forewarned that you are going  have  whopping protein intake   fact  you use  three times  day   recommends you' going  take  135 grams  protein from this source alone  Along with other meals there'  pretty good chance you' exceed 200mg/day which  pretty darn high   summary ' bet that only  select few will  able  complete this program supplements  not  The rest   will have  fashion  lighter weight version  The basic diet  fine though you' want  have  close look  supplements since there   bewildering myriad  possibilities  ' the exercise program that' the killer though  ' have  get watered down  bit for the masses

18	You' see  lot  criticism  this page from people who haven' tried this program  can' believe that 20 minutes  cardio three times per week plus three 45-minute weights routines will  anything for you let alone totally transform your body  just three months Sounds  little crazy doesn' ? Perhaps Bill Phillips  His quirky writing style which moves   erratic arc between jingoism down-home folksy wisdom  quasi-religious fervor certainly doesn' help his credibility nor  some  the quite simply unbelievable photos  his "success stories"   that wasn' enough the constant promoting  his overpriced dietary supplements should have everyone' alarm bells ringing   this just  200-page pitch for protein powder?  might  but hose off the hype  what you actually have here   solid program that really can help you get started  the road  fitness For  the genius  Phillips' program  that sticking    actually possible You can have  busy life  still   everything the program requires - better yet you can  perfectly comfortable  happy about doing   doesn' take hours per day You don' even need     gym (you can  everything  home with  set  dumb-bells  bike   bench) You get  eat almost constantly (yes even carbs!)  you never feel hungry Then one day per week you get  slob about  nothing  eat whatever you like With this program you start  feel better almost immediately  you will lose weight build muscle  look better - even within the first four weeks  know this because ' done  Sure you' not going  get those dramatic muscle gains  you don' use the protein supplements ( their equivalents) but  found this program was still immensely beneficial without them  the very least  will break you out  bad eating habits establish exercise  part  your daily routine  most importantly  lets you demonstrate  yourself that you CAN  those things That boost  self-confidence can put you  the path even   ultimately isn' the one Phillips recommends  you think you have  willpower despise exercise  yet are still concerned about your weight  strongly recommend you give this program  shot Take  seriously though Read the book thoroughly  follow the steps closely - especially the parts  the High Point interval training  diet Knowing  bit  the "less  more" science behind why this program works will help you overcome your seemingly logical objections  the promises  makes And once you get into the swing   ' actually pretty good fun -    just still high  endorphins? you CAN  those things That boost  self-confidence can put you  the path even   ultimately isn' the one Phillips recommends  you think you have  willpower despise exercise  yet are still concerned about your weight  strongly recommend you give this program  shot Take  seriously though Read the book thoroughly  follow the steps closely - especially the parts  the High Point interval training  diet Knowing  bit  the "less  more" science behind why this program works will help you overcome your seemingly logical objections  the promises  makes And once you get into the swing   ' actually pretty good fun -    just still high  endorphins?

11	Bill Phillips has  great program here for many reasons   like probably most people who read the book had been working  getting  shape for years  ' read one article  what  says read another article  what  says  ' read book after book with principle after principle  The problem with that approach  that ' like trying  become  physician  reading  bunch  journals  practicing  dolls  The only way that  know how  reliably train physicians  through  standard academic program with milestones goals peer review  accountability    smaller scale ' similar with fitness  The milestones timelines goals  specifics  this program are  more reliable success strategy than just trying when you feel like   doing whatever you just read about  The structure  the program can  seen  somewhat like  class  school   works for similar reasons  The fact that   standard  has already been tried  many people   big plus   book  The program employs  diet that  reasonable (especially when using the Eating-for-Life cookbook  freezing the meals)  aerobics program that  short  efficient   emphasis  weight training which  key  maintaining  even increasing your lean body mass    were  make some observations about the program  insights  had late  the game ' this: conservatively you can estimate  weight loss  15-25 /week for men with  increase  muscle weight  about 5 /week  For women ' more like 75/125 loss  25 increase  Base your goals  where you want   body percentage wise  For men 5%  bodybuilder 6-12%  athletic 13-18%  about average  above that  probably not your goal  Women are about 15 times those numbers  Use those numbers  calculate your number  weeks  terms  worst case  best case  make  realistic goal  And also make smaller goals  Commit  three months first then perhaps commit  six more  you need   After three months  this program  you really try hard  get through  you won' want  quit  The second thing   you fail don' give   Learn your lessons  keep going  The quest isn' just   able  get  shape ' also  iron out some  your tendencies that cause you  fail  For   routinely would fail   diet  then try  compensate for  slip  Don'  this recognize that you' not likely  sustain  rate  loss over  particular amount (1-2 pounds)  don' succumb  the temptation  try  cut corners  What you' done  added  week  your program  slipping  Accept this  there will   problem  long  your lifestyle  maintainable  Basically look  your failures  successes  long  they are failures you learn from  Also forget the negative things people say about you not being able  accomplish this  This  something anyone can  with the proper determination  Best  luck!  
3	 would like  see more attention paid  weight loss  muscle development  authors who aren' trying  sell protein powders  other supplements ' read the book  find some  the recommendations    little bit hard  swallow  don' know about anyone else but  don' have the money  spend  over-priced protein shakes nor   have the time  eat six meals  day  also find  hard  believe that anyone could achieve the kinds  results  twelve weeks (without the use  steroids) that the people  the inside cover managed  get

32	BFL contains  lot  motivational speeches but  the subtantive issues  diet  fitness  has very little  say  The writing style  very informal  unpolished even  comparison  other fitness books  Nice before/after pics  the inside front cover but  doubt they were achieved after  mere 12 weeks  the programPhilips tells you   20 mins  cardio 3x  week but says nothing about what kind  cardio    how they differ from each other  walking  swimming  tennis  Which form  cardio you choose affects which weight training exercises you should perform both  balance out your body  also for specific injury-prevention exercises  For  better discussion  cardio  geneeral fitness ' recommend Cross Training for Dummies  Tony Ryan  Martica HeanerThe BFL program relies   vague "intensity index"   one-size-fits-all   well designed weight training program takes into account body type (obese  slightly overweight) goal (weight loss muscle growth  strength gain)  experience (beginner intermediate advanced)  The recommended 5 sets  12-10-8-6-12 reps are questionable for beginners who are presumable the target audience for the book  His cheesy cadence for raising the weight (say: Body for Life)  lowering the weight (say:   building  Body for Life) illustrate the general shallowness  the book  For  serious  comprehensive weight training book try the Men' Health Home Workout Bible  Lou Schuler  Michael Mejia diet BFL  confusing ' skip this section entirely  The chapter consists   table  permitted foods   short list  "good carbs" but doesn' explain why certain foods are recommended   recommends low fat foods but also denigrates low fat high carb diets  Then  recommends the potato which current best practice avoids due  its high glycemic load   Phillips low fat  low carb?   can' tell  The only thing ' clear about  that you should buy his protein shakes  Instead  this mishmash ' recommend Eat Drink   Healthy  Walter WillettOverall reading  following this book may  better than doing nothing for the next 12 weeks but there are much better beginner diet  workout guides available   you need motivation look  other less over-the-top books  better yet  friends  family  inside YOU

16	Firstly some background Before this book  was  39 year old woman who had never been  any kind  diet  exercise regime- had pretty much spent  entire life effortlessly thin Then  quit smoking  gained 50 pounds  9 months  the horrorWhile searching for  solution   weight woes  decided  wanted something that would promote  complete lifestyle change- not just some quick fix scheme This program really seemed like something  could  for the rest   life Eat 6 times  day? Hey  love  eat! Exercise 6 times  week? Not such  bad idea The real clincher was having that blessed one day off each week  eat drink   merry  has now been 12 weeks    here  tell all you couch potatoes that   doable! Nope  don' look like any  those dramatic before  after photos Sadly  was  worse shape than the lot  them And   completely honest  probably only gave  80%   efforts But believe   see  big difference  body  taking  some definition  can see those muscles straining  the surface! Look   can   ANYONE can   Seriously  Quitting smoking was  lot harder than this program - all  gotta   flip the switch  your mind that says "Enough  enough!" This book gives you all the tools you' need  take  from there

10	Thi book  NOT the -all end-all  diet/exercise books out there  '   The before  after pictures  the book are pure fantasy regardless  what the author claims   human being loses that much fat  gains that much muscle tone  the number  weeks  claims   that right there should tell you  little something about ' Bill Phillips  Whether ' intentional  not   making claims  could not possibly back  with facts   some degree part  Bill' diet recommendation   plug for his EAS product line   personally feel  prescribes WAY too much protein   can only offer  opinion  his powdered meal replacement product - YUCK!   knew  was  trouble when  mixed the first serving   commercial milkshake mixer   actually bogged the machine down the stuff gets  artificially thick   also leaves  taste not unlike the fumes from burning plastic  your mouth   thought  was going  get sick for the rest  that day  Fortunately Vitaminscom let  return  for  full refund  the outragously expensive price (75 bucks!)  What did  like?   agree with his idea  5  6 small meals per day accompanied  loads  water   still use his aerobics routine   treadmill  Bill' enthusiasm that you can " this" (lose weight  get  shape)  evident throughout the book   bit contagious  Bottomline  adapted his meal plan   own life  made modifications that suited  drank lots  water (this  key)  worked out like  mad man for 12 months  lost 107 pounds  ended   enviable shape until  was diagnosed with brain cancer  the doctors told  stop lifting weights  gave  steroids that make you eat everything  sight Plus radiation made  crave fried chicken!

17	 started  this program 51 days ago   was  299 pounds when  weighed   the first day    today  weighed   269  That' 30 pounds  51 days  Everyday more weight  coming off   feel great  look forward   workouts  the gym   even cheated throughout the holidays  still lost 4 pounds over  two week period all the people complaining about the shakes don' use them    point  the book did  see  place that said you must use Myoplex  some other supplement   didn'   eat six meals  day   have yet  have  supplement shake although   considering them  the future  There  quite  bit  motivational fluff but  kept  interestedJust for reference:   did not buy the Success Journal  You can download the same information from []     free  There are extras  the Success Journal  you need  like  read the extra motivational stuff  Eating for Life came out when  was about  month into    purchased  ASAP   have not made anything from that book that wasn' just delicious  Plus  have made quite  few  the recipes from the web site  Granted this program may not  for everyone but  worked well for    would recommend   anyone looking  lose some weight  Remember  was large  begin with   weight loss would probably  faster than someone looking  take off 10-20 pounds  Also keep  mind that muscle  heavier than fat  adding muscle will definitely keep weight higher believe  this book    new supporter  Bill Phillips!!!
6	Warning: unless you have the time  spend 60-90 minutes  the gym 6 days per week skip this program now how can  full life program last only 12 weeks?! Well the idea  that you need  minimum  12 weeks  get into shape but then supposedly you stick with   the long run For most people this  impractical  impossible - even for 12 weeks The workout schedule  simply too time consuming  you' still  for  read This plan works  have followed something very similar   (similar diet but reduced workout schedule)   transformed    demanding but sensible  you should end  with  long term transformation  your body This   -nonsense approach  the age old adage "eat right  exercise" The author realised that such advice was lost  most people because there   much confusing advice  what these things mean   spells  out for you  you are determined  succeed you can'  wrong with this system ' read them all: Atkins Eat Right 4 Your Type The Zone Fit For Life BFL  the only plan ' recommend  friendsThere' one caveat  have one major problem with BFL which  that  involves pushing Myoplex meal replacements distributed  the BFL corporate vehicle EAS   very possible  achieve the same gains without taking expensive meal replacements however you' have  work that out for yourselfToss aside the commercialism  you can find  tough but very good plan here But because  the blatant advertising  taints the entire work  don' like reading  book when  don' entirely trust the motives  the author For that they lose  star

4	 lost 30 lbs  slashed  bodyfat  half using the 12 week program  ' tried many other programs  the past  never had success  There' something about this book maybe its the fact that  doesnt drown you  technical  scientific information  just gets right  the point  One note: this program assumes you are really willing  put  110% effort  have  strong desire  change   you   you follow the program you will see results  doubt

5	The Body for life program  more than just insightful ' inspirational  lot  fitness material  focused  much  complicated lifting techniques  point counting that they forget about the main problem Most people know about working out  eating right but they lack the motivation  self control  get them  change their bad habits The introductory chapters deal with helping the reader develop  sense  self-trust   many respects self esteem The contest that Phillips recommends you enter  also just the spark that people need  get them over the hump Money   great motivator  even  you complete the challenge  don' win you still have  great body  the end<>  terms  the effectiveness  the material  the book how can one question the thousands  success stories  remarkable before  after photos included  the book Whenever someone can make the kinds  leaps  physical  mental fitness that these people have made they can inspire others   the same The book also includes  many powerful passages that give the reader  sense  hope worth  pride <> The workout plan  right  target Many people have heard the term " pain  gain"  this  not always true  found that many times  the past  had the problem  not being able  complete  workouts because  was still sore from the week before After working out using this method for several weeks  can attest that  workouts were more effective   was fresh enough  actually see improvements  strength that had eluded  for  while <> There   doubt about the effectiveness  the Body for Life system but  might not  practical for many Americans For one eating six meals  day can  expensive Even  you had the money  buy that much food where would you find the time  cook ? The system may not work for all Americans because  fails  account for the many Americans whose schedules  lives are toohectic for 6 meals  day  6 workouts  week<> This book  excellent for someone who truly wants  improve his  her fitness level whether  not they win the prize The workouts  food preparation  take  time but this book does suggest that people will have more time because  increased energy Also  round-the-clock help line  provided  help people deal with any problems they might encounter
4	For the most part ' very positive about this book ' almost  the middle  the program  have lost about 8lbs  35% body fat ( wasn' really over-weight just out  shape)  have  agree with the concerns about not recommending stretching The first day that  followed his program for lower body was the first time  had ever worked  calves  the following 3 days were TERRIBLE!  had  call  sick   job because   muscles  this may have been prevented with proper warning About the shakes '  option not  necessity  the program However this  not  program for someone who isn'  all motivated You are never hungry with the suggested method  eating but  have  admit  still count down the seconds  cheat day when  can run  McDonalds! Good luck  everyone who has the guts  try this!

4	This   good for for beginning weight lifters  The back  the book has about four exercises for each body part explained well with photos  For someone brand new  lifting this section  probably worth the cost  the book  Phillip' lifting principles are not new they basically revolve around Weider' principle  pre-exhaustion  While Phillip' chapter  diet contains  few errors  doesn' claim    dietician  Following his eating plan (assuming one doesn' buy into the force-fed EAS shakes) probably wouldn' cause any harm (although   lacking  sufficient vegetables)  would  helpful for anyone who has struggled with  eating plan    simple  does not require weighing  measuring  Vegetarians  vegans will need  refer  his website (bodyforlife) for information  what  suggests they eat --   not  the book  All  all   not  bad book   main annoyance (besides the EAS sales pitch) was that quite  few  his statements seem  come out  left field   they are proven  research some sort  reference list  bibliography would have been helpful  The book also lacks  index

15	 had heard alot about this book  really hoped that  could help  get back into shape   didn'  The author shamefully uses this book  push the supplements  sells   Phillips seems  know alot about bodybuilding but not how  apply    average person who needs  lose weight   obviously does not have  backround  nutrition  has not done his research This book was really  waste  time  money  The only thing  Phillips has done well  con people into buying his advertisement
10	This book   very eloquent version  the truth  That    the right  healthy way  lose weight   isn'  easy way out   isn' unrealistic   think everyone has hit the nail  the head about this book   lost 37 pounds  4 pants sizes  12 weeks  Bill Phillips' doesn' teach you any miracle diets   teaches proper nutrition mixed with regular workouts  produce  healthy lifestyle   makes  simple for you  matter your age  gender
5	Persuading someone  adhere   program for twelve weeks might   better than doing nothing assuming that some  them continue the program indefinately However  falls into the same trap  most fitness  weight control books--most  the participants have not decided that this   program that they must continue for life Doing something that makes rapid changes  the body  counterproductive because the body' homeostatic mechanism works  prevent rapid change Therefore  see people losing fat from the fat cells rapidly only  regain  plus more  judge the effectiveness  the book  must look  least 5-10 years down the road  see what has happened  those who began the body for life program  new book written   Harvard trained physician titled Mind Over Fatter explains why rapid changes  the body tend   temporary  explains why gradual changes are more apt   permanent

0	Bill phillips   incredible psychological motivator  can really inspire you  face your toughest challenges whether   bodybuilding  lose fat  gain muscle  The techniques  his book will produce results but could also cause you  get injured especially  you are new  weight training   believes that you must seek  add more  more weight over the 12 week period  his program   know from personal experience that you only risk injury from such  approach  You are better off doing the same exercises with lighter weights  using the Darden Ellington super slow strength training methods  This will also cause necessary muscle tears required  build muscle but without substantial risk  injury  His assertion that aerobic exercise performed first think  the morning   empty stomach maximizes fat loss  supported  research  His assertion that 20 minutes  intermittent high  moderate intensity aerobic exercise  the only sure fire way  lose fat  questionable  This  based  his belief that your body will adapt  the same type  intensity  aerobic exercise over  period  time which will negate fat burning  Simply doing different types  aerobic exercise(treadmill one day stairmaster another day stationary bike another day rowing machine another day)  doing  little bit  different aerobic exercise (10 minutes treadmill 10 minutes stationary bike 10 minutes stairmaster/rowing machine) the same session will enable you  perform aerobic exercise  different intensity levels without killing yourself  Plus you will have the added benefits  working different muscle groups through the different aerobic exercise  Finally Bill provides before  after pictures  some  the people who have undergone his 12 week transformation  Come  get real   you take  real close look  those pictures you can bet your bottom dollar that they have been touched    those people are for real they either took steroids  had plastic surgery  both  Anyway the point  that  get results like that without the use  steroids  plastic surgery  would likely take 5 plus years  very disciplined eating  weight training  Bill Phillips   disappointed that you would stoop  low just  market your book   think people are more apt  appreciate  respect honesty than dishonesty  Sorry  that offends you
4	 you like gimmicky fluff this book  for you The reviews only confirm just how gullible  ignorant many people are ( especially liked the one  the woman who said that her fat was converted  muscle while following the program -- which  true  the biological equivalent  being able  walk  water Sigh!
10	 really  think that Body for Life (BFL)   great book  ' far superior  dozens  similar books  the market  Bill has  great motivational disposition  has good guidelines inducing motivation  structure  the common person that wants  get fit  needs some upbeat guidance<> myself   fitness trainer  have waded through tons  junk  find BFL   above average  While BFL  definately effective  feel that there are some parts   that are just  bit too simplified  For example   feel that his nutritional guidelines definately  work however there are  few other books ' seen with similar guidelines that give more info  calories protein/carb needs etc  Bill could have included that  BFL for those who want  fine tune  (yes  know that his "portion" system  very simple but   VERY important  know how  create effective eating plans  knowing calorie intake  diet needs   can  quite simple  explain  done correctly)With that said BFL   LIFE CHANGER   think that    accessable  the masses that  can affect millions  lives!<>  recommend    just feel like  has some areas that are too oversimplified  For people who want  get more precision  their fitness knowledge  recommend getting "Hot Point fitness"  supplement BFL  ' quite similar with  few additional insights that are helpful (precision eating  cardio)<>Good Luck  keep the momentum going!!
2	  have  say  was really cautious about buying another book  the subject but  was pleasently suprised great meal plans weight  training plans  ' really kept great weight control ' worth  thats for sure
5	All this    motivtional book  This book  filled with all sorts  just fluff  filler   has  little bit  fitness  food advice but not near enough  warrent even 2 stars   feel very [disappointed]  this book  Buyer beware  ' advising you  beware
2	don' buy this book   waste  time  papereverything    common sense  could  said   few words: eat healthy small portions  exercise daily  drink lots  water was not motivating  all
37	 think Bill Phillips has  relatively decent concept for  body-building course Most  the advice  gives  very common-sense: don' over-eat eat healthier exercise more get into  system focus  progress (not perfection) etc etc '  great foundation for becoming healthier   *did* see results   however believe that roughly one-third  one-half  this 200 page book  pretty much worthless the end  the book for example Phillips prints enough copies  the suggested progress reports  complete six days  his program (this  about 25 pages  the book) Please note however that these copies are all exactly the same Since  doesn' give you enough for the entire program you' going  have  make photocopies anyway These copies are just filler for the booka waste  paper  moneyAnother waste  paper (  opinion)  the printing  several testemonials thoughout the text Roughly 30 pages  the book are nothing but stories about the people who have gone through the course  their lives  few might have been interesting but  think the large number   bit excessive  certainly wastes spacePhillips also spends  lot  time advertising his Body-for-LIFE website (Which incidentally  found   comically unhelpful)  also takes considerable space  the book  tell you about Myoplex  nutritional supplement  promotes ( *does* however admit that this  optional)Finally  think his own psychological mumbo-jumbo throughout most  the book' fourth section ("The Training-for-LIFE Experience")  pretty ridiculous ' not sure that  buy his "high-point techniques"  all   think ' absolutely hilarious that  recommends chanting "  building  Body-for-LIFE" while exercisingNevertheless   said  the begining  think Phillips has  good concept  this book  followed the program (loosely admittedly)   DID see  definite change Others did  well  lost  lot  fat  gained muscle ' definitely something worth investigating  recommendation however   save your [money]  check the book out  your local library Read  quickly photocopy the relevant pages (probably  few  the exercises the food chart  maybe the daily progress reports)  change your life *far* more cheaply
14	 followed this program  lost 3 dress sizes  the first 3 weeks but without losing  pound  All that fat  flab became muscle without  even being aware     did the exercises each day  followed the diet plan  outlines    states  the book you  NOT have  use the meal replacement products produced  his company   did not start using them myself until the 4th week   loved the products  well   the end  went from 155 lbs (   female 5'3")  124 lbs replacing fat with muscle   wasn' even all that hard!   ordering  second copy  the book since the one  received was borrowed   have recommended this plan  anyone who has mentioned  desire  have more energy lose some weight  get into shape  DEFINITELY give this program  chance

12	This   very beneficial book especially the Exercise Guide which ' been using extensively now for two weeks However there are some points that  personally didn' like: First the author seems intent  several places  the book  plug/promote the Myoplex "Performance-Nutrition Shake" which  made  his company (EAS)  sold  its Website   writes   sample  the Nutrition-for-Life Method Daily Progress Report that  drinks this shake 3 times  day (out  the 6 meals recommended)  then  comes back  page 121  writes "Another thing that could help you gain muscle size  strength faster   use  EAS supplement called Phosphagen     This supplement contains creatine  nutrient which has been shown  dozens  university studies  enhance size  muscle strength  well  energy    The other supplement  recommend  enhance the muscle-building effects  the Training-for-Life Experience  HMB    The only supplements ' using right now are Myoplex   EAS supplement called BetaGen (which contains both creatine  HMB)    When  consume these supplements  get the vitamins minerals protein extra antioxidants creatine HMB glutamine energy-rich carbohydrates  other micronutrients  need  don' make  any more complicated than that"!!Also  response   fellow reviewers who say that Bill Phillips NEVER says that Myoplex  necessary  required for the success  the program  cite the following quote directly from page 90/91  the book: " use Myoplex every day  have for the past four years Without the advantage  offers  don' believe  would have been able  stick with this nutrition method which has helped  stay  top shape year after year Plus ' not the type that likes  take handfuls  vitamin pills  whatnot ' too busy for that   guess  that you are too    Now ' not saying you can' get good results with just regular food That ispossible especially  you have time  shop for  prepare six quality whole-food meals day   day out However many  the people  coach just don' have time  eat six whole-food meals  day  for them Myoplex   solution" [ you see the subliminal message ' trying  convey  the reader here?!!]  although  mentions  the book that all proceeds from the sale  the book will   Make  Wish Foundation (his favorite charity)   using the book  promote the sale  his shakes  other supplements  the Website!! This point alone shakes  trust  him  what  saysSecond  specifies that the weight training exercises should not take more than 46 minutes  day (whether ' upper body  lower body workout)  criticism here  that  should have warned beginners that ( least  the beginning) these exercises could take much longer for them until they get the hang  them Failing   that   view leads those beginners  feel that they have failed  that they are not good enoughThird  last The free Food Day  recommends can    own opinion  way for many ( some) people  over-indulge  the point  sabotaging their diet  unfortunately does not provide much needed guidelines  follow  that day
5	 thought this book was  easy book  read with good information  The core  the program  getting out there  working hard  achieve the results you are looking for  Nutrition  everything  getting  better body  the exercise program  well advised  Picking  this book was great for motivating   get back   what  knew  could    had mastered the " sweat" work out  had poor eating habits  Weight training  high intensity cardio workouts   great regime  getting fit   thought some  the before  after shots seemed unreal but after  did the program (with great discipline)  too had some amazing before  after shots  Well you can' see  6-pack yet (' need  lose 5-7% more body fat) but you can definately tell  have not only lost weight but have great muscle defination!  The program works the book  easy  read  can serve  great motivation / inspiration  get   better youAlso read Laura Freeman' Feel Great Naked  highly recommend that book  well

22	Bill Phillips knows how  write about looking fit   knows how  market  too   owner  EAS supplements  Muscle Media magazine     position  know  lot  Bill gives about  much   thinks Americans are willing  hear  Body For Life (BFL) doesn' criticize anyone going through middle age  feeling insecure because they don' look like Britney Spears  Brad Pitt   doesn' rail against the pseudo-fitness fanatics who are just vanity freaks with distorted values  Nope Bill never broaches how emotionally unhealthy    try  look physically healthy young  sexy   culture that has  narrow minded view  beauty  BFL  selling the magic beans   well being that come from objectifying one' self  basing our personal worth  the external perceptionOpen  BFL  you will see countless pictures  people who transformed their physiques  Bill will tell you every reason you should  eating right (not less!)  working out regularly ' more Stephen Covey than personal trainer   really understands the psychology  why people don' get   change their livesfor good   you are looking for someone  convince you  get  work  transforming your body this book   informative  invaluable resourceBut with all that saidthis  still  book about fitness written  America The reason the masses are buying this book has more    with American psychology than the quality  life that BFL adherents are achieving  The masses are obsessed with "looking" fit young & sexy  the reason this book  selling  that the book does outline one  the most efficient ways   about getting there fastwell that   you think all you have    drop some  become the you that you were born  There  much more money  selling 'trim young  fit' than  selling bodybuilding even though Bill comes from  bodybuilding background  The twelve week BFL cycle  nothing more than  extended bodybuilding pre-contest cycle ( which bodybuilders stop focusing  building mass  drop fat while maintaining  much musculature  possible)  The twelve week cycle gets results  BFL' credit    superb  you need step  step instructions  don' trust your own intuition  have been led astray  the TONS  misinformation about healthy weight loss   have seen Bill' persuasive powers over those who believed the puritanical notions  sacrificing one' appetite  starving  the way  lose weight  Bill  putting the reader through  metabolic crash course  burn fat without leaving him emaciated but  this 12 week challenge healthy  the long term?   would say you are far better off health-wise for following Bill' system rather than nothing but there are more flexible ( not better) ways   about being healthy The BFL system leaves out the whole mental aspect  being healthy Sure Bill talks about changing your life  building your confidence but isn' there something mentally absent with grown-ups who still feel like they have  compete with the pretty people   accepted  those terms  And even  you subscribe  the theory that you have  try  fit  does the path have    rigid  Spartan?For instance Bill wants the reader  sacrifice performance for fat burning  Run  bike    empty stomach  you will burn more fat ( your glucose levels are already low)  You aren' going   very fast though   you are into competition the 12 week challenge  not for youWeight train first thing  the morning ramping  your intensity with short rests between sets while you push through 20  more sets   blistering pace   you haven' touched weights  years you will  any resistance training but the more knowledgeable will recognize that Bill  more concerned with maintaining  constant high heart rate  keeping muscle mass  The somewhat experienced weight trainer will probably not respond much  the weights  strength gains  will have  modify the program  continue meeting strength goals hour after you workout you can have your first meal  You are going  have  maintain  one meal every 25 hour pace  get all six meals  before its time  think about retiring for your full night' rest  Don' worry the meals are small enough that you will remain ready  eat again later   Here the goal   maintain  flat steady metabolic rate  insulin levels  the blood stream  But  this kind  eating practical?  People  the BFL system that are successful with their diet are like born-agains: hard   around  they consciously focus  their diet all day with dreams  the salvation that lies  just 12 weeks  Bill argues that  becomes automatic  requires less planning  thought after  while  This may  true but   still  huge time commitment for the purpose  maintaining  lean physique  perhaps being  more healthy than  person eating   more intuitive schedule  This still  one  the best weight loss books around  The twelve week challenge   safe  sane way  lose weight  But the title  misleading  Body for Life suggests you will have  life  the BFL converts all agree this  the result  But look  little closer  you will see that BFL  all about getting results  the external world  keeping busy enough that you never have  look within  your life you already like your life you should probably pass  the challenge but read  for the info anyway

3	The first thing you notice when you pick  the book   wall  before  after pictures that "cannot  real"  when  showed people the pictures they did not believe that they were real but since  bought the book  had  prove these people wrong   tried the formula out   worked for !  The only problem  that  had some major life changes  few months ago   reverted back   old habits  lost everything  gained  For those who   not believe this program works because  did not work for them understand that they are probably not motivated  will never reach the potential  the examples given unless they move past this challenge  themselves  Good luck everyone!

10	 started this program out  curiosity  wasnt that fat but was probably  the worst shape   life  was 5'10 194 pounds  starting  get  bit   beer gut  had some love handles going  was just feeling sluggish  looking for  way  feel better  started BFL because  had  total package  simple nutrition rules   easy  follow excercise plan  took   right away  didnt really need the whole Rah Rah you can   sections but  did help  visualize  goals  never felt hungry the whole time   lost over 30 pounds  scale weight while adding quite  bit  Muscle  dropping pretty heavily  body fat % During the program  was odd how many people asked  what  was doing  made comments how good  looked Even  male  workers said things  dont look like the guys  the pictures  any means but  weight  lower then  has been since  graduated High School  even though   not super ripped  defined   looking quite good physically  went through  12 weeks  kept right  going  have hit  plateau but  think that  more   with  seriousness  this point then the program  whats bad about BFL? Planning  really takes  ton  planning   does make you change your eating habits  fit   many meals  you  this   seriously  dont    all  really works  you work with  Sometimes  was frustrating trying  cram meals  but its well worth  Other then that  have  complaints  wish  could shake Bill Phillips hand for helping  get back  good physical shape!!
1	This   very inspirational book There   specific weight aerobic  eating plan that  easy  follow  doesn' take much time    read the book  one night  started the next day ( have  far kept   longer than any other program  have tried) For people who need structure  motivation this  the book  also   great way  get introduced  weight training   worth  purchase for that alone One bad word  the EAS supplements the "Myoplex" shakes that the book recommends you have three times  day (  course   company started  the author)they have both aspartame (nutra-sweet)  partially-hydrogenated vegetable oil ( which  actually talks about  the book  being bad) Therefore  you are going  take nutritional shakes  makes more sense  buy your own   health food store ' cheaper  well  you want  join the 'challenge' you only have  purchase one EAS product

3	 start off  you wish  use this book for Bill' Body-for-Life challenge   not forget  use his products!  You are not eligible unless you   This book  full  inspirational stories has  very doable work-out plan (one that will not consume your life)  will definitely motivate you  help you  realize that you can   control  your life  weight  Bill    tend  disagree  the amount  carbohydrate consumed ( believe that  lower carb diet  truly the key  permanent weight loss) although  may  changing his tune   notice that many  his EAS supplements now come  -carb versions
6	This book has lots  testimonials which are great  you need motivation  However the content  thought was shallow  elementary(what was with all the sappy stories?)  Also the small "healthy" eating chapter (  was just that  "small" chapter) was elementary  boring  Basically  told you  take supplements  make  for the nutrients you aren' getting from the foods  tells you  eat  They consist  veggies  lean meats  Although his information  simple  was not  all impressed  learned nothing that  didn' already know   would not recommend purchasing this book-just use common sense

6	Unbelievable!  This book  the worst piece  propaganda that' out there   couldn' believe the advice  was giving   addition  that the photos looked retouched!!!  Not all the photos were retouched but there are some that have for sure been manipulated '  computer graphics designer   can recognize photos that have been retouched
43	 bought this book about 18 months ago after trying every possible fad diet  the marketAtkins Diet the Zoneyou name  tried   failed!  Seeing the before  after pictures  this book really inspired  along with reading Bill Phillip' motivational style  writing  For  first 12 week challenge  went  GNC  bought the Myoplex shakes  bars  used  few EAS supplements (Betalean  Phen Free)  The cost  these products  sky high   quickly learned  find cheaper protein shake mixes that contained similar ingredients  Personally  think that  the biggest drawback  the book times  slips into infomercial mode for the EAS Company   you are entering the challenge for the prize money then you are required  use EAS products throughout the 12 weeks   you are like  however then you will find that generic brands work just  well ( keep  mind eating REAL food  always better than using the protein shakes but busy schedules sometimes prevent that)This program  best for people who are truly committed  making  difference  their life  Before this book  did not lift weights  One year later  couldn' imagine going  week without hitting the gym  Sticking with the program for 2 12-week challenges left  40 pounds lighter with  entirely new physique   whole different attitude about  health    not for people who want  quick fix for their waistlinebut  you are truly ready  change your life then read this book from cover  cover  take notes!
11	This book  more than just  workout book    not one  read "motivational" type books but this  one area where  felt  needed  improve  life  Boy was  wrong  that thinking  The main thing  take away from this book  that  you set goals  constantly try  achieve them never settling you will always  pleased with your life     week 6   program   have lost most   fat  have  much more defined physique  noted  many friends!   quit smoking cigarettes after 10 years   doing  absolute best  school  Bill has showed  that you get back from life what you put !  The program  simple  follow but ' much harder   honest with yourself  ask "  doing 110%?"  Thank you Bill!
6	For anyone out there that think the before  after photos  this book are fake - THEY ARE NOT!  How   know?    married  one  the champions  saw first hand what  incredible transformation both physically mentally  spiritually Body for Life  Bill Phillips  responsible for  Bill has given everyone the tools  better themselves  every way ' just   you  you choose  take them out  the tool box
3	This book  terrific!!!  ' personally completed the challenge three times  have gotten everything out   that  put into   And for everyone who gets all  tight about his "pushing" his products does  make any sense that  would push the GNC brand?  Come   you' afraid  really put your money where your mouth  just say !

43	 did the whole program  this book  yes  got  great shape  lost weight  felt 100 times better However the people  the photos went from fat  muscular  went from overweight  better shape Not  6 pack  bicep   found  was extremely disappointed  this caused   really feel cheated  think Bills promises  people are unrealistic  wish  would just concentrate  getting people  the best shape  their lives  not having fake pictures  testimonials with the book also  many have noted here - once you are doing this   all about pushing the products that his company sells After comparing several different brands  chose UltraMet  brand  liked much better  would suggest that people take the diet  exercise information from this book Dump the supplements  don' even look  the fake before  after photosBill got his body from steroids -   obvious from the Frankenstein forehead  has  has nerve trying  pretend that  got his body this way  didn' FOR !  But  aware  the lie  well
56	The reviews  this book are amazing   can see most  the positive reviews  this program has worked wonders for   The negative reviews are the worst  First this  not  all protien  carb diet     higher protien than you are probably eating now  lots less carb than you are eating  '  drink  lot more water diet  Supplements -  says take them  save time cooking  preparing meals not that you have  take them   hawks his brand - who cares buy some other brand  that bothers youHis real message  that just  restricting your calorie intake you won' keep the weight off  You will feel hungry  miserable  probably gain  all back  more when you give   the diet   you really want  lose weight you need  build muscle  His program helps you build muscle  lifting weights  Some  these reveiwer seem appalled that  would actually want you  reduce your intake  bad carbs( soda donuts cookies ect) increase your intake  protien  exerciseTime  exercise - the longest workout  46 minutes  Dressing working out  showering takes 65 minute   god  have  miss West Wing   can exercise  some other equally worthless show  The cardio  20 minutes   through completely  35 minutes Everyone has time for this EVERYONELets face   you follow just the exercise portion you will lose fat  What you weigh doesn' matter  Your percentage  body fat should  your concern  Higher protien lower carbs than you are currently eating won' kill you You' been eating low protien high carb  you have gained weight steadily  Could this  any worse than what you are doing now? ' easy  will work
27	 first became aware  this book when  mother purchased    skimmed through   liked what  saw  was very inspired  the before  after photos  presented although  wondered how authentic they were  purchased the book anyway '  [stinker] for  challenge read the book with enthusiasm  ran out  bought the Myoplex meal replacement shakes  These   means are  necessary part  this program but they are recommended   help  quickly achieving your goal   also purchased them from  vitamin store  opposed  the EAS website will say this program  not easy  you must  committed  know almost nothing about diet  exercise   put  life  this man' hands   ate the way  suggested  worked out the way  suggested was slightly overweight when  started  stand 5' 11 ½"  weighed 185 lbs  This weight piled  due   bout with Lyme Disease   goal was  get back  155 lbs  maintainAfter following this program for 10 days  lost 8 lbs Now   sure most  this was water weight  '  lying   said  felt great  actually felt terrible Although  was not hungry  was tired   pain from the exercise regimen  But  did not give The program runs  12-week intervals that  terms `challenges'  One can take  many challenges  they wish until they decide this    lifestyle   the end   first challenge  was down  156 lbs    longer felt tired   pain from the program did not continue  with the challenges instead  adopted  healthier lifestyle  became  vegetarian  This book had much   with wanting  improve  appearance   the way  improved  health must stress that although   not  doctor  think anyone with  chronic illness (such  Fibromyalgia) should check with  doctor before commencing   the time  did not know  mine   was  hard way    Had  known  would have not have attempted this program because  the weight training regimenAll  all  good program  you don' mind wadding through the scientific jargon that  helpful  you understand  albeit difficult  timeshave attempted this program because  the weight training regimenAll  all  good program  you don' mind wadding through the scientific jargon that  helpful  you understand  albeit difficult  times
8	 really got into this book  think ' 1/2 useful book  does say some great things that  all should know  now  LOVE his workout program yet has lot'  limiting factors   like the time  day you can work out  what equipment you should  should not use FOod plan was fairly good   did make  'easy'  eat things think  goes into  faboulous mental aspect  losing weight   very motivational was extremely turned off  the suplimintaion  was 'pushing'  his book  got the impression this book was suppose   'different' even his web pages goes  pages with some questionable products  would recommend anyone checking this book out for some basic ideas  adding   your collection but don' think this  the 'last' book you ever read  ths subject
10	  wanted  read supplement ads ' leaf through the back  fitness magazines  the doctor' office<>That said this book does  good job describing exercises which are simple  targetted  the right muscles   advice - eat  sensible low-fat diet like something your doctor might recommend ( check out Howard Shapiro' books)  concentrate  the exercise section  this book   you' like  (  many others) - you want  lose some weight look  bit better  feel good  That combination ought      may take  little longer but the results will probably last longer since the lifestyle change isn'  radical
52	 bought this book  did  modified version  the program going from 213 lbs  187 lbs  12 weeks without adverse effects  therefore recommend  highly but not without caveatsFirst the science presented  the book  fuzzy   times flat out wrong  not assume that you know anything about metabolic pathways molecular biology  human metabolism after reading this book because you won' Get "Biochemistry"    Mathews   "Molecular Biology  the Cell"Second the book pushes EAS "Myoplex" products   somewhat benign manner  you want  buy these type  packets however avoid the EAS website     general distributor like Netrition  some other  get these types (both EAS  other brands)  shakes more reasonably pricedThird the pictures that come  the book are great for getting you motivated but those that had the greatest transformations did not accomplish them  12 weeks  matter how much they say they did Expect incredible results yes but don' expect   from 250 lbs  45% body fat  180  5% body fat  12 weeks ' not going  happen unless you take "special"  controlled supplements which  don' recommend Like  stated earlier  went from 213 lbs  approx 30 % body fat  187 lbs 105 % body fat  12 weeks while doing  significantly more intense program than that recommended  the book Phenomenal results but   modeling contract yetLastly this  not  diet for those who have specific medical needs  dietary needs such  any metabolic disease renal problems lower back injuries  other issues   SURE  consult your physician before engaging  this diet/exercise programThat being said when you ask your doctor  sure that you doctor  not already prejudiced against high protein diets This diet  higher than average  proteins but   NOT  high protein / low carb diet like Atkins There are several good studies that suggest that  diets comprised  30 - 40 % calories from high grade protein 50 - 60% calories from low glycemic index complex carbohydrates less than 10% calories from fat  extremely low simple sugar content are considerably better than the age old pyramid scheme many   learned  school safer than high protein / low carb diets  more effective  reducing weight  increasing lean muscle mass than high carb / low fat diets  the research yourself  decide what you want    stick with    all means remember that eating too little  never what you want

12	 know 4 people personally that started the program  1 person that finished   they all said  was the best decision they ever made  They look fantastic  they feel like  million bucks!  They' also inspired others  get started   just finished the book    ready  get started!  The people who think '  farce are either quitters cynics  cheaters  Name one exercise program that doesn' cost moneywhen you join  gym  costs money when you set   home gym  costs money  All the proper exercise clothing  apparel costs money  well  <>Bill Phillips does not force anyone  purchase anything from his line  drinks  supplements   only recommends  Each person  free  buy protein drinks  supplements from the local GNC  health food store  The results come from drinking water instead  soft drinks  eating home cooked meals instead  fast food   personally  prefer  home made sandwich over  Big Mac any day  Also realize that buying those jar spaghetti sauces microwave lean cuisine meals  frozen  dinners costs way more money than making home made foods  Has anyone seen the prices  these tiny boxes  instant meals?!  Too much money  Watching  doesn' help either   one gets  shape watching the boob tube   the bottom line  eat healthy home made meals drink lots  water exercise  take supplements  Following Bill' program will guide you NOT dictate you  get  shape

25	The program--like all diet programs--does indeed "work"  the sense that  you follow  you will probably lose some weight  you will get stronger But the book has major problems: 1 This  not  program that people can stay  ' known  dozen   people who went  this diet but who because  the restrictive food program (which  nutritionally utter nonesense)  the expensive supplements couldn' (  fact shouldn') stick with this program Don'  deceived  the testimonials  the book   the Web most people don' have similar experiences2 The program emphases strength  appearance  the risk  good health3 Phillips associates body weight with success  life Absolutely preposterous You   both know dozens  not hundreds  obese men  women who are caring parents successful professionals honorable civic leaders faithful volunteers Phillips seems  demean them all  you have any sense  dignity  honor you' learn  love  appreciate all people even those who are weight challenged4 Phillips promotes the supplement Myoplex for which  profits You should ask yourself why someone would promote  expensive untested supplement rather than promote good nutrition Before you buy Myoplex read the label carefully You' find that you can get the same nutrition   much lower cost  eating  balanced dieting  taking some inexpensive vitamin pills5 Phillips misquotes information  low-fat high-carbohydrate diets His diet  unproven Low-fat high-carbohydrate diets have been proven  improve health  decrease the risk  cardiovascular disease  cancer6 The author' 20-minute 3-day-per-week cardio program should  considered  absolute bare minimum  actual fact research has shown that most people who lose weight  keep  off for  year  more exercise almost daily for 40-60 minutes (mostly walking) what' good about the book? Phillips has done  great job  educating people about the imporance  strength training   regular part  their health  fitness program  think Phillips' weight-lifting (strength-training) program  very good    recommend that you  ahead  get the benefits from the strength training portion  the book omit the Myplex supplement  stick with  healthy nutrition program that emphasises  wide variety  foods rather than risk you health  Phillips' diet

20	Because   profession  read  lot  books like this   can tell you that this   far the WORST book out there  Upon completing this book  was OUTRAGED that any person claiming  want  help people would publish this type  advise  From  nutritionists point  view this book  incredibly misguided   person could suffer serious harm sticking  his recommended diet  This book  just  platform for him sell his shakes powders etc   basically   advertisement    also very condescending towards women preying  their insecurities  There   lot  ' you want    happier  better person  being thin' [stuff] through out the book  STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK  you are planning  helping yourself!  There are much better books out there  help  person exercise more  eat properly   personal favourite  the book  Wini Linguvic  the Body Change program  She offers very sound advise for exercise  nutrition for both men  for women  She  also very motivating  real
52	This book  great for motivation  Having  "free day"  also great  However the program involves too much time  Preparing six nutritious meals per day  exercising six days per week  something that could not fit into  schedule long term   was completely burnt out  the end  the fourth week   felt restricted  the foods (probably because    picky eater)  found his recipes   bland  boring   advocates the use  supplements  the form  shakes  food bars instead  one  two  the six meals  However when  went  the website  thought the supplements were outrageously priced    tried the program without them  found  very difficult  maintain long term  have  busy life   was constantly staying  late  prepare extra meals for the next day  getting  earlier  the morning  fit the exercise into  schedule  This program requires  lot  free time despite what the author says
10	Don' get  wrong  Phillips knows his stuff (how  motivate those who  not live  healthy lifestyle how  write   way that  easy for the average reader  understand  how  sell his supplements/magazine) but what  you are all ready  shape?  wanted  incorportate  Phillips' advice  themes into  routine  give   jumpstart   bought this book  However after applying BodyforLife into  own life  physique actually declined! His theory  intensity simply did not increase  muscle  strength<>This   very educational book  entails all  the BASIC fundementals   healthy lifestyle  you want  get into shape  discover that hidden 6 pack this book will get you HEADED  the right direction However  you are  avid lifter  enjoy  healthy lifestyle then ' sorry pal this book  not for you
4	The book  easy  read  contains  simple common sense approach  overall fitness  nutrition  The book goes  little over the top  the inspiration side but generally the book  detailed  specific  contains useful information   tried the 12 week challenge presented  the book  experienced tremendous results  have seen the same happen  others who tried    would recommend this book  anyone who feels like they are   fitness  nutrition rut  need  kick start
9	When  started this program  was convinced  too could    12 weeks!  With 2 boys  husband  other obligations  soon found that maybe  was going  take 12 months  That'  though!    called Body for LIFE!!   have been  this lifestyle for 7 months now   have come about halfway   goal  Others usually men seem  get  their goals faster but for this stay--home mom   just glad  have  plan  follow for  exercise  eating  The web site helps  lot too  you need extra inspiration  This book  well worth its price  you just need something  get you started  your weight loss program
5	This should   book everyone reads who even "thinks" about going   diet  diet alone affects only your physical size  has some positive affect  the person mentally - but -dieting plus exercise allows the person  experience  win-win-win situation  /she wins with the weight loss wins with  stronger body plus wins mentally  This book   excellent motivator    exercise program (regardless  intensity)  maintained along with proper nutrition for 12 weeks  should become  life-changing habit  that amount  time
20	 bought BodyforLIFE for  54 year old puffy out  shape husband because  was worried about his health but  course  left the book   countertop   would think  was for !  read the whole book that night  now three weeks later has lost  inch  fat from his 36 inch waist bought  weight bench  free weights resumed using our Nordictrak ski machine entered the book' BodyforLIFE challenge kept  BFL food  exercise journal  even resumed  bedroom remodeling project  had put off for months because  his lack  energy All  three weeks!

10	 started off really excited about this book worked with  lady  Inside Edition  the time  she followed this book  the letter  really got  into <> wasn'  keen  taking the before pictures   didn' don' own  scalebut  used  high school prom dress   measuring stick<>  honest the book was difficult  followgoing  the gym 5 days  week was killing  though  was for short periods  timefor myself  was very difficult  maintain That   problem thoughworking full time  going  college full time  was really wearing  down<>The other factor was that  was not used  eating 6 times  day  upon pricing the EAS food supplements that were recommeded  about died Instead  went  Costco  purchased  box  MetRx shakes  used those instead  they worked great<> did this program for 6 weeks  never finished the 12 weeks due  some circumstances   life But  will say this lost  lot  weight!  was able  put  prom dress back  with room  spare!<>' been about  year since  started that program   intend   back   after Superbowl this year (for obvious reasons)  have  say though  have gained some weight backnot all   though which most likely  due   eating habits<>For myself the biggest problem  had was remembering  eat 6 times  daybeing  college  working food just doesn' come  mind until ' nearly time for bed One can work around the time spent  the gym ' recommended you   the morningsbut  night  okay too<>Wish  luck!  will  starting this program again Feb 4th! However this time  will measure myself' still against the before  after pictures won' let anyone take them  ! LOL but  will weigh  measure myself this time  ' try  remember  report back!
13	This book contains some useful information   don' follow the program strictly but  has helped  structure  weight training   really like the idea  decreasing  reps  increasing  resistance with every set   exerciseThe real problem with this book  the quality  the writing    one  the most poorly written books  have ever read  Reading this book  like being trapped  the room with  hyper-enthusiastic salesman who just keeps giving you same pitch over  over  over   was definitely written for people who haven' picked   book since sophomore year  high school
22	Bottom line this works!  have been  this life change for only three weeks now    having dramatic results (lost 9 lbs  far  pants fit better    getting stronger) The whole concept  6 meals  day every 2-1/2 hours with exercise 6 days  week  you think that you won' have time for all that exercise remember the weight training days are only 45 minutes  the cardio days are only 20 minutes   not spending any money  any  the supplements  only eat food   easy for   cook one night  eat the leftovers for two   meals the next day combined with  egg omelet  the morning after  work out   bowl  oatmeal  night  only need  find two other meals  complete  day   actually saving money cause  are not eating out twice  day The thing that  keeping  true  this  the cheat day Once  week  eat whatever  want  don' know what this does but man  sure does help  would have given this 5 stars  fact  give the program 5 stars  the book 4 stars The problem  the same with any other health/diet/fitness book  only takes about 5 pages  describe  detail the plan  this diet Why make  into  [] book  for some  the other reviewers that say their weight came back remember this   life style change  you  back  eating  pizza every night you are going  gain  back this however holds true for any diet  not just this one

57	 read the book  completed  12-week challenge   was not terribly overweight but  did manage  lose over 15 pounds  drop  bodyfat from 18%  6%  the end   12 weeks   bulked   muscles gained strength lost inches  pounds  built  physique  was quite proud that was about 8 months ago  Now ' gained back the weight ( waistline)  apart from the bigger muscles  pretty much back where  started from  That brings    point: this program does produce results but   very difficult  maintain over  long period  time   think the main reason why  because you really have  push yourself  the max  the gym every time  while you get  great sense  accomplishment your mind also wears down  Going  the gym for 5 days out  the week albeit for short 45 (weights)  20 minute (aerobics) sessions can  hard  maintain  Also  found eating 6 small meals  day was difficult because  was not practical  far  the time spent preparing meals  working  into your schedule  well  the additional cost for food    other point  that you have    little creative  constantly find ways  work the program into your life because  does require compromise planning  lots  effort  Another note: this program can  hard  your wallet!!  Even with  gold card  GNC  found myself spending  lot  money  protein shakes creatine  such ( course the book pushes EAS products)  The bottom line  that this program does produce results  you' willing  work very hard    Also you will have  make  significant change  your lifestyle   can  expensive too   you can maintain this intensity for life then all the power  you  ' going  start  low insulin eating program &quotsugar busting&quot  reqular exercise for good health that  can maintain for  lifetime

20	 started working  this program 2 months back  have seen results that exceeded  goals The great thing about this program ( the book)  that  provides you with data sheets that you can use  keep track  your progress The other interesting fact  the way Bill recommends doing your exercisesstarting with  level 5  going all the way upto 10  have been going  the gym for 3 years now  have not seen any other technique work  well  believe that this technique would work well for ppl  all sizes  shapes  that  you are sincere for 3 months you will (guaranteed) see results  entered 4 stars coz' most  not all the information  the book   Bill' website  you really dont need the book Additionally you can download the fact sheets etc also for the website ' nice  keep the book but  not really required

6	 had been trying  lose weight for years   guess  was neither serious enough      own   just hadn' found the right &quotformula&quot   bought Body For Life  read part   got all inspired took some &quotbefore&quot pictures then  didn' exercise forgot about  pictures  left the book   nightstand few months later though  read the entire book  decided  follow Bill Phillip' 12 week plan  Guess what?   WORKED!  Although  probably already knew most  the information given  the book  was laid out  such  way that  thinking was required  The pictures  the book also gave   dose  willpower that  had been lacking   3 months  went from 210 lbs  168 lbs  loss  42 lbs!  People  had not seen  months told   was difficult  recognize    waist decreased 5 inches  even  neck decreased  inch   half was truly  life changing event  Although  did not enter the &quotChallenge&quot this book really made  feel like  winner
51	Bill Phillips  quite  salesman But this book  very short  nutrition  completely ignores the common side effects   high protein diet which can wreak havoc with the digestive tract The book gives  800 number for diet counseling but the counselors are similarly lacking knowledge  basic nutrition  understanding  metabolism Phillips provides numerous testimonials from his &quotchampions&quot yet admits every one  them uses the supplements his company sells Those supplements are mentioned throughout the book   taken  recommended would cost the dieter over three hundred dollars per month  suspect this  what the program  all about
14	Even though  have only been  the program  the book for  few weeks  have lost weight   feel better physically  mentally already  And  crazy chocolate cravings have totally disappeared   fact when someone brought   box  Ethel  chocolates today  work  initially thought "    going  ruin  eating habits today"   did eat one however one was enough  Since  have been eating  healthy the chocolate seemed too sweet   didn' want another one    that   miracle!   have always tried  tried  eat healthy but    anywhere near chocolate  can' help myself  always sabotage  healthy eating  All  all Body For Life   great program  follow would also like  mention that  began  similiar program 2 years ago   book  Larry North called "Slimdown For Life" (which also has glowing reviews)  Larry North' program  almost identical  this one except you eat 5 times  day  you don' exercise  hard   think  mix between this  Body for Life   good balance for   Also Larry North' book has  LOT  recipes that will fit  the Body for Life plan  give this book 4 stars instead  5 because  believe Bill could have included more meal planning examples  there are  recipes (you have    his website for recipes)  And also because even though  says all you need are dumbbells some  the exercises use different machines final note  the individuals who claim Bill  only trying  sell his EAS products - give   break -  only talks about the advantage  using them  1   half pages  that     have found that these products help   great deal since   very busy  they enable   stay  the program without giving   giving  because  don' feel like cooking

Using fake pictures  illustrate the &quotbefore-after&quot differences does not help  make  credible either Are  really suppossed  believe that all  these are real??!! And though  can accept that people  benefit from  simply  exercising  watching their diet the sales talk through out the book  just silly   not see myself getting   life habit  writing down  feelings after  had  snack ( illustrated  the book  keeping  daily diary 'just had  snack -  really feel great not hungry  all!!' - owh goodie!) just  keep motivated   have  change  life!  beginner' program should focus  small muscles groups that would increase strenght (one legged squat/deadlift etc) with plenty  stretching building   reach  high fitness level (  not say &quotbulk &quot)  you want  acheive this goal: ultimate fitness  suggest you buy &quotMaximum Fitness&quot  Stewart Smith Sorry folks: this   52 week program  hard work  sweat But being fit  becoming fit  just not that easy Obtaining the results shown  the pictures  three months time:   physically impossible!

15	This book  simply      times inspirational  does contain  few nuggets  information but for the most part the program  unrealistic   was  impression that the types  food  exercise methods are not the most practical for your average person--speaking not  intensity but  availability    simply too complicated read this book  year ago  didn' follow   Since that time  have joined  gym  simply worked hard  ate right  ' seen the same results that the followers  this program claimSave your money

18	' read just about every diet book  the market  read about the studies they are based   you want  get your body into shape this book  about  good  you can possibly getFirst   SIMPLE Really easy  follow The principles used here are pretty basic well-accepted  other people have written about them -- but Bill Phillips has put them together   program that you can follow without devoting your entire life  'health' You don' need  buy much  anything except the bookSecond  WORKS  found out about  from  woman who made  rather amazing transformation --  she was  really busy housewife with minimal interest  'dieting'  'health' The principles here like  said have been written about quite  bit Bill doesn'  into the science behind the program much: presumably  has  his other articles  magazine but ' read them elsewhere ' not gimmicky  hocus-pocus: basically  you eat moderate portions  the right kind  foods your calorie count will  pretty moderate  the flow  sugar into your bloodstream will  steady Combine that with  good dose  (short hard) excercise  your body gets  shape real fastThe diet part includes protein  carbohydrate with each meal There  more protein than some folks would recommend but certainly not enough  put you into 'ketosis' But like the Atkins Zone  other people have found out  good dose  protein does wonders  keeping you appetite under control  while some folks would say you don' need that much protein   certainly less harmful than any appetite suppressant Also   LEAN protein  you aren' clogging your arteries And the body builders  say  adds muscle fasterThe carbs are mainly the slower-digesting kind (brown rice potatoes pasta)which also helps your appetite  your glycemic factor -- eating 6 times  day helps too The drinks are optional but they taste good  arevery convenient ( carry them when  leave the house  case  can' find anything decent  eat) The nutritional information might not seem very scientific -- ' too simple -- but  did figure out  actual caloric/fat/protein intake based  the program   was   good range You can eat like this the rest  you life  all you will get  healthy Enough   favorite foods are included that ' easy  stick The one day off  week  pure genius though That' where you get what WON' fit  the guidelines (like chocolate chip cookies)And the excercise -- well this ain' the ' sweat' kind  program The excercise  very much  part   but ' managable (even for  programming geek) After  week  good hard machine-weight training though  feel better than  have for  long time!All  all you won' find  better program among the books out there You can  more reading  find out more  the science  you can count calories  you want: but  you follow this program you WILL get  shape without doing anything else

18	 had wanted  review this book before but decided  wait until  completed  first 12 week challenge  This book was really  life-changer for   After years  spending  average  1 1/2 - 2 hours  day six days  week  the gym  seeing little   results (performing  average  70-80 minutes  cardio each time  some unfocused weight training)  was skeptical  first  Bill Phillips' claims that performing 20 minutes  cardio three times  week plus three weight-training workouts  less than  hour each  week would give  any measurable results - but they have!     this point though  must correct some errors made  earlier reviews - first off Myoplex  only  convenience - not required  There are other meal replacements out there that work -  you can choose not  use them  all  And shop around for the best price   The only other supplement  recommends  name  Betagen but you don' even HAVE  supplement  all -  would recommend multi-vitamins  the very least (generic versions from your local drugstore)  Brett Sharpe below states that Bill Phillips recommends four Myoplex shakes  day when  fact  recommends that  least THREE  your SIX meals consist  'whole foods'   myself use 2 Myoplex Lites  day  average you can' afford boneless skinless chicken breasts you' looking  the wrong aisle  your supermarket  Try the frozen-food section - most groceries now sell the big bags  IQF chicken breasts   And bread  authorized (albeit reluctantly)   myself  not eat bread unless '  Free Day ( great part  the program  the way!)  And about eating before you exercise -  your goal   burn bodyfat you should exercise   EMPTY stomach All  all  great program that ' recommend  anyone!  Looking forward   second challenge starting  Monday!
15	  perused this book  kept thinking  myself:   REALLY want  look like these guys? Actually the answer  probably yes but  all seemed  bit silly Take for  the "Before/After" pics pasted  the inside  the cover  around the book   neat little photo strip They' amazing but the men have laughably shaved the hair off their chest  belly  slathered Vaseline over themselves  they look  plastic  -Man action figures They all have perfect dental teeth  blow-dry hair under better lighting Open the book  the text has  simplistic breezy infomercial style with lots  "life-stories"-style  phrases that you can find  Reader' Digest All the feel-good philosophy behind the inspirational stories scream "Oprah!" The people  the pics would probably say ' jealous Well actually they probably  feel better than  They' certainly  better shape sarcastic thoughts kept coming    flipped through the book trying  find reasons  not like  Sigh But  hafta admit: '  really good solid book one that  not bad  have even  you never lift  finger The advice  practical even insightful   was impressed with some  the ideas While the inspirational stuff sometimes tends    the cheesy side the author   sincere  straightforward (for  donating funds  the Make--Wish Foundation  offering his $200000 Lamborghini Diablo  the reward   competition) that you can' help but like him even trust him  buy this book Why   say this? Because  the end despite  complaints ' still  fat slob  Bill Phillips  not the way: The only thing  that  don' think  will   repeat the cadence out loud  "  building  Body-for-Life!" while lifting dumbbells Sorry but that'  par with the girls  Judy Blume' "Are You There God? '  Margaret" who chant " must- must-Increase our bust!" Other than that this  probably one  themost straightforward  practical books ' read  fitness ' worth 
1	 think  philips has come  with  mnagable program for people who don' have alot  tme  their hands  helps you  eat better  get results However  disagree with  bread  nutrition Whole wheat  the morning with  little peanut butter tastes great Also eat befor you exercise!

Then add  the other supplements  you' got quite  hefty bill there  cannot afford all the chickenbreasts for meals   especially cannot afford  spend $50  week  protein shakes  Give     you want  change You will definately feel big accomplishments However you may end  altering some  his &quotnutrition plans&quot  fit your budget  only drink Myoplex after workouts
16	This book touched   such  important way Bill Phillips talks  one point about how people shut down over time  why  thinks this occurs  brought   tears because ' exactly how  felt about myself That  was shutting down that  was slowly but surely losing  interest  life  everything And  body was starting  look like  read the book  have been doing the Body-for-Life exercise  diet program for about 6 weeks (half way through  first &quotchallenge&quot  they' called) ' lost 12 pounds  taken 25 inches off  middle -- already better than half way   goals '  wonderful program  ' the first time ' done any kind  program that  honest have felt  could  forever Generally ' always been looking forward   being &quotover&quot -- but that' the whole idea behind Body-for-Life: ' never overEven  you decide not   the Body-for-Life program itself (  rigorous!) the book  inspirational  definitely worth reading

3	Nutrition  exercise are essencial  good health  Everyone knows that  How often  you recieve good information  either subject though?  Hardly ever   opinion Count the number  times you see   for either junk food (resturants fast food  snack food)  the number  times you see   for  miracle cure (some '' machine  some fat reducing cream  some electronic muscle stimulator for example) then compare that  the number  times you see something positive about health  exercise that doesn' promise  miracle cureThe program  Body for Life  HARD   got though 7 weeks    had great results    going back  track   tells you most  what you need  know  However  doesn' have  section  flexibility ( major ommition  hope  fixed   later edition)   does tell you  lot about nutrition   lot about exercise   tells you  lot about what you need    succeed  The people who complete the challenge  are transformed are few  number -  isn' easy  get that kind  transformation  the only way  get     transform your life  work hardThe single best thing about the book  the philosophy that can  found  each pageCan you  the program without EAS products?

3	One can admire Bill Phillips for one thing   can make exercise sound fun even though  all know  isn'  The book  about 90% inspirational text  10% practical information  The exercise regimen  very extreme  scope  depth   would not recommend anyone who  obese  suddenly stop eating     olympic-style workout plan for over 3 months    avid fitness  weight training enthusiast  can understand the intent but unless you are already somewhat fit prepare  succumb  either injury  simply fail the program  some point   read the book from cover  cover but did not  through with the 12-week program    merely doing what  have always done   satisfied with   Healthful diet weights cardio work with good rest days  between  Consistency  the key here  Twelve weeks  simply not long enough  attain such lofty goals  Body for &quotLIFE&quot should  the kicker hereonce you quit  fit lifestyle  prepared  watch your gains disappear little  little  you reach for the second helping  3-cheese lasagna  italian sausage
30	  46 years old  have tried various exercise programs for 25 years This  the first program that  have stuck  for more than 3 months The concept  20 minutes  intense aerobics 3 times  week  weight training for 45 minutes 3 times  week was not overwhelming because 20 minutes  45 minutes  realistic  didn'  the dietary supplements  protein stuff  followed the basic diet principles  6 small meals  day  lots  water  didn' cheat with junk food  deserts except  Sunday like  allowed  was also able  stick  this saw results right away which was encouraging  exceeded  goals  the end  the 12 weeks  dropped from 190  20% body fat  165  13% body fat  have stayed  the exercise program for  year now  really has changed  life  wouldn' miss  day for anything!!  metabolism  such that  pretty much eat what  want except that  have eliminated junk food from  diet recommend the book  the program The exercise  intense but  doesn' last long  that was the key for  The free eat day  Sunday gave  something  look forward   kept  from feeling deprived
7	   good book with some good information The stories are inspirational but  lakes  full spectrum approach  the topic  know many people swear  the book  the program but having read the book  done the &quotChallenge&quot  can speak from experience   lacks   not think there   sentence  stretching  going from overweight  working out 6 days  week  using between 3  6 different supplements requires more   book than this  This  just  opinion  know many people have achieved great things with    congratulate them
5	 mentioned  another review the nutrition advice was lacking  say the least  found this book had very good advice  weight training but  follow this program  difficult especially  you' going    for the rest  your life  also find that   woman  need more cardio work Although the pictures show successful women '  willing  bet  works better with  man' body' stick with jogging -  works better for 
3	This book contains basic information  weightlifting exercising  healthy eating  ' not rocket science  One thing this book does give which  hard  find elsewhere  the inspiration needed  actually start  fitness program like this  ' changed  life  ' lost 20 pounds  4 inches off  gut  the last 12 weeks   look  feel great  And  know  can keep  off because the program  simple  easy
4	 was looking for  good weight training book  found this one much too complicated  time consuming  Basically you  about six sets  each weight  The routine took over 45 minutes  wasn' very fun  Fortunately  have  own equipment   can' imagine doing this   health club with people waiting for the machines
16	 too  skeptical  the pictures  the jacket  the book but   states 25 lbs   safe amount  weight  lose Many  the people shown did not have much more than 25 lbs  lose   not expecting  body  look like the pictures   impossible  unsafe Also unrealistic These people are not   have 55 pounds  lose  body  not shaped like theirs Therefore  will have its own unique successes After reading the book  believe that most  his concepts are viable His exercise techniques are safe  the diet  not restricted (NEVER trust  restrictive diet!)  have been doing what everyone else tries long hard cardio  weight lifting sessions for three years  tightened  but not much more What have  got  lose?

19	' admit right now that  haven' read this book  ' looked through   ' read all the website' info which many assure   the sameHow can  have the tenacity  write  review from such  shakey position?  Because  find some  the things this book  saying worrying  The level  information provided clearly marks this book out   introduction  fitness    all for anything that will get people started  the path  health but just  the transition from couch potato  gym-rat  the most rewarding   also the most dangerous   you get your head filled with the wrong ideas then you' struggle ever  extricate them  Bill Phillips puts the success  his program down  the time limit  12 weeks  Now that  just under 3 months  Looking  the pictures  the people who have supposedly changed  that length  time raises severe concerns    You just cannot cause some  those transformations  that length  time   least not  doing   healthy way  People start off looking like whales  come out looking like pro bodybuilders - they' gained pounds  muscle  lost reams  fat  &quotSurely&quot you say &quotthat  possible  see people  magazines that have massive musculature but  bodyfat&quot   but here' the rub  Those people have achieved that over  period  years each year split into two seasons: the off-  the competition season   the former they eat like pigs  bulk   the latter they diet like crazy  get the &quotripped&quot look they  desire    the precious few (John Ramone  well regarded bodybuilder admitted  only ever having met one) who can stay lean  get bigger all year roundRemember  are talking years here  You can change your body  months but there   limit that only drugs are going  breach   believe that many  the before  after photos are either the products  image doctoring  steroids  weightlifter   always one  extoll the virtues  weights especially for women who are often worried they will look like  Eastern bloc athlete  However  don' like the way aerobics seems   sidelined  this program   you have  pick between weights  aerobics choose the latter  Lifting will make you have  great exterior but studies have shown that your interior thanks you much more for aerobics   think programs like this tend  use aerobics merely   fat burning process rather than heart enhancement  Their reason: the public only pays for results  can see   these programs tend  pass off  very image-concious rather than health-concious view  fitnessAll  all  gave this book two stars because   provides people with the impetus  work-out then that can only   positive thing  However using false idols  &quotexamples&quot  the programme  pretending that  truly provides  holistic type  health prevents this book from  true support

84	Well  give props  Bill for being something   fitness guru  has managed  get himself into shape  inspire others  follow his lead However  beef stems from the misleading suggestion that his book offers any advice that differs from that which can  found for free  his web site After dishing out [the money] expected  become privy  information not  readily available  the net Once again  was mistaken Now that  not  say anger pulses through  veins  this point This review   word  the wise Follow the man' advice Just follow  for free from his web site
74	 did the 12 week Body for Life program  the last 3 months  last year  Just followed the regimen  the book  Results were incredible (enough  that  now believe the pictures are for real  You can seem mine  many others  leanandstrongcom)   waist size went from 38&quot  32&quot  And unlike conventional dieting  was never hungryThis book    sense  con job   does minimally push EAS products but ' easy  find substitutes for them (typically much cheaper)    the program without them ( still use nutritional shakes bars  some supplements but shop for price now) give the program 5 stars the book 4 stars    think Bill Phillips could spend less time  motivational rhetoric  more time explaining the quite sound scientific foundation for the program   gained  great deal from the explanation  []  There'  tremendous community  support  advice available given the tens  thousands who have done the program for this year  ' basically just continuing the regimen with  little more flexibility given the fact that ' met  goals (actually now the 32&quot waist pants  bought  December are getting pretty loose!)  Experiencing the fact that  works   actually enjoyable makes  easy  integrate  into your life

23	And tell everyone you know about Body for Life  Recent news reports indicate what  obvious  anyone strolling the mall--Americans are seriously out  shape  dangerously overweight   wife   read this amazing book  started the regimen  Jan 1 2001 (this was not  New Year' resolution but  lifestyle choice) Bill Phillips presents detailed information about resistance training aerobics  nutrition   way that either the novice  the &quotgym rat&quot can relate    learn  maximize time working out  keep records using forms provided  how  make detailed plans for our diet  our workout routine The components  the book are well presented understandable  forcefully appeal  logic  common sense While some may criticize the promotion  Phillips' supplement products you can eat right  train effectively without using them (there are also plenty  competing alternatives  Phillips actually devotes very little time  discussing his products)  Given the plethora  fad diets   steady stream  &quot&quot devices being hawked  cable    hard  find something that not only educates but motivates The latter aspect  the real key  this book' success  The inspirational tenor  the book  truly uplifting  constitutes its &quothigh point&quot    Even  the egocentric reader quibbles with some  Phillips' conclusions  one can argue with the fact that Phillips'overall admonitions are true  Work out eat right  feel great  This book  transforming bodies  lives  Health  more important than money  Bill Phillips makes millions off supplements let'  grateful that   being rewarded for his dedication  capitalism  good health  This nation needs  wake- call  Bill Phillips' book provides sound advice  guidance for those who want  overcome destructive habits  Readers  this book who elect not  eat right  exercise are decaying  dying  choice  The testimonials  the before  after photographs  people who committed  changing their lives demonstrates that Phillips knows what ' talking about Most importantly  challenges   get with the program   way that works    Read this book-- could save your life
34	 bought this book  the advice  one   aunts  She told  how this had been  great for one  neighbors   read the book  one day '  very quick  easy read but the thing that jumped out   immediately Bill Phillips NOT ONCE mentions his credentials where did nhe   school what  his degree  searched his websites his articles his interviews  mention  all!  When asked about himself  says what  great day   where  lives  what  wonderful workout  had that day  never mentions which doctors  any have supervised this program  that this diet has any medical  scientific basis whatsoeverSome  what  says  very reasonable you need  make the choice  get healthy but  never cites the &quotstudies&quot further than saying &quot  research&quot  &quot studies&quot  Where were these studies when who conducted them?  Second  that the photos are quite obviously doctored for example one woman  his book seemingly lost not only ALOT  weight   short time but lost about 6 inches  her height  became Asian  Another example-  gentleman from New Zealand with  hand deformity has seemingly been cured  that deformity  his neck grew  nearly  foot  Another man  said    teacher  the book but ont  website  insurance salesman  Minor observations but  think they lead  the credibility  the diet

1	This book  for people that need  push   especially designed for people that are just beginning  get into shape / struggling  get the perfect shape The book  very very easy  read  doesn' have any mumbo jumbo hard  comprehend words  did not agree with some aspects such  not eating before working out  also the fact that you have  work out more than one body part per session
20	While some people have  problem with Bill Phillips making money off his program (  Richard Simmons  Jane Fonda gives theirs away for free) this book  basic enough for someone interested  getting  shape The first half  the book  mostly motivational but isn' that the reason most people quit  diet  fitness plan?   The plan DOES work  you follow   the letter  know because  worked for    wife  The supplements are pricey but can  purchased  gyms  fitness stores locally   more reasonable price  course common sense will tell you that one plan does not fit all  some people will react negatively  any plan  some people need more carbs   daily basis than others others might have  reaction   certain chemical  supplement But  blame the plan for  reaction  allergy  like blaming nature for  allergy  pollen While  natural protein  carb  always better than  supplement the supplements are handy for those days when you are  the  Yes the book  basic but who wants  get involved with  complicated plan?   you buy the book  sign  for the challenge  recieve the free videos  could easily  the best $ you have spent   long time The support hotline  great  free    wealth  knowledge Like any plan common sense goes  long way But  you are looking for  basic plan that does work  gives results there   better value than this book
15	 found the overall approach outlined  this book   exactly what  wife   were looking for  age 67  can' find many books that address the issues that   concerned with building slowly from pretty poor physical shape after decades  neglect working out  home rather than   gym  using low-cost equipment After the first 12 weeks  are both  our plan  looking forward  the next 12 week program  now regularly jog for  few minutes  day  the beach  proudly display our dumbbells  ankle weights The pictures  the book show exactly what    what not    there are enough alternatives that  can select the exercises that fit our fitness level  borrowed this book from  friend  will pass    another friend now that  have absorbed its message

10	' been obese most   life  have tried  number  things but &quotBody-for-Life&quot  the program that finally clicked ' just finished  first 12-week Challenge   very pleased despite facing  number  obstacles  fact  think the program helped  face those barriers This  NOT  short-term fix but  lifestyle roadmap Now  plan  12-week segments for  exercise  nutrition plans Now  set short-term goals  reach the long-term vision  have for  life The structure that &quotBody-for-Life&quot provides will  the answer for many people who have failed  plan The planning DOES pay off  Bill Phillips has written  great book

131	Most  this book  motivational which  find useless because Bill  suggesting that what works for his mind should work for everybody Clinical social workers would  out  business  mindset were that simple And then just  few pages  the book are dedicated   very rudimentary ( rather good) introduction  bodybuilding technique such   have seen  many bodybuilding magazines usually under the title &quotBodybuilding 101&quot  something All too often  see somebody who follows this book   afraid  experiment  any way For some people  3:1 ratio  carbs  protein  best  for some people  1:3 ratio  best Phillips takes the conservative middle route  suggesting 1:1  the few who grace the championship pictures are probably those who like Bill are best suited  this ratio Also the book does not mention how much fat  person should consume  many assume that fat intake should   low  possible This  not  all true Fat intake should  around 15  35%  calories depending  who you are  should come from the healthy fats such  nuts avocadoes olive oil fish oil  cetera The only kind  fat  avoid  hydrogenated fat  fat that  damaged  some other way such  that from homogenized dairy products  suggest that people accept that not all bodies are the same  make  your intellectual endeavor  design  program for your own body which will probably take more than twelve weeks   but fortunately you have more than twelve weeks This book   great starting point Bill  from  experience pretty much right  about eating frequent small meals never eating carbs without protein  slow down the glycemic response getting the essential fatty acids how often  when  exercise how   cardio  training for women  don' like the way this book doesn' even try  explain the science behind the ideas the way many other books    Bill  assuming the reader might not understand  Also his program suggests  &quotfree day&quot The free day can  good for you  bad for you depending  what you  during   that day you must raise your metabolism  oversaturate the muscular repair process  the free day  not decrease the frequency  your meals only increase the portion sizes  stick  healthy foods Don' kid yourself about this free day Margarine eaten  the free day will damage your heart just like  any other day   absolute binge fest will cause you  put  fat       refine the technique for yourself  suggest that you get && Practical Approach  Strength Training&&  Matt Brzycki  ignore his advice about diet  about machines being just  good  free weights--they aren' But his advice involves fewer sets  more intensity than the Body for Life book   think   better And for refining your diet the two best books  have seen are &&The Schwarzbein Principle&&  Diana Schwarzbein which gives  very good explanation  insulin management  discerning healthy from unhealthy ingredients Also perhaps the best book  individualized diet  &quotEat Right for your Type&quot  Peter  'Adamo which  usually for the most part correct  will help you determine what foods  eat And  general  reduction  carbohydrates  the best way  tip the balance toward losing fat  the severity  this should depend  your body type        advice  supplements  that vitamins  minerals creatine monohydrate HMB  -Glutamine will help you but you can get them for much cheaper than what EAS charges  The myoplex shakes are good for some people bad for others They contain small amounts  hydrogenated oil which should  avoided  anyone But for some people whey protein powder  very beneficial  muscle building   you are one  those people  suggest that you buy eleven pounds   for $5000 from wwwsupplementdirectcom  save  ton  money  then eat grapes  apples  something with your protein powder  get carbs     The original EAS physique transformation challenges left the participant  design his  her own program   think this  the best approach The most dramatic before/after photos actually come from the original contest not the contests where people follow the Body for Life program back when the programs were not forced into  &quotone size fits all&quot structure  guy  there named Everett Herbert went   diet that had 300 grams  protein per day  100 grams  carbs per day   worked wonders for him  skinny guy named Anthony Ellis while putting  muscle omitted cardiovascular exercise  maximize his muscle gains Don'  afraid  experimenting Muscle Media magazine published  Bill Phillips  probably the best source  these little tips but lately  has started  become mostly motivational Whenever somebody tells Bill Phillips that they aren' losing  much fat  they should  his program  busts out the line that &quotthis  not about having  perfect body ' about LIFE&quot  suggests that they  the same thing they' been doing  inevitably get the same results they' been getting Don'  afraid  experiment with foods  training   not fall victim  ANYBODY' &quotone size fits all&quot approach And  course  consider getting  shape one  the greatest things you can  for yourself For motivation just think &quot could starve myself for  week   had &quot ( you can)  then sticking  any plan that includes food seems easy Good Luck!!

89	 have read many books  fitness  have worked out   off for about 30 years  ' not new  this  What really convinced  that this book   program was different were the testimonials  before  after photos  (some are literally unbelievable)   real bonus  his program does not  require  huge exercise time investment - only about 4 hours per week   And  definitely appreciated that his program could  done  home with  minimal equipment (Fortunately  already owned  good treadmill   weights  this part was easy) Therefore  wife   bought  read  the book   convinced  wife  participate  the program along with   (she  definitely not  fitness buff!)

Yes!    can already see the changes  our bodies for the better  our  metabolisms are really revved  just like  says will occur   have  been working the program for about 4 weeks although  modified some   the guidelines  make  fit our needs  lifestyles Overall  think  this   excellent book  program  would rate  the book   program &quot4 ½ stars&quot  However   not perfect   some  respects his book  program &quotmisses the boat&quot  For example  his workout regimen  diets are not modified  accommodate males   females young  old fit  unfit   does not give any good examples  for women  their 50s  older  One standard program does Not work for  all   Unfortunately  does not tell the reader what   once their  goal  reached   doesn' say what  good &quotmaintenance  program&quot would Another weak point  the lack  exercises for  the thighs abs  butt   are supplementing his program with some   Denise Austin' exercise tapes  (She'  great motivator!)  Further  his diets  not provide for enough servings  fruits  vegetables -   really should  eating  least five  six per day  Finally  youneed   buy his shakes?    course not  Other brands should  fine   eat low-fat cottage cheese  carrot sticks  Makes  great snack!   use  protein bars because our jobs  not easily allow mixing shakes   workHaving said all this still  get the book  work the program   you are serious about getting  shape  You can always modify   suit  your individual needs  ' fairly tough  rigorous actually some parts  are fairly rigid but   said you can vary the exercises diet timing  etc  accommodate your needs   this  designed   intensive  program expect  expend substantial effort   does provide excellent  motivation both mental  physical  His exercise examples  selection  are very good  And  dispels quite  few myths about diet  exercise   Basically using this book  like having your own highly skilled personal  trainer with you whenever you want

5	This book covers everything  beginner needs  know  provides lot  information about simple effective exercises   little complicated  &quotmilk shake&quot diet But  you are  &quotMuscle Media&quot  magazine subscribers like   you will find all the information  the  book come from the magazine Also  you already know body building   weight training You won' find the book useful
8	This book seems  amazing until you start reading the whole program Bill Phillips RECOMMENDS using the Myoplex supplement but '   nutritional supplement that costs  lot  money Anyone could achieve the  same results with another training program using  similar nutritional  supplement
162	Let'  honest  Every one   wants  look like somebody else  But seasons  failed programs both diet  exercise regimens have convinced  most   that ' never  -- ' never hang   whatever  meager results  get    like most  you will approached this  book  program with  healthy dose  skepticism--which was about the  only healthy thing left   life after thirty years    alternating  between overeating  starving myself between laying around all day   frenetic exercise activity which wore  outOne thing made    believer encountering  guy   home town who had won  grand prize    result  just twelve weeks  working the Body for Life regimen     tried   And here' what  did for Transformed  cholesterol  level  eight weeks from 200  133  Changed  body fat level  eight  weeks from about 24%  145%  Gave   exercise program that  safe  not time-consuming  that can  done  home with minimal equipment   And that exercise program has given   body that  materially different  from the one  started withYeh  know  All ' talked about  the  plan--not the book  But the book  the plan  the plan  the book   The book  well-written for the most part ( few too many &quotyou  see&quot phrases  there for )The exercise illustrations  the  &quottips&quot are absolutely excellent  Worth the price  the book   themselves  The stories  the changed lives are good too though they all  begin  sound alike after awhile  Read them  you' find yourself   there somewhere great read  simple program (though certainly not  easy)  tremendous results are  store for everyone who picks  the  book picks  themselves  picks  the weights  gets  work
16	This book looks like  great strategy for achieving  great body the easiest way   succesful  find out how someone else has done something   copy  After reading the reviews (before purchasing the book)   imagined this book   50% improving body  50% selling the EAS product  line  read the book  was dissapointed   98% improving body  2%  mentioning the product line   starting this program (08/14/2000)   look foreward  commenting  the results
60	Lookthere are over 400 reviews  this book They are either 5 stars  they are complainers!  There   way you can use this book  what   says  not massively improve your body  ' been doing the program for  seven weeks  this weekend  grade school buddies told   was  the  best shape   life  They have known  since  was about ten  now  ' 33  ' gone from  34 inch waste with 19% body fat   30inch waste  with 95% body fat  ' the first time  twenty years ' been able   see results from  exercise  And the best part  this program  its  easy!   workouts now take 20 minutes  40 minutes max!   workout  the  road because   longer have  excuse not  workout for 20 minutes  The  eating program takes effort but you know what you get  life what you  put   The supplements which  have been taking for the last seven weeks  are awesome!   love them  you know what they are expensive but  honestly   the junk food  use  buy before  read this book  Bottom  line this  not  fad program its life changing   for !
5	Overall this book  disappointing Phillips  seems  not  real hardcore type  bodybuilder guy nor  this book ' got great general  fitness info  you  average &quotjoe&quot but  was disappointed   this  not  hardcore bodybuilding book ' good for what  does  general fitness info but take   that  you want nardcore muscle  read Arnold' book otherwise stick with this book  you are just  starting out buy this book  will help you  you are  advanced  bodybuilder well the weight   your back  you know where the rack   !
41	ONLY FOR THE MOST DISCIPLINED!   you have the time  document everything you eat  all the exercise you  along with the discipline   plan out six very concise meals  day then this program  for you  Body  For Life   very difficult way for the average person  live  Bill puts  forward  very structured program that must  followed  the letter    does not work    mother  3 little kids  guarantee you that this  program will only work for those  you who have alot  time  your day   dedicate  fitness   the beginning  sounds like  easy way   lose weight but ' not
11	This book will not help someone who  looking  change their lifestyle for more than 12 weeks ( you can stick  the program that long)  The  manner  which the program expects you  eat  impossible for any normal  person (unless you love nutitional shakes)  The only thing that this book  will give you   hole  your wallet
161	Having competed  one  Bill Phillips $1 Million Challenges subscribing  his Muscle Media magazine reading his book  spending over $1000  EAS nutritional products  can' honestly recommend that you buy this book   The logic Bill uses  definately good but  takes forever  get   the point!    his magazine  tickles you with  feather all the way  through but never reveals the &quotsecret&quot  This might sound  like sour grapes but all   urging you    watch your wallet!   There are pleanty  sources out there for this information  the net   best  all they' FREE ( See Lee Labrada' site  Did you know that  several  the past EAS $1 million champions followed this diet  opposed   Bill Phillips?)Buyer Beware!
40	Many Americans are overweight   seems that the majority  people who have given Phillips' work positive reviews wanted  lose weight  ' just the opposite:  ' been skinny all  life   body doesn'  respond  any particular way whether  work out  not  did follow this  program for twelve weeks but the result was not nearly  spectacular   the published testimonials would lead   expect  didn' find the diet  part  the book too hard  follow   generally eat this way all the  time   simply cut  regular three meals per day into six with the total  amount  consumed per day remaining equal  Except that  use   supplements (the program recommends but does not require them)  followed  the program  the letter alternating between aerobic  weight training   Phillips recommends  After twelve weeks  had gained some muscle mass   lost some body fat but the difference  made   physical  appearance was negligible one would  hard-pressed  tell you which  photograph was  &quotbefore&quot picture  which was   &quotafter&quot!  think that Phillips  doing the majority  his  readers  disservice  promoting his &quotchallenges&quot   publishing the winners' pictures  Most people are not going  look  anything like the &quotafter&quot pictures once they have completed  twelve weeks  this program   suspect  marketing ploy here: Many folks  will probably think that the problem lies  something THEY did  did not    rush out  buy Phillips' NEXT book!  This represents the most  cynical type  salesmanship making people feel like failures then  selling them &quotinformation&quot  how not    own suggestion   anyone who  considering embarking   program  become more muscular   not  waste time  money  this book  Both would  better spent    gym membership   competent personal trainer  She   can provide all  the information that'  this book plus tailor  program  your  particular needs

134	'  the 11th week  this program  while ' not  two weeks going  look like the photos inside the book--those are the champions  the Body-for-LIFE challenge-- will probably only take   month   more   get there This  not bad considering prior  this  had more--less  given   being much more than thin since muscle-building programs  always seem  take hours  And  have built more muscle working with  weights for 45-minutes  day three times  week than  have  any  previous program ' tried  matter how lengthy The thing  keep   mind  you use  Philips' system  that you will  gaining weight   well  losing  ' only netted about  pound  week weight loss--but  ' lost much more than that  fat since ' gained considerable muscle  mass This   good thing unless you' obsessed with the numbers  the  scale The system for eating isn'  diet  the traditional  crash-weight-loss sense You don' measure stuff out with scales   tape-measures you  have  maintain your integrity when picking portions  for yourself (There'  simple guideline) You eat six meals  day from   simple menu (Philips recommends  powdered drink mix but  don' care for  those  the program still works for )This  the real genius   the diet though: One day  week you can eat whatever you want however  much you want   the book  Philips says that you'  happy  get  back  your regular eating pattern after your &quotfree day&quot even  after only six days  the diet  didn' believe  when  read   was  astounded  experience  for myself ('  binge eater normally:  eat  one  two huge meals  day easily  15  24 hours without food enjoy  fasting  This program changed that quickly  rather easily) '  enjoyed  free days  some weeks ' looked forward  them more than  others but ' glad   back  ( new) normal diet afterwardevery  timeThis really == something you can  for the rest  your life  without completely organizing your life around exercise  diet The  exercise routines are quick  remarkably effective The diet  flexible  enough  where you never have  cheat What more  you want?Well   Amazon would let   would knock  half--star out for  few annoying  things: The graphic design  the book  not helpful (Even the  typesetting  the title  obnoxious) The graphics for the workouts  communicate the concept but don' really help you  you' sweataing  through one And why   that the three groups  foods (proteins  carbohydrates vegetables) have exactly the same number  entries  the  table? Seems like the list could  expanded  bitAnd let'  honest:  the number one source  philosophers  America are diet/exercise gurus  This book   exception being filled with insights  philosophies   how  live  take control  our lives     don' have  problem  with this (  Philips' philosophy  fairly workable) but the sheer  amount   can make  difficult  just =find= the meat  the program  (the exercise  diet patterns)  also always get  chuckle out   specious analogies like &quotgrazers are horses&quot where &quotbingers  are bears&quot  which  you want  look like?  yeah? How about cows  (they graze)  lions (who binge)? But these are minor points (Like  the editorial review that thinks ' weird that carbohydrates   vegetables are listed separately--well the vegetables are all  the  low-cal variety   wouldn'   replace lettuce with  plate   pasta would ?) The major point  that  works   manageable
4	Overall  found this  good book  help with changing your body  lifeBUT  had  wonder when looking through the &quotsuccess stories&quot  Where are all the people(esp women)  age?   found very  few testimonials from women  the middle years who are facing hormonal  changes etc    ink the author neglected this group  therefore this  book was not  keeper for  Maybe  has better examples  people  the  40 plus category  his website
58	Although Phillips would like  extend accessibility  his book  everyone  cannot   must admit that the book   very useful guide  get back into fitness  its detailed descriptions  the workouts   nutrition plan  meticulous  well thought out  However  all  honesty  should have been called &quotBody for Life for Overweight  People&quot  something along those lines   have  doubt that  has  helped millions  people who are out  shape  several pounds  overweight reclaim the bodies  their youth  -- more importantly --  feel better  What this book does not   good job  covering  how   one  very lean  build  bigger body Phillips offers only one page   the subject saying those wishing  gain muscle but not lose weight should  follow the Training for Life  the Nutrition for Life Programs but says  nothing about the 20 minute aerobics workout  how  modify   fit  not overweight people   have  filling ' avoiding the issue  that  maybe 12 weeks isn' long enough for someone (like ) who' very thin   put  enough weight  achieve his ( her) desired body   also thought  the fact that  didn' outline  aerobics program for such people was  slightly dangerous -- isn' some kind  cardio workout necessary for  everyone? What  also does not  into  the tremendous resources one  would have  have  complete the program which you should know about  before you even start  Though this could probably  without saying   clearly has middle-class America  mind   suggests  set  weights   home  better than gyms but people who might afford the book  40-50%  off might not  able  afford the home set  weights   gym  membership also the location  such  gym  important  you don' have  either room  money for equipment  home  The enormous amount  food  you have  buy  astonishing  yes the shakes are helpful but  expensive -- andof course ' trying  sell them  Perhaps the  consideration  the financial status  the people who buy this book   not valid grounds for criticism but since  might  helpful information  for prospective buyers who won' have the budget for the body/life  transformation ( therefore for whom the book will  almost worthless)  they should  warned  feel the book does have certain benefits  although   for certain people disadvantageous For instance  got   back  the gym for the first time  two years  has given  (however  indirectly -- how exactly  you  measure the portions  food  the size   your fist especially  like  your fist  really big?)  general  idea  how much food  will need  eat  gain the weight for  Body for  Life far  the writing style goes most  the success stories are  sugar-coated although they have helped  lot  people take  good look   just how much they have  how good they really have    also puts  too much stress  looking good  not enough  feeling good  That the  book   product   beauty-obsessed culture  self-evidentOverall   think the book  very helpful   lot  people but  gave  only two  stars because people need  beware  its limitations  well  the  financial situation  requires
7	 enjoyed the book but for  few exceptions  Yes the workouts are meant   intense  the diet rigorous  This  why the BFL program works   recommend   others who have the self discipline  commit  12 weeks   training not unlike  athlete going into competition  The book  offers  easy solutions  getting  shape   you are looking for   quick fix diet program don' read the book   you are looking for   recreational exercise program with light weights  low intensity cardio  again don' read the book  Bill Philips suggests  life style change  that makes sense  those who are highly motivated  need  little push   begin his program The book  not without faults   beleive the  pushing  myoplex  way overdone  There are others cheaper products that  work just fine  The daily protein requirements are the same whether you  weigh 110 pounds  250 pounds  200+ grams  daily protein   much for  some individuals  Portion sizes are difficult  determine  those who  may  new   diet program  Overall  recommend the book  anyone  who has been searching for  program that promotes intense short duration  training   alternative   unfocused diet  exercise program  You  will not regret reading the book whether you complete the BFL program   not!
2	Incredible information the puts all  the pieces together for the non-bodybuilding folks that want  get  the best body they can build    tough  get  early work out harder than ever before (but    shorter time)  focus  eating regular meals - 6 per day   body   always getting nourishment (but  use  lot  protein bars  make this  work for  lifestyle)   takes inspriation (Phillips prefers  point   internal inspiration rather than external motivation -  switching   perspective this way somehow works much better for )   have been    for 8 weeks the changes   body are easy  spot   walk   mirror  -   not gonna end  looking like the upper echelon  the book -   least not after the first round - but   MUCH better off after the 8  weeks ( will continue for 4 more)   plan  immediately begin  another 12 then another then another

5	This book does not provide the structure required for the food end  the diet  has great descriptions  the exercises  planning The food however  briefly decribed   the benefits  each grouping   one  week meal plan  included The (not--cheap) protein powder  also  prominently featured  &quotsuggested&quot  well Unless you have  ALOT  extra time  plan this program around the rest  your life this  may not  the plan for you
5	This program  completely laid out for you  Yes Bill Phillips promotes his EAS products but that doesn' mean the program doesn' work   has taken what  knows about nutrition science  exercise  combined   with the formula  success (hard work dedication competition   sacrifice)  deliver  fool-proof method  build  better  stronger  body  mind   his 'Body  Work' video  mentioned that the Greeks  believed that when you strengthen your body you strengthen your mind   Having done the program  know now how true that statement   The  information  nutrition  exercise  nothing earth-shattering   However knowledge  nothing without action  This book  designed   help you take action  Like  'The Matrix' &quotThere'  difference  between knowing the path  walking the path&quot  This book will  &quotshow you the door but you' the one who has  walk through  &quot  Bill Phillips could   the other side  that door giving you   check for $100000
2	 have been  athlete all  life (35 years)  When  family tragedy occupied ALL   time for two years  gained over 30 pounds  Following the author' program put    good  shape  when  was  high  school   get results  stongly recommend morning workouts before  eating  You must push yourself  your threshold  pain  pay attention   your meals   have recommended this book  dozens  others   all  pushed eachother  have all achieved fantastic results!
9	 all know the best way  improved health   eat well get lots  rest  excercise  But few people   good  job  helping the reader know just how   that than Bill Phillips  This   excellent book  full  useful information  excellently timed words  encouragement for  all those who need  kick  the bum  get    something about your  well-being   you' never worked out before  want  start then  start with this book!
8	The main part  the supplements  getting the carbs  protein but you can get these  other forms for alot less money Egg whites  legumes are  great source  protein  pasta oatmeal fruits  veggies are  good sources  carbs Don' let the price discourage you  hate  supplement drinks!  you eat 4 egg whites   bowl  oatmeal (for  example) instead  the supp you will basically  getting the same thing    tastes alot better  may not end  being  ripped  the supp  people but  will look great  save alot  money!  seems   that   order  keep that ripped physique you would have  continue drinking  the EAS three times  day for the rest  your life  that  around  $150  month! That' alot  money!
10	Many  the folks criticizing this book obviously haven' read  properly While Phillips does provide information about his EAS products  NEVER says they are essential for success they are merely available for  those who have busier schedules  cannot stomach bringing some cottage  cheese  yogurt  workWhile the exercises can   bit steep   first  clearly states that you cannot expect    his level   should start off with what YOU can  While this will  trial  error   first  does state that  once you got the routine down you' off   runningFinally the claim that you have  belong   gym  have  thousands  dollars  equipment  baloney  went  the store spent  about $150 for weights   bench  can  the required exercises   know the investment  worth   get  health back! homeopath  recommended this book   trust him completely  you' serious about  turning your life around this  the book  get Remember the old saying:   Pain  Gain  was sore  first because  the years  neglect but  the motivational aspects  the book have kept  going  results are  coming BTW Bill  also  strong supporter  the Make--Wish  Foundation   big chunk  the profits  there  you' not only  helping yourself you' also helping others  need!
4	The reason '  12 week program  because ' getting you prepared  live  healthy lifestyle You' getting into the habit  eatting nutritious foods  exercising   regular basis  doesn' say you HAVE   continue using his EAS products  you will fail  long  you center  your diet around Legumes Grains Carbs Fruits  Veggis the weight will  stay off  exercise will help you  look  feel your best Sure alot   books  say the same things over  over but continuing  read the  info  educating your self  what keeps you motivated ' got 20 books    shelf that basically all say the same thing but ' learned very  important things from each book This book isn' about fad diets '  about lifestyle change
4	Sure  may sound the same BUT this plan allows you  eat  doesn' recommend  long workout  the gym for  healthy body And unlike Joe Weider Phillips does not promote steroid bodybuilders  the epitome   health  fitness Don' blame Phillips because  pushes supplements (  owns EAS) because Weider does the same thing The critic/skeptic that  tries  undermine the information here does  injustice  the thousands   people that have been helped because  this information Phillips talks  the talk  walks the walk Not too many supplement manufactures   fitness magazine owners can say the same thing
0	This   marvelous 12-week program for eternal health  well-being Before  brother   started the program  found   bit overwhelming Especially the parts  nutritional spplements But  did  the program anyway   both have never felt better  our lives!  The  main point  Phillip' book   follow  totally  gives you all the  answers for fitness  health But  believe that  you add any  your  own modifications  changes during the 12 weeks  don' believe that you  will get the full impact  the program ' pretty easy once you get into   And the results are devastating!   say the least

22	' read  many workout/diet books that never seem  catch  with    WAS very suspicious  this book before buying   The book  very motivational   written for everyone  understand (not  lot  tech  lingo)  This program  also very simple  follow  could easily   continued beyond the 12-week period ( intended   )The only  downfall  think  the lack  guidelines for the novice  far  the  workouts are concerned BUT the author really wants the reader  succeed   even offers  24-hour phone line   web site for support  Also  you  not have  use the food supplements mentioned  ' only used REAL  food   multi-vitamin   seeing results!     fourth week   the BFL Program  feel  much better physically mentally  spiritually   would  have recommended this book  others   good buy    opinion
57	 liked Body for Life because  shows you what you need    order  get healthy  Like  lot  people  just went &quotdownstairs&quot   weight bench  worked out   had  plan  how  lifted nor the  knowledge for  body' nutritional needs  build muscle      The book  also stresses the importance  not overtraining  The body doesn' build  muscle while you are lifting weights but when you are  rest AFTER you  lift weights   all makes sense  just never knew      ' been    own modified version  the book' program for about 5 weeks now  '  lost 25 pounds  fat   abs are starting  show  lot  people here  have said that ' nothing but  lot  hard work  ACTUALLY ' not  that hard  The hardest part for  was the eating   loved MacDonalds  candy cake etc  The funny thing  ' allowed this junk food once   week  The book concentrates  rewards   you look  the cardio system   makes you say  yourself   1 more minute  can make    30 more seconds  can    once you finished  you get that  little break   feels good   Just like the food  ' Saturday 1  more day  '  free day      The book   good investment   you  don' follow the program ' still good knowledge
58	Sure there   way  loose weight  get fit other than  exercising more  eating lessAlmost every adult knows this  But few can behave consistently according  this factPhillips' book   superb attempt   motivate the overweight/unfit  apply that simple fact conscientiously   their livesThe book   first rate design has excellent  illustrations  should appeal  those 30  plus who appreciate   quality package that speaks directly  them  2000Being  happy  vegetarian  could quibble with the meat bias  the book  Being    skeptical frame  mind   sure that many  the transformations  depicted  the real life stories actually took more than 12 weeks (Bill  doesn' say they were achieved  12 weeks all  does   tell  that  real transformations can occur  12 weeks)Bill does not hide the fact  that getting fit  loosing pounds  hard work  But  gives the reader  the motivation  push through that hard work  ' Australian  find  myself turned off  &quotyankee hype&quot but must say that the  motivational sections  Body for Life were not ( some other Amazoncom  reviewers assert) over the top  found them persuasive   the  pointTwo more pluses: (1)  don' think anyone could  driven   anorexic/bulimic eating behaviours  this book   gives coherent  practical commonsense advice  (2) The photographs  descriptions   exercises are well-chosen leaving little scope for error  the  inexperiencedEven for people not interested  health diet   fitness ' recommend this book   first rate example among the best   the voluminous self-help literature
15	 liked the way this book addressed the number one reason most people want  lose weight:   look better  themselves  The before  after pictures are pretty amazing  certainly got  attentionPhillips'  program  bound  improve your appearance  You will  doing  lot more  weight lifting for each major muscle group  aerobics than most have ever  done  our lives  The main thing that was new   was the idea  going   peak performance several times during  exercise  then ending  the  peak   haven' tried  yet but  sounds interestingThe nutritional  advice doesn' have much behind   help you understand why  will   won' work   certainly doesn' seem extreme although 350 pound people  eat the same portions  80 pound people   can' figure that one out  Maybe you canWhatever the merits  this program  certainly  well  explained   deals with being ready  change psychologically setting  goals getting goal reinforcement changing your attitudes  ways   living  how  deal with setbacks  There are lots  heart-warming  stories   already mentioned the before  after pictures  There'   good    section with FAQs  Although  tend  get lost  the weight  room  think  could follow this program  There are lots  photographs   show the right methods  charts  fill out  see how you are  doingYou also get  lot  support   has  Web site where you can  chat with others going through the program  You can also call  talk    counselor who will encourage you  You get the sense that Phillips really  cares   don' remember reading  fitness book that shows its heart   well  this one does main reservation  that the program may  too  much for those with more modest goals like people who read  lot  write  lots  book reviews  Amazoncom such     would  curious     mini version  this but ' have  design  own program  guess  This  one  for those who really want  look absolutely great!    you   this book may well help you  ' sorry  don' have any personal  experience with the program  share with youGood luck with being  healthier regardless  whether you read  follow this book' advice   not!design  own program  guess  This  one  for those who really want  look absolutely great!    you   this book may well help you  ' sorry  don' have any personal  experience with the program  share with you  Good luck with being  healthier regardless  whether you read  follow this book' advice   not!
90	This book   comprehensive step  step structured program for achieving  positive body transformation   specific amount  time And that was exactly what  was looking for Afterall what  less than 3  months  finally get back into shape? But make  mistake there  loads   discipline  hard work involved with this  you intend   the  distance  who said losing fat was easy?This book sets   program  for the reader  follow day  day for 12 weeks including food   exercise routines Every 7th day   day off both diet  exercise All  routines are trademarked  Bill Phillips   suggests that you must  follow the program &quot  &quot  All meals ( there are 6  day)  are precisely combined protein  carbohydrate based  portion sizes    advocates using his company' liquid meal replacement for 3  those  &quotmeals&quot which  did not  You cannot eat all you want  one  meal There   heavy reliance  animal based products for protein   course   categorizes vegetables  ' own food group  However all  that seems trivial considering the results you' get  you follow this  methodThere are  exercise videos  buy  follow other than  QuickTime demos for exercises available  the website  this may seem  awkward  anyone with  aversion  learning exercises quietly through  text (The old fashioned way) The weight exercises are simple  dull   most can  performed  home  you have  good range  weights    bench but you must follow the rep routine  outlined  the book   &quotAerobics&quot are short intense 20 minute sessions 3 times  week  Believe  after doing  least 4 hours  cardio per week previously this  was  big selling feature! Also you exercise preferably    &quotfasting&quot state  first thing  the morning  burn fat   This definitely was  new way   things for   took some adjusting   but the weight training component alone was worth the  troubleOverall  consider this  excellent program  follow for  anyone who wants  get back  track with fitness  eating   find  muscle you never knew you had Also the Free Day every 7th day  the most  fun  all!  What other diet  exercise program gives you that? But   would suggest  anyone reading this that you may not get the Championship  results advertised  the &quotbefore  afters&quot with this book  program alone especially  you don' use the liquid supplementation    you binge  10000 extra calories every Free Day But you will get fit   get leaner  you will  able  throw out your &quotfat&quot  clothes

72	Waste  time waste  money  This  basic body building repackaged with  high protein diet   still have  pamphlet from the 1970s  Joe Weider that espouses exactly the same thing that  being said here    fraction  the cost  without the contest hoopla (what  90s thing!  sheesh) doubt about   you follow this plan you' loose weight   buff   But how many people are actually going  stick  this?   Yeah yeah  got suckered into buying this book cause everybody everywhere   talking about   But being  veteran  the diet wars (anyone remember  the grapefruit diet the first time around?)  should have known better  There are  magic bullets   magic cures  Losing weight  tough  hard work  This author isn' saying anything you haven' heard before:   eat less  exercise  ' just got  very slick package going for    Your money can  better spent   new pair  walking shoes

27	 was dissapointed  this book  The section  weight training was  but the section  nutrition was poorly done  The author advocates  diet  3 meals  day supplemented with 3 servings  &quotMyoplex&quot  nutritional supplement that  produced  the company EAS (the authour  also happens   the CEO  EAS)  Each meal consists  1 portion   carbohydrate combined with 1 portion  protein   serving   vegetables  &quotportion&quot   serving roughly the size   open  palm   closed fist  The thing  find very strange  that this  the  diet the authour recommends for EVERYONE   think   very odd that  5  foot 100 pound housewife could eat the same   6 foot 4 250 pound  construction worker  that they would both get good results from  training  This book does not seem  take into account that different  people have different nutritional  caloric needs based  their age  sex activity level training goals etc etc etc   would have thought  that Bill Phillips with all his access  sophisticated research would   aware  this   you want  get  shape  would suggest consulting  Frank Zane' &quotFabulously Fit Forever&quot before this book
4	Bill Phillips  incredibly inspiring  this book  really motivates   makes  think  myself   more positive lightPreviously all the other books that  had encountered were  far -  those health  infomercials  television falled short  their promisesNow    proud  say that  have more muscle mass than before   look great!

13	 was  bit disappointed with the content  this book   was looking for  personal trainer   book  instead found someone repeating himself for half the book  the mental part  getting  shape   have the  motivation now  want the technique  Bill Phillips spends most  the  book just trying  motivate you but doesn' give enougth detail   technique  how  set   program personalized  each individual   There are  references  the best number  reps how fast  slow you  should lift the weights how  individualize  program  what  machine/exercises are best for each individual (especially differences  between men  women)   have found another book that focuses  women  only   more beneficial  meet  specific needs  help plan with   individual schedules  body  Bill  too much hype  not enougth  muscle
13	While the exercise program  nice  can  too advanced for  beginner    easy  push yourself too hard  injure your body  following the intensity recommendations  the book   would  beneficial    pre-program workout were included for those who don' work out much with  weights  The nutrition tips thought were good although  prefer Metrex  cause  can get  for much less than Myoplex   buy   Costco

25	Body for Life provides  well structured  balanced program that  great for both beginners  experienced trainers  The nutrition plan involves eating relatively small balanced meals throughout the day but  does not require calorie counting  other &quottracking&quot techniques  that can become frustrating  feel controlling  The exercise side  the  program involves regular weight training  cardio exercise  Again  nothing that requires  ridiculous time commitment  can  pretty easily  integrated into your daily routine have been lifting for years   found the planning recommendations (plan your meals  exercise ahead   time)  great addition   routine  Writing everything down ahead   time forces   think about how  structure  day  still integrate  good nutrition  exercise  said this book also has  lot   offer experienced trainiers   particular  was referring  the planning  mentioned above but  also provides another training split that  worth  trying  you are looking for some variety  your program   just  few  weeks  doing this  have already seen  bodyfat drop -- mainly because  cardio  now planned into  routine  However  should also say that for  experienced trainers much  the key information  this book can   obtained from the Body for Life website  some  the articles that  appeared  Muscle MediaSeveral other reviews have suggested this  book  nothing more than  supplement    heavily dependent   supplements  This  just not true  The book does suggest the use   supplements   couple pages but does not say they are required for the  program  doesn' try  push them throughout the book  This   something you can complete eating standard foods --  shakes powders   pills required there   downside   that the book lacks  direction  where   after the initial 12 weeks  Sure you can  continue  the program  perhaps modify   little  keep things  interesting but  doesn' address what  you  you are really  interested  building muscle ( whatever your goal )    fair   say this book isn' the proper place for such things but  would  nice    provided some initial information  guidance  these areas the program  perhaps modify   little  keep things  interesting but  doesn' address what  you  you are really  interested  building muscle ( whatever your goal )    fair   say this book isn' the proper place for such things but  would  nice    provided some initial information  guidance  these areas

14	This book  100% accurate   completely about being healthy  For those who say the book   self promotion  you read the book you will see differently  Also for those who say that they could get better  results following  sensible diet  exercise plan they certainly didn'  read the book  That  EXACTLY what the book tells you how   correctly   accurately   great detail (only essential details though)   This book gives  program based  the principles  proper nutrition   exercise  gives  complete program that will change your life  The  reason this book   great  not that  offers something  &quotnew&quot  What this book offers  all the information that  experts  healthy people have known for years but that the average  person has not  Bill puts  all together  the absolute simplist  ways   that even people who have never worked out  people that have worked  out for years can  The skepticism comes from the fact that people  have never seen others  things the RIGHT way with all the essential  pieces  the puzzle  When you  things that right way the results are  simply amazing   have achieved those results personally  seen others   this same This book  second  none
64	Having just completed 12 weeks  the program  thought  would pen  impressions  The only thing that kept  from giving  5 stars  the before  after pictures  the contest winners While serving    motivation for many  wife started the program when  did but because  after 7 weeks she was not  schedule  look like those  the book she  gave  (although remains  weekend warrior)  Remember these are the  winners out   pool  over 50000 contestants!  The real beauty  the  program  its simplicity  Believe  once you get into the   &quotworkout lifestyle&quot you will get conflicting advice---stick with  the program!   stuck with the program probably  well  anyone could  but  Bill were  interview   would admit  not drinking  much  water  recommended ( hate !)  being very sporadic with  supplements   observations: 1)after 6 weeks  hit  wall  Probably  because  had never stuck   exercise program for  extended period   was totally worn out  ready  give    thought exercise was supposed   make you feel better!  After summoning  reserves  will-power   continued  now feel great!   patient  scale the wall  2)  Probably  due  genes (stocky Irish)   debilitating injury  results were good  but nothing like those pictured  the book   weight went from 189   175 but  went from 41&quot  36&quot   &quotlove handles&quot  which  pretty amazing   prepared  plateau after 3-4 weeks  rapid  gains (losses)  remember the health benefits not just the asthetics  While  was not important    strength has increased nearly 75%! 3)  ' horrible with remembering  take the supplements but did notice that  Creatine made  big difference  gaining strength   the final analysis  its  great program that  simple enough for anyone  realistic enough   stay  for the rest  your life!

53	 did not read Bill' book because  needed  lose weight  get  shape  bought  read   see what all the fuss was aboutFirst  want  commend Bill  his quest  get people into shape His monetary  support for the Make  Wish Foundation  very  very noble act   well have  state however   Personal Trainer  have quite  few  problems with how the book presents information  some cases  think the  advice being given  questionable    few instances the information   just plain wrong  only going  give  couple  examples because  there  not enough room  present everythingBill mentions  the diet  section that yogurt qualifies   carbohydrate Yogurt  NOT   carbohydrate    protein source The best quality protein comes from  animal sources Yogurt   animal source protein The only time  carbohydrates are associated with yogurt  when fruit  sugar are added   that point the yogurt becomes something that weight loss enthusiasts  MUST avoid because  contributes  weight gainBill advocates using  artificial sweeteners like Aspartame  replace sugar This  very highly  questionable advice coming from someone who  supposed    health  expert For   make the statement that Aspartame  dangerous  your  health would not  doing you any favors Instead  suggest you get  &quotAspartame (Nutrasweet)   Safe?&quot  Roberts Read this book  you will swear off Aspartame for the rest  your life   healthier for Bill' discussion  diet  sadly lacking  information  fact the section  diet  only 17 pages out   200 page book  think that  lot  important information was left out  such  crucial area  weight loss While  believe that motivation  essential  success  the weight loss game  have  say that  lot  the stuff Bill  talking about  fluffy filler   right  attempting  get the reader pumped   motivated enough  take  the program but his motivational techniques are not empowering  therefore are not easily sustainable There are much more powerful motivational techniques out there that lead  permanent success the end  would have  difficult time recommending this book because  does not give enough viable information  empower the reader

7	 very good book Bill' book  the first  read which goes  depth about how  deal with intensity during training ' yet  find another book which explains   that simple manner The proper usage  intensity   really the key  the trainig success (  currently using the method  myself  believe   really works) ' also like  comment  some   the discussion points: 1) Warm : The first two sets are only intensity  5  6  this  your warm  for the muscle 2) Supplements: Most  bodybuilders will tell you that your success  50% training  50%  nutrition Without supplements   difficult  eat  digest the  various quantities (protein vitamins etc) that make your muscles grow  (although  needn'  Myoplex) Many people just don' have the digestive  power 3) Aerobic Training:  look into the scientific sports literature  tells you that you get  noticeable cardiovascular training effect after 10  minutes  20 minutes  NOT too little! 4) Pictures:  could imagine that  some people try  win the contest  going  steroids making the  'before' photograph look especially bad taking the 'after' photograph  after  longer time than 12 weeks etc  have trust  the jury that they  find out who cheated  who did not And even  not the method still  works  this  the most important thing for the reader

0	The bottom line  the program works  when you follow  for just 2  3 weeks you will see for yourself  The fat drops off  your body  you will get stronger    not  easy workout  any  means  long  you follow the rules BUT  works
1	drcook' suggestion that the 'Body  Work' contest winners were  steriods  unfounded  fact  one tested positive  their drug test  you watch the video carefully the problem you' referring  was that  initial polygraph tests &quotshow() some deception&quot for  few  individuals ' sorry that you don' believe that the transformations  these people had were real  really says more about you than Bill  Phillips  his program   ' true that anyone can    went  through 7 weeks  his program  few months ago   had people tell    looked great  wish  would have completed the 12 weeks - ' probably  look awesome ' not going  quit though ' going  begin again   complete the 12 week transformation!

0	What impresses  most about this book  the plan  promotes  the man behind both His commitment  helping people like  get their health  life back  track  evident  variety  resources including booklets  audio cassettes videos  24 hour/day telephone support staff are all  offered free  charge  Let the skeptics say what they will about  marketing ploys  sacharine sentiments   the book were merely  plug  for EAS supplements  suspect the author would have devoted more than   scant couple  pages  the subject  Neither   think that ' have  made the point that anyone willing  invest the time  preparing six  whole-food meals per day could expect the same results  those who opt for  the convenience  using supplements  And  far  Phillips' using the  book  yet another way  line his pockets let' not forget that 100%   the proceeds that would have gone  him from the sale  the book are  instead being donated  the Make  Wish Foundation    not some Bill  Phillips devotee who  incapable  objectivity   just recognize that   the end  the day the guy' making good  the promises  makes '   devised  system that' netting terrific results for lot'  people   sharing the wealth  enjoys   result  that success Those are good  enough reasons for  ' starting Monday too
59	' been reading Bill Phillip' magazine for  little while now  ' come  love him not only for the cutting-edge info that  continues  provide but because  his attitude  personality with which   approaches anyone interested  fitness This book  amazing because 1)  outlines  VERY effective weight-training  cardio program given that  you TRULY follow the recommended intensity pattern 2) explains   provides real information for changing one' eating habits  the healthy  6--day program  outlines 3)   ridiculously motivational  positive  hopeful  characteristics which become engrained  you  whenever you read his book / magazines truly don' understand how  there are these messed- venemous reviews  here for &quotBody-for  -Life&quot These people have OBVIOUSLY not really read the book have  failed themselves MISERABLY  trying  follow the program ( thus are  looking  place their feeling  failure onto someone else)  have been  shot   minimum  5 times  their lives  therefore are annoyingly  bitter  cynical towards the worldThe fact  Bill sends out free  books tapes videos    turn gives TONS  proceeds  the  Make--Wish foundation!    great uplifting guy  anyone who reads  his book sees the videos  HONESTLY dedicates themselves  the program  (for only 3 months  their LIVES -- what'  lose?) will wind  really  appreciating all  doesThanks for being  awesome guy Bill Phillips  &quotBody-for-Life&quot  tremendous!!!

10	this book  weak  poorly written   raises more questions than  answers  the jist  the book could  summarized  10 pages saving readers the tiresomepreachy philosophy lesson  the book encourages   motivates readers fine  however   detailed &quothow &quot step   step guide  falls short  much better book very detailed   quantitative  The Lean Routine   don' recall the author' name  Finally would suggest buying the magazine  saving your money - the  same information  found  the magazine
1	Wow what varying opinions here  very interesting comment from some wannabe claiming that the photos are doctored  they are fine  haven' taken any photos  myself but the results are amazing Energy through the  roof twenty pound weight loss (10  ) muscle definition for the first  time ever  time  enjoy  life wife  kids  yes   hunger   mood swings either Fat pants  the back  the closet size 34 back   the frontFor those  you who don' like the idea  20 minutes   aerobics 30 like   All  know  that  sure feel better now doing  interval training Did Bill Phillips publish this book  make more money   selling supplements? Probably   care? Absolutely not!

The shakes are just  good  any  the market  they make  easy  eat 6 meals  day  They also satisfy  sweet tooth! This program  much better suited for someone who  out  shape  looking  transform themselves not body builders looking  add more mass  The bottom line   you stick    commit yourself  will work   book  going  change your life  The change comes from you the book  just the tool that helps you

4	Initially  didn' think much  this book  Not anything   didn' already know  applied   15 +  - years  weight training  Nothing  hadn' seen  some form  various bodybuilding  fitness magazines  including Bill Phillips MUSCLE MEDIA  did  one  his transformation  challenges   believe his contest  all the before  after photos  are legit (*see postscript  this issue*)    let  set for  while   then  husband picked   read   actually seemed interested    got out the cooler  take food  work  actually worked out   hasn'  worked out consistently  long  ' known him    decided  take   second look      looking  this again  giving   try for  week   love   ' not  that bad  shape   dropped three pounds this  week plus ' getting stronger rather than just staying  the same level    Though   very simple  follow  contains many complex principles   The routines will work for anyone because they use their own perceived  effort  the guideline  The progression from  5 effort  cycling    down towards 8/9 - 10 efforts contains its own warm- effect   uses  the progressive resistance  pyramiding principles  finishes off  with  super set!  The pushing towards  maximum effort  one set  much  more realistic than trying    the max every set  every rep  Some  people might need    bit more   warm-   cool down but  think   you start   5 out  10 effort  work your way  that    adequate warm-      The portion method  the nutrition program   much simpler  follow than calorie counting  long  you' honest   the portion size  allowed foods   don' feel  deprived    when  ' counting calories  weighing out foods  Getting enough fiber   possible  think ' tend  switch out  bran cereal for the carbs once   twice  day  Otherwise   certainly better than the average person'  diet   quite livable    like Myoplex (the EAS brand meal  replacement shake) but there are other products that are just  good   not  pricey  Check some  the online supplement stores they can  deliver   price  good  better than the GNC gold card day just  watch the shipping charges when calculating your total cost  shop  around      All  all this book gives solid effective  livable  solutions  being fit  Bill Phillips always has  positive can-  attitude   easy  read   will probably  getting  few copies   this  give out  Christmas  friends  relatives   paid full retail   the local bookstore -  the Amazon price makes this  very good  value*****Postscript***** This  response  the charge that the  before  after photos  Bill Phillips' contest are faked:People lose   gain muscle/fat  their neck  that  what makes people think that  these are cut  paste jobs   know  bit about computer graphics '  seen all  the literature with better before  after photos    believe these photos are for real  Look  the men' chests there are  different types  nipples (pardon)  you can match that regardless   bodyfat Look  the faces  big weight loss shows  the face Porter  Freeman' face changed from his weight loss  That cannot  just pasting   head  the before photo Look   good color before/after  Lynn  Lingenfelter  has  huge scar  his stomach look  the hands - they  are the same!  Now  will say that many people  their before photos  purposely slouch push out their gut mess  their hair are pale look  depressed  other tricks  contrast with their after photos but that   not the same   cut--paste fraud   lost 15 lbs  fat  gained  5 lbs  muscle  16 weeks during the contest  entered last year   look  quite different   before  after photos  much more for someone who  lost more fat / gained more muscle

0	Bill Phillips tells you how  regain the physical self you once had  the physical self you wish for  Everyone interested   losing weight  toning  needs  read this book
1	 found the book   excellent Yes some  the information  basic but the fact  the matter  the program works The problem  see  there are  many people out  the world that can'  taught anything  They are too negative  many  the truths that are presented  them   this book From what  have seen   life  the people that can'  complete anything are too weak  admit  The book puts the entire  program right before you  use  you wish The lazy  narrow-minded  people will never get anywhere  matter what they try The program  the  book works for those who really follow   want  change their lives   you look  the ones that made the committment  change you wil find  they succeeded  changed their lives  recommended the book  all   friend  family   has already changed their lives   for EAS  supplements  haven' used any  them but still got results   people  would have bothered  look  the Sport Supplement Review (which Bill  gives away free) they would have read Bill would like for you  use his  products but  also stated you can use other products from his  competitors  get results    those who want  sit around  bash the  book  say get  life  stop trying  hold the ones back from achieving  their goals  life Roger Younce
1	This book contains basically everything  person would need  start  effective weight training program  agree with basically everything written with  few exceptions First  all  think the workout  guidelines may   little too rigid Everyone has different body types   not all will respond  the same workout  person like myself who has  been working out for years  has reached  plateu will probably not  benefit from the same set/rep regimine   person who just started working  out Another problem  noticed was that there  virtually  forearm  exercise even mentioned This  something that should have been addressed  Some people develop forearms quite well without any specialized exercises  but most probably  notOne caution  those who have  subscription   Muscle Media: you won' find much  this book you haven' already read  ' all good information but   somewhat redundant Also  would like   see one diet plan that doesn' include $10-15 dollars per day worth   Myoplex  can say that  would highly recommend this book  anyone  just starting  exercise program But  anyone who' been   for   while   already  Muscle Media subscriber you may not benefit that  much
1	 have never wrote  review before but after reading some  the reviews  Body for Life  felt compelled  speak   Notice that the great reviews are  people who are actually doing the program  The negative  reviews are  people who took the lazy way out  They read  then  discarded   bunk  TRY  first before passing judgment  Also  you  truly read the book then all the people complaining that Bill  trying   sell Myoplex weren' paying attention  The idea   eat 6 meals    offers Myoplex   way  make life easier for people who don' want the  hassle  planning 6 meals   tells you that you have the option  using  Mypolex  using food  The program works   should know  '  week  four  the results are amazing  '  personal trainer myself  '  hard  dispute such positive results   recommend the program  anyone  who' ready for the real thing
6	There' nothing here that you probably don' already know Nothing that you couldn' find for free  your public library Does the program work?  you follow  However isn' that true  just about any somewhat  rational diet/exercise regimen?  lost 40 lbs  simply reducing   portion sizes walking daily  working out with weights  understand  many   want  cheerleader  motivator some &quotexpert&quot  tell   what   when the hard part  just getting  with   doing  something Buy the book  you have little   access  diet/exercise  info
7	 found the book   very informative  well thought out   think the way Bill Phillips speaks  the book  just that   talking  you not  you  The information  nutrition not only makes sense but   very  easy    know because  started following his advice  soon    finished ! (which was  matter  hours  not days)The exercise  outline  gives   tough one  follow but you get  good workout   much less time  makes you take  hard look  yourself both inside   out ' follwed  for  week now  already feel better about  myself' like  say &quotthanks&quot  Bill Phillips for the  material because ' one  those people who exercise all the time   never saw results  This book will give direction  purpose  those who  have tried  quitThe information  this book was   the money  that ' decided  take  his &quotchallenge&quot  After reading    had the feeling  'what have  got  lose but wasted time  the gym   some excess fat?!' This book  not one that will  put   shelf   collect dust now that ' read     staying   night stand    can use    reference   reminder  what  can attain  The book  will totally change your attitude for the better  you let Once  again hats off  Bill Phillips  thanks
0	 really don' understand the love-hate war over this book  Being someone who  NOT  the least bit concerned about muscle mags  getting buff  thought the book was    agree that  has  lot  motivational  qualities   which  what most everyone needs  get moving   anything but  you are  person who   need  that sort   motivation  all means read this book   you aren' then don' read  this bookLike  said   just  regular person  fairly decent  health  shape  may not really need  read  book like this but   did   was alright  don' really care about the advertisements nor    care for drinking shakes  replace food but  feel that way about  anything like Slimfast Carnation Instant Breakfast the works  Nothing  personal against anyone But  the same time you  what you can  what  you want     you need/want some basic motivation this book  just  fine   plan  following the book  help out  friend but  wouldn'  call   godsend  even essential   each his  her own  this    own way  adding  little spice   life   Bottom line: the book     the money spent goes  charity  Can you beat that?
5	1   right about his call for healthier food the fact that loosing weight   life long endevour  the simple truth that you should have  life instead  living  the gym2 However  often contradicts his   metaphers like using the primitive homo sapiens (grazer)   example    not think they used artificial food supplements3 You  not need  supplements for  healthy body  Only  you want  burn away all your  body fat which has nothing   with health4 Exercise should not   done   46 minute time period only!

Warming   level 5 early  the  morning with weights can hurt you5  build  nice  lock muscle   not always the best  have They are pretty useless for stamina  you  enjoy  long biking tour (longer than the recommended 20 minutes) you will   lost with his aerobic tips6 Modern medical science has discoverd  that fat  not  useless blob  your your body  secrets  hormone  called Leptin   therefore part  your endocrine system  close  regular circle between fat  the brain  responsible for the homeostasis   your overall fat You can fight this physiological mechanism but you  wont win the fight (unless you stick   life long diet   supplements)7 What  wrong with the taste   nice full fat  yoghurt  Ben  Jerries Ice Cream  glass  wine  pork chops?  you  eat   moderate quantities you  not need  stick  your 7th day off   indulge All this authorization  certain food  over the top (Where   Tofu  excellent source  protein  this list?)

0	 you read ANY  the other reviews  they mention ANYTHING  all about Bill' products  that they think this book   vehicle  plug them that   complete  TOTAL joke There   total  25 PAGES  out   over 200 pages that mention ANYTHING  ALL about sports  suppliments  just started  this program after attempting  workout    off for 10 years (including having  one--one daily personal trainer)   this  the first time  have started  notice results! Just because  you read something  the internet (where anyone can say anything for free)  doesn' mean ' true all  can say  try  you can' loose when you  are spending less than 20 bucks  your body/life
0	 was 240 pounds with 22 % body fat  was getting lazyer  eat over the limit Body for life helped  lose 20 puonds  one month
7	Although Phillips' exercise regimen   think  reasonable one  ' clearly  good motivational speaker  found the book infuriating for two reasons:<> 1)  '  prolonged advertisement for Phillips'  nutritional supplements business    possible   fit  healthy  without taking all that overpriced stuff!<> 2)  His definition   &quotfit&quot  limited  those who are buffed  slender  This isn'  unique  him  course  But the idea that you have   buffed   slender  you' not &quotfit&quot has  think discouraged  lot   people from pursuing exercise regimes that are more appropriate for their  personal needs  The goal after all  not just &quotfitness&quot but  HEALTH  someone who' fat  old but takes  half-hour walk every day   probably generally healthier than someone who spends 12 weeks   Phillips' regimen  then gives   because they don' have the time
1	 you are  regular reader  Muscle Media than you will have read  lot  the book already  the form  previews  his editorials  each issue   you are not  are just starting  fitness program then  all  means give this book  chance find bill    extremely intelligent  person  great  what  does    more talented  the field   motivational speaking/writing than anything else  His fitness tips are for  the most part sound  the book does not overly promote his eas line   supplements  much   had expected you are interested   motivational words / just need somewhere  start  when you want   get  shape then the book   great choice   you are already  good  shape the book may prove useless  you

13	 have been following Bill Phillips work for years  Bill   great  selling his products producing materials  push his products such  MuscleMedia Ultimate Supplement Review  this book   think Bill  deserves some credit for being successful but  stop short  praise when   comes  this book   find his tips  aerobics dubious because  his  previous writings  suggested 40 minutes  now ' 20  Although  can  understand the positive reviewers desire  work less  get more the  reality  not  easy  Some reviewers have written about Bill' ability   motivate you  playing  your desire  look better  Although this   all well  good the reality  that years from now your health may  suffer from  program such  this  Take the 20 minutes  aerobics which  Bill claims  optimum   better body but what about your heart   circulation?   know this book  called Body for Life but  try  build   better body not only  look  but  live  long healthy life   also  have trouble with Bill Phillips pushing chemical laced supplements  meal  replacements  The body building industry has  past colored with steroids   growth hormones these are not people concerned with total health   Please look  first year issues  MuscleMedia 2000  understand their  position  your health '  little scary  The heart  the problem   that this program  too concerned with your appearance  less about your  total health  The interesting thing  that health  appearance are not  mutually exclusive  You can look good   something good for your body    don' think the answer  better total health lies  chemicals   minimal time exercises  This book  interesting reading   you are  looking for  program that will only make you look more muscular then you  may have found  answer   you are looking   much healthier   wouldn' suggest this book for anyone  Hence the one star   worried  this book  unhealthy  One last note  you are fat  completely  out  shape then you might have some use for this book   you haven'  been  the gym  years you could benifit
0	Body for Life   powerful book for those that are expecting  book for body builders will  however  sorely disappointed Body for Life  more   self help book disguised   sports nutrition/excercise book   Phillips runs through common threads  participants  the 12 week Body  for Life program Quite simply put the basis  the program  founded   our internal desires   better Readers are asked  dig down deep   find the things that motivate   move   Phillips asks   use  this motivation  help set goals   actions The premise  BODY  for LIFE   incorporate changes for life  achieve goals that lead   healthier bodies  minds The book concentrates  the Zen  change   how taking control  our bodies allows miraculous changes  other facets   our lives you think about  Body  Life really calls out   readers  take control but incorporating self-discipline into our daily  lives  improve our bodies  then ultimately other facets  our  livesThe book contains basic excercises  dietary information that  will aid readers  choosing the foods that will allow them  realize  their needs The book    nonsense approach  changing life   general would highly recommend this book ' high  inspiration    really written for every day people people from all walks  life This  book  equally about mind psyche  soul building    body  building  you want added inspiration  would also highly recommend  purchaing the BODY for LIFE cassette tape also which   lite version   the book  you want inspiration   means  get the best body thats  possible for you look  further than BODY for LIFE
2	First off let  say that Bill Phillips  running  business   course     for profit   should profit from his work   does quite well from MuscleMedia EAS NeoElite USR etc  ' happy  see him  donate book profits  charity good for him  Now why   give his book  one star?  This book  too much   advertisement for his products    felt like  bought  book telling  how  life will change with Amway   Maybe  life will change   get involved with Amway but  don' want   read  book about   Second Bill' program does not contain any new  information  Basically the book   rehash  Bill' magazine  other  fitness books  Third Bill' tone   bit much  Bill strokes his ego  more than the average bear  This book   one star book  counter all  those 5 star reviews   the positive reviews were honest they would give  this book three stars   deserves
0	 don' know what all these other negative folks readbut  wasn' the same book  read  After having read their comments (before  got  book)  was disappointed  Then  book came  What  found was  book that fed    every way -- physically mentally  emotionally  Sure some    was hard --  love Pizza -- but anything worth working for will have some  tough spots  But when  studied  applied what  read  made changes   ' going   50 years YOUNG this December    current pace with the  help  Body for Life  will   better shape than when  was 25  The  book was not FULL  advertisements for EAS products  But  what    was  Ever   Chrysler  buy  Ford?   have found the quality  EAS  products would  worth more coverage  They taste GREAT!! And they help  make the program complete    suggest you get the book  read   again  again  both  wife   have

0	Bill' program   elegantly simple  almost seems too easy but  really does work for ANYONE   does exactly what  says  does-- transforms you not just your body but your very life  This truly  the  only bodybuilding book you' ever need  ' that simple
0	Body for Life   compilation  author Bill Phillips' magazine MuscleMedia  About 75%  the book was already published  the magazine  one time   would  willing  bet the other 25% will appear within  the next 6 months  The workout itself  very good   have tried   before because  was  the magazine about 2 months ago   done  correctly does produce results  The diet section leaves  lot    desired  All  all  feel    below average book that can  read   looking  the last two issues  MuscleMedia
18	While Bill Phillips has put together  very basic fitness program that will  effective for beginners   also providing dubious nutrition advice  OVER consumption  protein  not necessary  build  great body  (look  Arnold)  can lead  serious health problems (osteoporosis  heart disease etc)   also advocates the use  highly processed  supplements (his own  others) containing numerous chemicals such   aspartame ( invitation  cancer)   you want  great body AND great  long-term health follow  natural whole foods diet  With the money you'  save from buying supplements  other processed foods buy  gym membership  / the services   personal trainer
33	 certainly get the feeling that some  the negative  positive comments are based  how some individuals feel about Bill Phillips EAS &amp Myoplex etc- not honest reviews  this book have read the  every word  Body-for-LIFE  can highly recommend   Beyond the  motivational success stories  &quotcrossing the Abyss&quot sections  the main message  Body-for- LIFE  you can have  great body AND have   life too   accomplishes this brilliantly  providing specific exercise   nutrition strategies that you never outgrow   details HOW   exercise (rep--rep &amp minute--minute)  exactly how  when   eat  produce amazing results   For example:  ' commuted  work via  bicycle for months which    mundane chore  best --  until now    applied Bill' 20-minute-aerobic solution   bike ride  now   commute has become  20-minute-sweat producing-fat burning-super intense  workout that leaves  refreshed  ready  work  personal note   just completed round four  the transformation challenge using these  principles  The Training-for-LIFE chapter was published   previous  Muscle Media issue   sneak preview was  the internet   downloaded  the forms  followed the exercise exactly  outlined  Does  work?   You judge ' 36 years old   12 weeks  lost 31 lbs  fat   gained 15 lbs  lean muscle doing less than 4 hours/week  weight  training  cardio! Although  had seen many  the principles from the  book before  Muscle Media/EAS website etc  really liked the new stuff   hadn' seen before: specific exercises authorized food lists menu  suggestions crossing the abyss  the glossary   plan  buying several  copies  this book  giving  out  people  care about the most   Enjoy!Note: ' never met Bill Phillips  ' not affiliated with EAS   any way   took the time  express  opinion because  have been  exposedto some principles that have literally changed  life for the  better   hope  can help influence others   the same
0	Okay there are obviously two camps that have reviewed this book  one hand people that have come   with  honest open mind  the other frustrated gym rats that are looking for another miracle workout   blast them into molecular dislocation The book  what  purports    folks  guideline  how  build  stronger mind  body   well  worth the price  admission

0	this   great source for anyone who wants  change their body this plan  simpleeffective   worksthe information contained  this book   formula for success thank you Bill
0	 think Bill Phillips book  really motivational  Actually   know  good deal about nutrition  exercise having tried numerous diet books  ' glad  see there are more positive reviews here now  Many people said   was  straight  for his supplements Obviously they had not read the  book - yes  mentions Myoplex his shake but that' about    also  adds that you can receive the same benefits without using the shake  '  been trying  use the creatine/HMB combo powder some   think  helps  some  prevent sore muscles after your workout far  whether  not  this  only for the beginner  think its great for people who need  real  plan laid out   really like having  structure   couple  forms   review  stick  (call   nerd - that' jsut  personality!)     you like  lot  structure  need some motivation this book  for you!
1	 was truly disapointed  Bill Phillips' book   was expecting some new revelation that would motivate   work out   did not move   all   thought some  the stories were good but the training methods were stuff  you could find anywhere   take the EAS products  they are fantastic   Overall this book was  quick read  not worth the price  Get    your local library for the stories
3	The sad truth  that  very large part  the population  obese  don' work out  all  The methods  this book are nothing out  the ordinary  way  easy  simple for anyone that knows anything about  being fit  The obese  out  shape people will reach the same  not  better results  doing virtually any exercise  When you are  that poor  condition whatever you  will improve your pathetic shape   you have  any experience  all  working out don' buy this book   '  waste   time
0	This book  excellent for those people who are new  fitness--especially those who have been trying for years  who just can' seem  get  together-- want  proven formula for getting  shape   disagree that   Phillips uses this book   advertisement for his company--yes   mentions one  his products briefly but  don' consider  couple pages    book   hard sell   simply states that  you' unable   adequately prepare six meals  day using  meal-replacement powder will  help  (And whose products did you want him  endorse--his competitors'?    doubt any person  business would  that!)  ' unfortunate that   great deal   fellow reviewers have obviously not read one page  this  book (otherwise their reviews would  least have  accurate description   the content  the book) they may just have learned something   Although ' likely that  number  the good reviews were written   colleagues   Phillips  believe ' even more likely that  good  majority  the bad reviews were written  disgruntled  employees who  can' stand the thought  being left behind  someone who will always   more successful than they will ever 
1	Excellent!  Very helpful for those   who have tried  failed  get  shape  you' tried  failed  get  shape this book could very well give you the information you' looking  for--the rest    you

4	' not  harsh  critic  many others  Bill Phillips' methods  training advice  fact  was quite  avid reader  Muscle Media until the magazine became  souped  supplement catalogue  ceased offering  the extremely useful training advice  once did   46 year old who has  been traing relatively intensely  consistently for the past twenty  years  found the book' recomendations  terms  weight training pretty  effective   change  pace  particularly agree with his observation  that too many trainees spend WAY too much time  the gym doing too many  sets  inviting more catabolism than anabolism The real argument  have   that the advice  aerobics the &quottwenty minute aerobic  solution&quot might work for some people but  certainly does not for    have  genetic predisposition  gain  lot  weight  ' not  careful with  diet  consistent with  aerobic exercise   have  progressed into  40' this tendency has been exacerbated  the natural  metabolic slowdown caused  aging  order  lose bodyfat  need    more than the recommendations  the book terms  aerobic exercise  even when  use the interval method described (  use  stairmaster    first thing  the morning   empty stomach etc etc  this  still  the case)  believe that   not the only person out there who   this  position being  &quothard loser&quot ( fat) rather than  &quothard  gainer&quot ( muscle)  would find this fat loss advice  major flaw   the regimen The other aspect that troubles   the product pushing  which while understanable  certainly justified from  business  perspective casts the book   somewhat negative lightperhaps unfairly  but ' there nonetheless ' like  see   depth addition  the  book which explains how you can accomplish the same results using food  rather than supplements (maybe this  not possible but  really kind   doubtit)  but  know that from  business standpoint that would  sort   foolish  would however   wonderful help  those   aspiring   the lifestyle  goals that  Phillips espouses who  not have $200  per month available  spend  monthly supplementation   however  find criticism  the book proceeds going  the &quotMake--Wish&quot  foundation  bit cynical  say the least Paul Newman donates the proceeds  from his food products (not his main source  income)  similar charities    one reads cynical manipulation into this You can criticize Bill  Phillips' training advice  product hawking   have but any  contribution  charity  makes  probably way more than many  his  critics have bothered  make  let'  focus  that which deserves  criticism  give  Phillips his due for  least BEING  charitable--something all too few people even bother trying   nowadays

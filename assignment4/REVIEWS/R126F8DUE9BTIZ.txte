I have since read it daily, and grown more appreciative of what i have.  I am also learn to take on les  say no more, and do what i really value do   It hasn't been a perfect road; I spent last night build a little organizer th that i don't really ne   In any case, thi book ha help me to make these change    <br /> <br />The book ha help me to view what' important to me, and it ha help me see what God want me to do with my life.

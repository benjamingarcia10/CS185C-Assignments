Thi book wa publish   1973,     wa written     \\"current events\\" book, so   ha little relevance   today' reader.  At least,   far   current event go.  The player  coache  front office people   the owner   all long gone,   retir or decea <br /><br />However,     still worth read     history book.  You   learn   lot   the working   the R Sox,   read some   the storie that today' Sox fan       heard before. Most fan know that Boston       first crack   Jackie Robinson   Willie May    those tale   relay again here. But other  like the racism   the scout department, or the way     prospect advanc through the system, were new to  .<br /><br />I   say thi book   interest only the diehard R Sox fan, or   seriou fan   baseball history   general.  Other   likely to lose interest fairly quickly.

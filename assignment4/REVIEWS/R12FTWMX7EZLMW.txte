Thi book wa publish in 1973, and it wa written a a \\"current events\\" book, so it ha little relevance for today' reader.  At least, a far a current event go.  The player  coache  front office people and the owner are all long gone, either retir or decea <br /><br />However, it i still worth read a a history book.  You can learn a lot about the working of the R Sox, and read some of the storie that today' Sox fan may not have heard before. Most fan know that Boston may have had first crack at Jackie Robinson and Willie May  and those tale are relay again here. But other  like the racism of the scout department, or the way in which prospect advanc through the system, were new to me.<br /><br />I would say thi book would interest only the diehard R Sox fan, or a seriou fan of baseball history in general.  Other are likely to lose interest fairly quickly.

A the title of my review say thi book i intend for all the people who want to architect and develop web service in a proper way. The technology around Web Service i very splitt  I mean from a lot of separate web association  When you want to master web service technology you have to know in detail XML, XML Schema, SOAP, UDDI and it support in J2EE.  <br />Thi book give architectual overview how these technologie depend on each other, I mean the relationship  <br />The book i not intend for gett detail information about source code implementation. Anyway, it i from the SUN Blueprint program team. So everybody develop and architectur web service with J2EE technology should read thi book. It i a very dry book. Very talkative. I am glad I have already read it.

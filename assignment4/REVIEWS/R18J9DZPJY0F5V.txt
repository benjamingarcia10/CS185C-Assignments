Thi book(more like   300 page tabloid) run abound   historical error  First   all,   say Evita wa two   her father di   she wa six. Secondly,   ha her gett Peron out   prison     wa labor worker that   that. <br /> <br />Also, the author claim to know what Evita felt. I concur   the above reviewer that, she make Evita out to     INHUMAN MONSTER, capable   only one emotion-gre  In fact, on page 35, she write \\"perhap the only real emotion she   feel wa hate.\\"  <br /> <br />Throughout the whole book Eva   made out to   on the same level     Hitler,   all her accomplishment   discredit  On pg 236, she write \\"It wa Eva,   Peron,     the fanaticism     Hitler.\\" Forgive  ,     Hitler     foundation   sick children? Evita personally kis   HELPED the poor, filthy, leper  those suffer   cancer,   STD  Under the Eva Peron Foundation,   the first time, there wa no inequality   Argenine Health Care. <br /> <br />I   recommend thi to the DIE hard Evita fan(like myself) so   get the ANTI-PERONIST view   Evita. For those   want to know the REAL Evita, I recommend Evita:The Real Life   Eva Peron   Fraser   Navarro. Also recommen   Alicia Dujove Orviz' Eva Peron, Toma Eloy Martinez' Santa Evita   the Peron Novel,   Robert Crassweller' Peron   the Enigma   Argentina. These   far more objective than thi 300 page tabloid.

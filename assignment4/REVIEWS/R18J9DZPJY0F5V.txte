Thi book(more like a 300 page tabloid) run abound with historical error  First of all, it say Evita wa two when her father di when she wa six. Secondly, it ha her gett Peron out of prison when it wa labor worker that did that. <br /> <br />Also, the author claim to know what Evita felt. I concur with the above reviewer that, she make Evita out to be an INHUMAN MONSTER, capable of only one emotion-gre  In fact, on page 35, she write \\"perhap the only real emotion she could feel wa hate.\\"  <br /> <br />Throughout the whole book Eva i made out to be on the same level a a Hitler, and all her accomplishment are discredit  On pg 236, she write \\"It wa Eva, not Peron, who had the fanaticism of a Hitler.\\" Forgive me, but did Hitler have a foundation for sick children? Evita personally kis and HELPED the poor, filthy, leper  those suffer from cancer, and STD  Under the Eva Peron Foundation, for the first time, there wa no inequality in Argenine Health Care. <br /> <br />I do recommend thi to the DIE hard Evita fan(like myself) so you get the ANTI-PERONIST view of Evita. For those who want to know the REAL Evita, I recommend Evita:The Real Life of Eva Peron by Fraser and Navarro. Also recommen are Alicia Dujove Orviz' Eva Peron, Toma Eloy Martinez' Santa Evita and the Peron Novel, and Robert Crassweller' Peron and the Enigma of Argentina. These are far more objective than thi 300 page tabloid.

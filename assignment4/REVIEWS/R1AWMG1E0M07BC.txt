I love the wxWidget book. Informative, well outlin        excellent index   plenty   information   new wx programmer or people   ha been u wx   awhile. <br /> <br />I   written several wxWidget app prior to buy the book,     learn many new technique to improve   newer program       better understand     the wx API work  the doc     alway clear. <br /> <br />My only complaint     lack   XRC information. It   barely touch upon though I find   crucial     program requir more than   extremely basic GUI. No one want to integrate C++ code generat   other program into their code-base. None   the program   ever likely to generate code that conform to   cod style,     XRC,     compile   GUI code into   array   never worry    . <br /> <br />The one plu   XRC though wa   discussion   the wxrc compiler   I hadn't known   before the book. Thi wa   big help   remov   XRC file     app distribution      problematic   cross-platform development. Now that I   compile them into   code, thing   much nicer   easier. <br /> <br />If     look   help   XRC   XRC only, avoid thi book. Otherwise, buy   quickly. You won't   disappoint

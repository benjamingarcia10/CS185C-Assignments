I love the wxWidget book. Informative, well outlin  and with an excellent index with plenty of information for new wx programmer or people who ha been u wx for awhile. <br /> <br />I had written several wxWidget app prior to buy the book, but have learn many new technique to improve my newer program and have a better understand of how the wx API work  the doc are not alway clear. <br /> <br />My only complaint i a lack of XRC information. It i barely touch upon though I find it crucial for any program requir more than an extremely basic GUI. No one want to integrate C++ code generat by other program into their code-base. None of the program are ever likely to generate code that conform to your cod style, but with XRC, you can compile your GUI code into an array and never worry about it. <br /> <br />The one plu in XRC though wa it discussion of the wxrc compiler which I hadn't known about before the book. Thi wa a big help in remov my XRC file from my app distribution  which are problematic in cross-platform development. Now that I can compile them into my code, thing are much nicer and easier. <br /> <br />If you are look for help with XRC and XRC only, avoid thi book. Otherwise, buy it quickly. You won't be disappoint

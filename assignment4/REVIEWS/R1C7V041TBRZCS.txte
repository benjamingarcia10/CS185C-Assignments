Thi book i so different, so astound  that it defie catagorization. The concept of analyz ancient legend and folk tale to reveal the inner nature of women and the pattern in womens' live felt revolutionary to me when I first sat down with thi book.  But then, a I read each segment and digest the author' analysi and correlation with typical life pattern experienc by women, I realiz that she tapp into truth which are a ancient a the folk tale and legend themselve   Beside that, she i one of the most ELOQUENT writer I've ever had the pleasure to read.  Her observation and their result lesson are so profound, so insightful they take my breath away at time   I just have to sit back, take a deep breath, shake my head and reread the section that just overwhelm me. <br /> <br />My favorite are \\"Skeleton Woman\\" and \\"Baubo the Belly Goddess\\". I don't want to give away any surprise .. so just get thi wonderful book and read these chapter for yourself!  I've read it straight through, and then gone back to re-experience my favorite chapter   Thi book can be enjoy either way!  I would so love to meet thi woman at a booksign

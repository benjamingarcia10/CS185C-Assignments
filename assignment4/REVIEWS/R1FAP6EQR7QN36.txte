There' now a movie \\"Grizzly Man\\" ba on the author own video  where you can see and hear the author himself. A a party game, try and count how many time he mention \\"dy for these <br />bears\\". Obses with bear  Perhap  Obses with dy  Ye  <br />Unfortunately the movie producer decid *not* to add the final video (actually audio a it appear the girlfriend didn&#8217;t have time totake the len cap off) of thi idiot final moment   I think thi sanitize a horrible and stupid death which i precisely the lesson people should take from thi man&#8217; life. Sadly he manag to get hi girlfri kill a she attempt to save hi life. &#65279;Apparently the author chang hi mind about dy for the bear at the last moment. &#65279;With incredibly bravery she apparently attempt to drive the bear away, lo her own life in the proces    <br /> <br />Interestingly the movie' website compare it to \\" Into Thin Air and Into the Wild\\" both book about how reality will turn around and bite you . <br /> <br /> Book and movie are perfect for home or school to show children what happen to stupid, careles or ignorant people.  Better for them to learn from other people mistake than end up dead or crippl  Or worse, take a friend with them. U copie of all these book are easily found and a must give to your school or family member

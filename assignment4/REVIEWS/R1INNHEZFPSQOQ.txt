<br />There   very few book describ   to practically use RUP   enterprise-scale development.  From experience, I found that RUP     vast --   overwhelm -- proces        necessary   architect   developer to customize their own RUP-ba simplifi proces  or     software project won't get anywhere u the full RUP approach. <br /> <br />The book   well written.  My only complaint   that   err  occasionally, on the side   academic   betray   vocation       practical engineer guide.

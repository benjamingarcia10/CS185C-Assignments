<br />There are very few book describ how to practically use RUP with enterprise-scale development.  From experience, I found that RUP i a vast -- and overwhelm -- proces  and it i necessary for architect and developer to customize their own RUP-ba simplifi proces  or else a software project won't get anywhere u the full RUP approach. <br /> <br />The book i well written.  My only complaint i that it err  occasionally, on the side of academic and betray it vocation of be a practical engineer guide.

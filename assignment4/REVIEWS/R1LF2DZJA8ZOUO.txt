On January 25, 1989, I read Champ Clark' My Quarter Century    <br />American Politic   much interest.  He refer to similar book   Thoma Hart Benton (Thirty Year View), Jame G. Blaine (Twenty Year   Congress),   thi book   George F. Hoar,   book serv Clark     model   hi book.  John Sherman   ha   memoir on hi year    even Champ Clark say Sherman'   dull.  I   now read Hoar' book   found   discursive     lot   interest thing scatter through   over 900 page   Incidentally, Hoar say John Sherman     write the Sherman Anti-Trust Act   1890    probably never read  !  He relate   care   affection the year   hi grow up,   the tremendou contrast between liv   the 1820   1903--  hi book wa written.  (He di the year after   wa publish )  He talk   lot   Senator   judge he knew,   nearly all hi comment   laudatory,   make them   too attention-hold   The exception   Ben Butler.  He ha much bad to say   Ben Butler, though he doe name five thing   him   he say were praiseworthy.  But these thing   overwhelm   the bad thing he ha to say   him.  Since so much   the book laud folk,       pleasant change   pace to read him excoriat somebody!  Hoar   wise thing to say   the folly   the US conquer the Phillipine    I found hi belief that the US should set   peaceful example   freedom   mankind     glad to follow pertinent, inasmuch   he add that we should never force even freedom upon unwill nation   the point     bayonet or   the cannon' mouth. While Iraq remind u   Vietnam,   closer parallel     to the US experience   the Phillipine    we insist that we should conquer the \\"natives\\" so we   make them able to govern themselve   Hoar believ they     been able to govern themselve   u forc them to submit to our instruction,   hi word sound wisetoday. While I lik Champ Clark' book more, that     due to the fact that hi politic were     antithetical to   inclination   were Hoar'

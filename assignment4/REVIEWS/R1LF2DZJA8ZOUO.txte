On January 25, 1989, I read Champ Clark' My Quarter Century of  <br />American Politic with much interest.  He refer to similar book by Thoma Hart Benton (Thirty Year View), Jame G. Blaine (Twenty Year in Congress), and thi book by George F. Hoar, which book serv Clark a a model for hi book.  John Sherman also ha a memoir on hi year  but even Champ Clark say Sherman' i dull.  I have now read Hoar' book and found it discursive but with lot of interest thing scatter through it over 900 page   Incidentally, Hoar say John Sherman did not write the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890  and probably never read it!  He relate with care and affection the year of hi grow up, and the tremendou contrast between liv in the 1820 and 1903--when hi book wa written.  (He di the year after it wa publish )  He talk a lot about Senator and judge he knew, and nearly all hi comment are laudatory, which make them not too attention-hold   The exception i Ben Butler.  He ha much bad to say about Ben Butler, though he doe name five thing about him which he say were praiseworthy.  But these thing are overwhelm by the bad thing he ha to say about him.  Since so much of the book laud folk, it i a pleasant change of pace to read him excoriat somebody!  Hoar had wise thing to say about the folly of the US conquer the Phillipine  and I found hi belief that the US should set a peaceful example of freedom which mankind will be glad to follow pertinent, inasmuch a he add that we should never force even freedom upon unwill nation at the point of a bayonet or at the cannon' mouth. While Iraq remind u of Vietnam, a closer parallel might be to the US experience in the Phillipine  where we insist that we should conquer the \\"natives\\" so we could make them able to govern themselve   Hoar believ they would have been able to govern themselve without u forc them to submit to our instruction, and hi word sound wisetoday. While I lik Champ Clark' book more, that may be due to the fact that hi politic were not a antithetical to my inclination a were Hoar'

I   recently discover that I love the travel book genre. And thi one     disappoint! It wa   pleasure to read   Catharine' adventure  She decid to man-haul to the South Pole     way to escape     life   pattern she wa   happy  . Man-haul mean pull   sl carry   own gear   the help   dog or snowmobile or anyth like that. It' quite   challenge   someone       athletically inclin    she wa forc to find grit   determination she didn't know she     her. <br /> <br />Another   Catharine' goal wa to purge several personality flaw that she saw   herself   didn't like. At first, I couldn't understand   walk to the pole wa go to help her change some seemingly irrelevant character habit  But, sure enough, she felt that they dissolv dur her time walk acros the ice. Hav practically noth to think   day after day   trudg along gave her plenty   time   introspection   she wa able to change herself. I usually prefer more action   les introspection   book like thi    these bit were fine. <br /> <br />A Catharine   definitely     writer, I   forgive some   the flaw   her narrative. (Although she   recruit the help     ghost writer.) The story seem   bit skippy sometime   occasionally name or event popp up that were   really introduc or explain  The most glar example wa the appearance   her tree surgeon friend. Although he wa   all that important to the story, she   imply that she   or want   relatively important relationship   him,     wa never really clear. Another example: A far   I   tell, she began call the old-time polar explorer 'beards' part way through the book. That wa really cute! But     seem to appear   nowhere. She probably should   made   slightly bigger th   that,     wa important to the title. The book' choppines level increa greatly near the end. But   didn't keep     enjoy   read  <br /> <br />I wish she   spent   little more time on her trip to the North Pole. Her description   the ice formation   phenomenon were fascinat  I     lov to learn more   them. <br /> <br />A fun, excit read.  Worth   time. <br />

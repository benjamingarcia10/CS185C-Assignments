I have recently discover that I love the travel book genre. And thi one did not disappoint! It wa a pleasure to read about Catharine' adventure  She decid to man-haul to the South Pole a a way to escape from a life whose pattern she wa not happy with. Man-haul mean pull a sl carry your own gear without the help of dog or snowmobile or anyth like that. It' quite a challenge for someone who i not athletically inclin  and she wa forc to find grit and determination she didn't know she had in her. <br /> <br />Another of Catharine' goal wa to purge several personality flaw that she saw in herself and didn't like. At first, I couldn't understand how walk to the pole wa go to help her change some seemingly irrelevant character habit  But, sure enough, she felt that they dissolv dur her time walk acros the ice. Hav practically noth to think about day after day while trudg along gave her plenty of time for introspection and she wa able to change herself. I usually prefer more action and les introspection in book like thi  but these bit were fine. <br /> <br />A Catharine i definitely not a writer, I can forgive some of the flaw in her narrative. (Although she did recruit the help of a ghost writer.) The story seem a bit skippy sometime and occasionally name or event popp up that were not really introduc or explain  The most glar example wa the appearance of her tree surgeon friend. Although he wa not all that important to the story, she did imply that she had or want a relatively important relationship with him, but it wa never really clear. Another example: A far a I could tell, she began call the old-time polar explorer 'beards' part way through the book. That wa really cute! But it just seem to appear from nowhere. She probably should have made a slightly bigger th of that, a it wa important to the title. The book' choppines level increa greatly near the end. But it didn't keep me from enjoy my read  <br /> <br />I wish she had spent a little more time on her trip to the North Pole. Her description of the ice formation and phenomenon were fascinat  I would have lov to learn more about them. <br /> <br />A fun, excit read.  Worth your time. <br />

When I first receiv the book I wa skeptical about what I wa about to read.I thought thi wa another male bash type of book.  I must say I wa totally wrong.  I can say that read the book I got involv with all the character   Thi book main character were actually bash themselve mentally. You watch character grow from their mistake and wa so happy to see it.  I do think that Ezekiel still  had away to go in hi growth.  The book show what some women will accept in a relationship on the assumtion that they are lov  The women character Betty Jean and Carla learn and realiz love i more just say it but show it.  I highly rccomend thi book not only to women to men a well. Thi i not just another chick novel.

In thi book, Admiral Lockwood report on the role of fleet submarine in air rescue operation in the Pacific dur WWII.  Unfortunately, he glorifie the best & glosse over the worst. He write  \\"The defect in our Mark XIV torpeoe were seriou  but they were correct in a few month and in a manner that reflect great credit upon the clever, determin youngster who sweat out the answer \\" (P. 7).  The defect weren't correct in a few month  and the youngster seek answer were sweat because they were operat at the edge of their order   Although he wa actively try to clear up the torpoedo problem  Lockwood doesn't report what he knew or did or who wa stand in hi way.  Nor doe he place responsibility where he think it belong   He i too busy \\"reflect great credit\\" to evaluate critically.  For example, in discus co-operation with bomber command, he write  \\"I experienc only two case wherein hard-boil Air General were lukewarm and refu to co-operate.  Their name are of no importance now.\\" (P. 201) Their name ARE of importance now, and Lockwood doesn't mention them.  Then there are game the book play  such a declin to report the periscope depth of a fleet submarine, for security reason  while report that the sub can't dive inside the ten fathom line.  Do the math.  Then there' the problem of co-authorship. Someone tri to be colorful; I doubt it wa the Admiral.  The result i that the Admiral' personality doesn't come through, except in the last chapter, perhap   What we have here i a compendium of rescue  cull from combat report  by an Admiral committ to cultivat hi own professional reputation by not offend anybody.  In short, a good summary of deed by brave men, includ the rescue of George Bush, Sr., but with little entertainment or historical value, except for the lesson that one doe not become an Admiral by offend peer

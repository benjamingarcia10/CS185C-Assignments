My job require   to write script on Window   Unix platform   I   no problem writ Window batch file or Unix shell script to copy or move file  change permission  create   delete directorie  write result to log file  etc. <br /> <br />Recently, I wa ask to write   mainframe script.  I wa told to write thi script   Rexx.  When I look into Rexx,   wa   another script language.  It wa   hard to understand     work   However, unlike Window batch file or Unix shell script  there wa more to writ   Rexx program than   know the Rexx language - I need JCL to run  !!  I   seen JCL before.  I knew   job start     JOB card   that   execut PROC   PGM   I   knew that I     know nearly enough   JCL to write JCL to   what I want   to  .  That'   I went to Amazon   found thi book. <br /> <br />Not only   thi book confirm what little I   know   correct some misundertanding I  ,   went far more deeply into JCL to describe   to use many feature that I     know exist   One   the best feature   thi book   that   provide some background information on   mainframe work   the nam convention u   Thi information   useful   JCL cod   introduc because the reader ha   better idea   what the JCL   u     what   happen   the variou statement   JCL cod     even introduc until Chapter 4!! <br /> <br />After the background information, thi book then goe through the variou aspect   JCL cod   The basic   what I need to know to run   Rexx program were addres   were many concept that I   now put     \\"bag   tricks\\"   future project   I   sure most   our mainframe programmer     know most   thi material. <br /> <br />Thi book     limit to JCL.  It   describe   to compile Cobol program    to copy, move, sort, delete   print dataset u common mainframe utilitie   It even ha achapter on Unix System Service   Prior to read these chapter  I   no idea   to copy   dataset to   new dataset on the mainframe u   batch program.  For  , thi wa   trivial issue on   Window or Unix platform.  I now know   to     on the mainframe.  Thi book clearly explain the proces   It   provide cod example   all concept describ throughout the book. <br /> <br />If     new to comput  I don't think   want to start   the mainframe   the first platform   learn.  However,       some comput background   work   Window   Unix, then I highly recommend thi book to get   solid foundation on   to run batch program on the mainframe. <br /> <br />In the past, I   to ask   coworker to help     I need to work   JCL.  I purcha thi book so that I   code some JCL   myself to run   Rexx program.  Now,   only doe   Rexx program execute flawlessly, I       thorough understand     to write mainframe batch program   future project   Who know      coworker   start com to     their complex JCL cod problem ! <br />

My job require me to write script on Window and Unix platform   I have no problem writ Window batch file or Unix shell script to copy or move file  change permission  create and delete directorie  write result to log file  etc. <br /> <br />Recently, I wa ask to write a mainframe script.  I wa told to write thi script in Rexx.  When I look into Rexx, it wa just another script language.  It wa not hard to understand how it work   However, unlike Window batch file or Unix shell script  there wa more to writ a Rexx program than just know the Rexx language - I need JCL to run it!!  I had seen JCL before.  I knew each job start with a JOB card and that it execut PROC and PGM   I also knew that I did not know nearly enough about JCL to write JCL to do what I want it to do.  That' when I went to Amazon and found thi book. <br /> <br />Not only did thi book confirm what little I did know and correct some misundertanding I had, it went far more deeply into JCL to describe how to use many feature that I did not know exist   One of the best feature of thi book i that it provide some background information on how mainframe work and the nam convention u   Thi information i useful when JCL cod i introduc because the reader ha a better idea of what the JCL i u for and what it happen with the variou statement   JCL cod i not even introduc until Chapter 4!! <br /> <br />After the background information, thi book then goe through the variou aspect of JCL cod   The basic of what I need to know to run my Rexx program were addres a were many concept that I can now put in my \\"bag of tricks\\" for future project   I am sure most of our mainframe programmer do not know most of thi material. <br /> <br />Thi book i not limit to JCL.  It also describe how to compile Cobol program  how to copy, move, sort, delete and print dataset u common mainframe utilitie   It even ha achapter on Unix System Service   Prior to read these chapter  I had no idea how to copy a dataset to a new dataset on the mainframe u a batch program.  For me, thi wa a trivial issue on a Window or Unix platform.  I now know how to do it on the mainframe.  Thi book clearly explain the proces   It also provide cod example for all concept describ throughout the book. <br /> <br />If you are new to comput  I don't think you want to start with the mainframe a the first platform you learn.  However, if you have some comput background from work with Window and Unix, then I highly recommend thi book to get a solid foundation on how to run batch program on the mainframe. <br /> <br />In the past, I had to ask a coworker to help me when I need to work with JCL.  I purcha thi book so that I could code some JCL for myself to run my Rexx program.  Now, not only doe my Rexx program execute flawlessly, I also have a thorough understand of how to write mainframe batch program for future project   Who know  maybe my coworker will start com to me with their complex JCL cod problem ! <br />

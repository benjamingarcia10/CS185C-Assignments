Like wa already stat   another review, the section cover   to set the library   compiler   bad. It   show that wxwidget     ready   prime-time. Too many hour   wast   sett   up.    Other then that the book itself   pretty decent,     assume too much. First off, the book claim that   novice   use thi book   learn C++. Not likely. There   too many libertie taken, like putt the first example program     single file. How     novice suppo to know what goe   what header file? There   no excuse   poor programm practice  ever.    I think the book   easy to read,     well laid out. I       novice,         professional. I     honor student     senior year     computer science program, specializ   network security   real-time system  I   reasonably competant   assembly, c, c++   java. The book seem to   written   someone     experiance,   that goe against their claim     the book    . To the people   say thi book       beginner      correct. However, the stat audience   the book   novice to professional. That alway send up r flag    try to write to everyone   most     audience     left out   one point or another.    A key part mis     to make .exe reasonably small,   keep them efficient. wxWidget create some   the biggest executable     imagine. The first example program compile to 2.4 MB     debug exe     .v .net set to compile   size, the release exe   800KB!!! That   insane,   another sign that wxwidget     ready   prime-time. There   way around  ,   the book doesn't really mention the problem or   to fix  . I think the fact that the creator   the library   wrote the book,   the reason negative   the library     to overcome them wa left out. It   hard to   honestly critical     own work.    Overall, the book need   lot more polish   attention to detail. Too many assumption   what the reader   or     know make     uneven read. To   fair, the co-author Kevin Hock, admitt that   the section on sett   up wa   focu     goal on the main wxWidget message board  Another bonu   that he answer question on the message board,     pretty impressive. So obviously the author care   the book   subject, so the odd     revision clean up all the problem   the book   pretty good. If   ne to learn   cross-platform GUI library, I   recommend thi book over QT, even though the QT book   superior.    Find   decent cross-platform GUI library   rough. There   two main librarie    C++. QT, very slick   polish      small   efficient. A bit harder to learn then wxWidget   unles   want to   forc to release   work   open source,       to pay around $1600   the library, stupidly expensive. wxWidget  easy to learn,   very primitive. Beside the other problem already stat  the library doe   play nice   IDE'  With   new project   create,     to manually tell the compiler   to find the necessary .h   .lib file    other setting  An approv workaround   make   copy     prior project, so     all the setting  That   inexcusable   scream   unprofessionalism. It   free       release   work however   like   no royaltie  Given the difference    the superiority   QT, I   still recommend thi book   the wxWidget library. Hav the freedom to   what   like     creation     bonu that       overstat  Also Trolltech ha proven itself to   greedy   arrogant. For $1600,     get   lot   professional programm tool  that doe far more then what QT offer        what   like     creation

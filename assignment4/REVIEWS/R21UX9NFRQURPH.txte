Like wa already stat in another review, the section cover how to set the library with compiler i bad. It also show that wxwidget i not ready for prime-time. Too many hour are wast just sett it up.    Other then that the book itself i pretty decent, but it assume too much. First off, the book claim that a novice could use thi book while learn C++. Not likely. There are too many libertie taken, like putt the first example program in a single file. How i a novice suppo to know what goe in what header file? There i no excuse for poor programm practice  ever.    I think the book i easy to read, and i well laid out. I am not a novice, but not yet a professional. I am an honor student in my senior year of my computer science program, specializ in network security and real-time system  I am reasonably competant in assembly, c, c++ and java. The book seem to be written for someone of my experiance, but that goe against their claim of who the book i for. To the people who say thi book i not for beginner  you are correct. However, the stat audience of the book i novice to professional. That alway send up r flag  you try to write to everyone and most of your audience will be left out at one point or another.    A key part mis i how to make .exe reasonably small, while keep them efficient. wxWidget create some of the biggest executable you can imagine. The first example program compile to 2.4 MB a a debug exe and with .v .net set to compile for size, the release exe i 800KB!!! That i insane, and another sign that wxwidget i not ready for prime-time. There are way around it, but the book doesn't really mention the problem or how to fix it. I think the fact that the creator of the library also wrote the book, i the reason negative about the library and how to overcome them wa left out. It i hard to be honestly critical of your own work.    Overall, the book need a lot more polish and attention to detail. Too many assumption about what the reader might or might not know make it an uneven read. To be fair, the co-author Kevin Hock, admitt that maybe the section on sett it up wa not focu in it goal on the main wxWidget message board  Another bonu i that he answer question on the message board, which i pretty impressive. So obviously the author care about the book and subject, so the odd of a revision clean up all the problem in the book are pretty good. If you ne to learn a cross-platform GUI library, I would recommend thi book over QT, even though the QT book i superior.    Find a decent cross-platform GUI library i rough. There are two main librarie  for C++. QT, very slick and polish  and i small and efficient. A bit harder to learn then wxWidget and unles you want to be forc to release your work a open source, you will have to pay around $1600 for the library, stupidly expensive. wxWidget  easy to learn, but very primitive. Beside the other problem already stat  the library doe not play nice with IDE'  With each new project you create, you have to manually tell the compiler where to find the necessary .h and .lib file  and other setting  An approv workaround i make a copy of a prior project, so you have all the setting  That i inexcusable and scream of unprofessionalism. It i free and you can release your work however you like with no royaltie  Given the difference  and the superiority of QT, I would still recommend thi book and the wxWidget library. Hav the freedom to do what you like with your creation i a bonu that can not be overstat  Also Trolltech ha proven itself to be greedy and arrogant. For $1600, you can get a lot of professional programm tool  that doe far more then what QT offer  and can do what you like with your creation

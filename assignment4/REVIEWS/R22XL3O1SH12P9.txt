Thi book wa co-author   the creator   wxwidget (Julian Smart). Thi raise the spector     great deal   promise   peril. Promise because   the creator, he know hi creation better than most   so   lead   through the more arcane sidestreet  peril because   the creator he   too close to hi creation     assume hi reader know hi creation too well   thereby make many assumption, so explanation     'reminding'   exposition. He navigate these water reaosnably well. <br /> <br />The CD contain   great deal   useful software (  don't expect too much accessible guidance on   to use     wxwidgets-> particularly the open source software-> minGW, open watcom, etc...    very ironic! since we   u open source because     open source   wxwidget   open source...  there seem to   little attempt   really work say minGW studio   wxwidget together, event though minGW studio wa built   wxwdigets-> minGW studio even contain   option to make   wxwidget project ->  that doesn't work. Left hand   the right hand aren't work toegther too well so   seem ..  I digress) <br /> <br />However   aware that     ne to   familiar   the     out     respective compiler to use wxwidget  Compare thi   C++ GUI Programm   Qt 3(isbn: 0131240722)    'll notice   obviou difference. The QT book provide first up   walk through     to compile   only their example     own. You   told   to set path    to build, etc. Thi book show     to compile their sample    leave   hang     own (perhap we   suppo to modiy their ?).  They   talk   visual studio (old   .net -> ironic     open source project     beg the question,   I   those,   the hell   I use wxwidget   GUI programm ?? particularly   I   use QT or Kdevelop on linux   well? Though Trolltech seemingly ha end the honeypot usage   QT     charg       window development->   we're look   wxwidget instead I assume). So     ne to   well ver   the arcana     compiler   know   makefile   workspace   so forth. DOn't expect too much useful guidance here. Now thi     frustrat because    're look to use wxwidget  're probably want to make someth  so   want to get into         to troll thorugh masse   documentation to get compilage     work. Prepare   documentation->  ,    're like  , mean  'll persist     couple   hour   then think to hell   thi ..Which   disappoint because   taint thi forever. Of course    're   tinkerer, then thi     fun...    masochistic sort   way...I'm     tinkerer,   I don't like wast time play around   compiler   software...I want immediate functionality-> install   use. Thi doe   give   that I'm afraid. <br /> <br />Personally I don't think thi book   ready   prime time (  novice should   able to pick   up   get start     minimum   fus  I think   doe ne to clean up the whole compil mes (    seriou mes      they seem to forget the truism:   try to   all thing to everybody,   end up   noth to anyone). The content   great   they ne to take   look   the QT book (  the same bruce peren serie !!!)   see   to document the proces   build   project   compil  . <br /> <br />Therein lie the problem: I   never u wxwdiget so I     novice to   particular idiosyncracie  I       novice programmer-> hav done the java, c, c++, c# th   quite some year  However...thi book doe ne to   more friendly toward those   u   use programm tool     purpose,   because we don't     life or treat   tool   the end   itself rather than   mean to someth   ( 've got better thing to   then   to wade through compiler documentation to get someth to functiona   should-> that' somebody  ' job)...I fail to see   thi (the timewast   inefficiencie to get functionality out    ) make   more productive   therefore   influence   choice to pursue wxwidget ??  <br />

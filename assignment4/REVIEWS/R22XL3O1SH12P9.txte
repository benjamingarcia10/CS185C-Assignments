Thi book wa co-author by the creator of wxwidget (Julian Smart). Thi raise the spector of a great deal of promise and peril. Promise because a the creator, he know hi creation better than most and so can lead you through the more arcane sidestreet  peril because a the creator he i too close to hi creation and can assume hi reader know hi creation too well and thereby make many assumption, so explanation become about 'reminding' not exposition. He navigate these water reaosnably well. <br /> <br />The CD contain a great deal of useful software (but don't expect too much accessible guidance on how to use it with wxwidgets-> particularly the open source software-> minGW, open watcom, etc...which i very ironic! since we are u open source because it i open source and wxwidget i open source...but there seem to be little attempt at really work say minGW studio and wxwidget together, event though minGW studio wa built with wxwdigets-> minGW studio even contain a option to make a wxwidget project ->but that doesn't work. Left hand and the right hand aren't work toegther too well so it seem ..but I digress) <br /> <br />However be aware that you may ne to be familiar with the in and out of you respective compiler to use wxwidget  Compare thi with C++ GUI Programm with Qt 3(isbn: 0131240722) and you'll notice an obviou difference. The QT book provide first up a walk through of how to compile not only their example but your own. You are told how to set path  how to build, etc. Thi book show you how to compile their sample  but leave you hang with you own (perhap we are suppo to modiy their ?).  They do talk about visual studio (old and .net -> ironic for an open source project and which beg the question, if I had those, why the hell would I use wxwidget for GUI programm ?? particularly when I can use QT or Kdevelop on linux a well? Though Trolltech seemingly ha end the honeypot usage of QT and i charg for it for window development-> hence we're look at wxwidget instead I assume). So you will ne to be well ver in the arcana of your compiler and know about makefile and workspace and so forth. DOn't expect too much useful guidance here. Now thi can be frustrat because if you're look to use wxwidget you're probably want to make someth  so you want to get into it and not have to troll thorugh masse of documentation to get compilage of your work. Prepare for documentation-> which, if you're like me, mean you'll persist for a couple of hour and then think to hell with thi ..Which i disappoint because it taint thi forever. Of course if you're a tinkerer, then thi could be fun...in a masochistic sort of way...I'm not a tinkerer, and I don't like wast time play around with compiler and software...I want immediate functionality-> install and use. Thi doe not give me that I'm afraid. <br /> <br />Personally I don't think thi book i ready for prime time (a novice should be able to pick it up and get start with a minimum of fus  I think it doe ne to clean up the whole compil mes (and a seriou mes it i  they seem to forget the truism: you try to be all thing to everybody, you end up be noth to anyone). The content are great but they ne to take a look at the QT book (from the same bruce peren serie !!!) and see how to document the proces of build a project and compil it. <br /> <br />Therein lie the problem: I have never u wxwdiget so I am a novice to it particular idiosyncracie  I am not a novice programmer-> hav done the java, c, c++, c# th for quite some year  However...thi book doe ne to be more friendly toward those of u who use programm tool for a purpose, not because we don't have a life or treat a tool a the end in itself rather than a mean to someth else (i've got better thing to do then have to wade through compiler documentation to get someth to functiona it should-> that' somebody else' job)...I fail to see how thi (the timewast and inefficiencie to get functionality out of it) make me more productive and therefore would influence my choice to pursue wxwidget ??  <br />

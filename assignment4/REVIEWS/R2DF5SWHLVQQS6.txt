I purcha   read thi book several year ago upon the prodd     friend     say that I wa very pleasantly surpri <br /><br />First   all, I   no Doctor, Chiropractor, etc.,   I   reason   think   Mr. Griner' premise make   heck   alot   sense!<br /><br />Why   so many people   continuou   recurr back   even body pain?  Why   the answer   the Chiropractor alway herniat disc  slipp disc  subluxation  etc., etc.   utilize the one-size-fits-all treatment includ the standard   continuou \\"cracking\\"   the neck   twist the spine?  I happen to feel that all thi \\"cracking\\", twist  pull ..the mov table  et al cause MORE spasm     probably the root problem to begin       the other way around.<br /><br />If the spasm     alleviat then the spine   straighten out due to the fact that the pain   cortort  . I've been through the pain   the femoral nerve that goe down the side   the leg to the knee   to the foot   so inflam  that the pain manifest itself only   the knee   I reach the point   I want to cut   leg off to get rid   the pain!  I   to hold   leg up - favor   - because I     walk    .  (Most people   pain tend to favor different area   the body     pain.) I finally found   chiropractor that insist that he     different treatment     help  .  He pres deep into the buttock   relea the spasm that wa cau the nerve to   pinch ...  thi   after 3 prior chiropractor made   pain worse!<br /><br />Mr. Griner, I   definitely say, ha someth here   I WISH that more Chiropractor  Osteopath  Physical Therapist   Massage Therapist   learn thi technique   truly help their patient alleviate their pain!<br /><br />Unfortunately some prior reviewer found issue   some   the illustration      or       correct,   I think   read thi book, the whole picture should   taken into account...that   what Mr. Griner' main point   picture should   taken into account...that   what Mr. Griner' main point

I purcha and read thi book several year ago upon the prodd of a friend and must say that I wa very pleasantly surpri <br /><br />First of all, I am no Doctor, Chiropractor, etc., but I can reason and think and Mr. Griner' premise make a heck of alot of sense!<br /><br />Why are so many people in continuou and recurr back and even body pain?  Why i the answer from the Chiropractor alway herniat disc  slipp disc  subluxation  etc., etc. and utilize the one-size-fits-all treatment includ the standard and continuou \\"cracking\\" of the neck and twist the spine?  I happen to feel that all thi \\"cracking\\", twist  pull ..the mov table  et al cause MORE spasm which i probably the root problem to begin with and not the other way around.<br /><br />If the spasm could be alleviat then the spine can straighten out due to the fact that the pain i cortort you. I've been through the pain with the femoral nerve that goe down the side of the leg to the knee and to the foot be so inflam  that the pain manifest itself only in the knee and I reach the point where I want to cut my leg off to get rid of the pain!  I had to hold my leg up - favor it - because I could not walk with it.  (Most people in pain tend to favor different area of the body when in pain.) I finally found a chiropractor that insist that he had a different treatment and could help me.  He pres deep into the buttock and relea the spasm that wa cau the nerve to be pinch ...but thi i after 3 prior chiropractor made my pain worse!<br /><br />Mr. Griner, I would definitely say, ha someth here and I WISH that more Chiropractor  Osteopath  Physical Therapist and Massage Therapist would learn thi technique and truly help their patient alleviate their pain!<br /><br />Unfortunately some prior reviewer found issue with some of the illustration  which may or may not be correct, but I think when read thi book, the whole picture should be taken into account...that i what Mr. Griner' main point i picture should be taken into account...that i what Mr. Griner' main point i

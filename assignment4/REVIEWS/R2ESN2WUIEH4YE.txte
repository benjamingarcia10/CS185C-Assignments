I like to learn about belief of other culture and people, and I wa curiou to learn about Rastafarianism.  I wa not satisfi with the information I obtain from thi book.  It touch on tidbit of Rastafarianism, and often sway from the main topic.  The point of view seem to be more opinionat rather than alot of hard solid fact   There would be mention of variou topic apart from actual Rastafarianism and those other topic would be ti in with Rastafarianism by a quote or someth   I really thought it would have been more in depth on Rastafarianism a a whole.

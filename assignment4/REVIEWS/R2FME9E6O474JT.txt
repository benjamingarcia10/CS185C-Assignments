I thought the concept   thi book wa good,     really annoy     time  Consider the dearth   storie that give bisexuality   seriou exploration, I thought   worth   try. It'     slow read,     wa terribly written. Cliche abound   grammatical error   frequent (        \\"poetic license\\" sort   way--they're   dumb mistakes). If  're only look     interest story,   the quality   writ doe   affect   read choice much, then thi       fun book to spend   afternoon  .

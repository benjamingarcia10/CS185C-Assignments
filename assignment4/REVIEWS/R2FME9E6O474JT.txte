I thought the concept for thi book wa good, but it really annoy me at time  Consider the dearth of storie that give bisexuality a seriou exploration, I thought it worth a try. It' not a slow read, but it wa terribly written. Cliche abound and grammatical error are frequent (and not in a \\"poetic license\\" sort of way--they're just dumb mistakes). If you're only look for an interest story, and the quality of writ doe not affect your read choice much, then thi would be a fun book to spend an afternoon with.

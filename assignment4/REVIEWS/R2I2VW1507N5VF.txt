Thi   one   the best book I   read     very long time. <br /> <br />I hesitat to buy   because I wa   familiar   the author <br /> , I'm so happy that I took the chance (someth I seldom  ) I   honestly say that, I   go so far   to search   more   her work,   wa   that good. <br /> <br />The story itself     regard to issue that we   all familiar  . While read   tend to fit   own Aunt  kid   Uncle , parent . etc. into the character mak the story   very personal one to the reader.  <br /> <br />Aside   all   that, there   constant mystery involv that   keep anyone turn the page until completion   the book. I put   down   kitchen trip only. Bathroom trip were WITH the book   hand,   well   the bedroom     Dr  office. <br /> <br />I     to compare the page turner style     DAN BROWN,  <br />  the storyline   compare more to   \\" A great big fat Greek Wedding\\" or     \\"Tuesday   Morrie\\"   Mitch Albom. <br /> <br />It wa touch  familiar, refresh     page turner all   one. <br /> <br />  Kudo'   Encore to the Author   the publisher   found her.

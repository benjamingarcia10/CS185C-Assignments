Thi i one of the best book I have read in a very long time. <br /> <br />I hesitat to buy it because I wa not familiar with the author <br />but, I'm so happy that I took the chance (someth I seldom do) I can honestly say that, I will go so far a to search for more of her work, it wa just that good. <br /> <br />The story itself i with regard to issue that we are all familiar with. While read you tend to fit your own Aunt  kid   Uncle , parent . etc. into the character mak the story a very personal one to the reader.  <br /> <br />Aside from all of that, there i constant mystery involv that would keep anyone turn the page until completion of the book. I put it down for kitchen trip only. Bathroom trip were WITH the book in hand, a well a the bedroom and my Dr  office. <br /> <br />I would have to compare the page turner style with a DAN BROWN,  <br />while the storyline would compare more to a \\" A great big fat Greek Wedding\\" or maybe a \\"Tuesday with Morrie\\" by Mitch Albom. <br /> <br />It wa touch  familiar, refresh and a page turner all in one. <br /> <br />  Kudo' and Encore to the Author and the publisher who found her.

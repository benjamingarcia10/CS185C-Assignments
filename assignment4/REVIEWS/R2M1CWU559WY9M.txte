Thi song wa one of my favorite sesame street clip when I wa a kid. I wa so happy to find that I could get the song on cd with the book. However, wa a little disappoint to find out that the cd version of the song i NOT the original 1982 version. But it' still a great song, with a great message of unity and peace, and I wa happy to finally have a copy of the song I could listen to over and over.

If   want to get go   Spr   I         download   start cod  read   simpler book or, like  , get stuck   to the mother load - thi book.  It ha even manag convinc   that there   some good, ahem, aspect to AOP. <br /> <br />The only th that I find dismal   Java / web programm  even   Spr    that the UI   still the biggest pain   all to develop.  Thi space   ha too many technologie   there     huge amount   churn.  Since the book Spr ha start to   integrat   AJAX   make the whole mix even more complex.  Keep u consultant   work   I   think   better way to add value than constantly re-writ the UI! <br /> <br />Enough blather    .  Thi     excellent book     grace the shelf     professional Java architect or developer.

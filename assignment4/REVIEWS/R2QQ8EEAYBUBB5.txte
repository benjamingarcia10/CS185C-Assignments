If you want to get go with Spr a I did you can just download and start cod  read a simpler book or, like me, get stuck in to the mother load - thi book.  It ha even manag convinc me that there are some good, ahem, aspect to AOP. <br /> <br />The only th that I find dismal about Java / web programm  even with Spr  i that the UI i still the biggest pain of all to develop.  Thi space just ha too many technologie and there i a huge amount of churn.  Since the book Spr ha start to become integrat with AJAX which make the whole mix even more complex.  Keep u consultant in work but I can think of better way to add value than constantly re-writ the UI! <br /> <br />Enough blather from me.  Thi i an excellent book and will grace the shelf of any professional Java architect or developer.

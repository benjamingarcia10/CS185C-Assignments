I love thi book. Maybe  ' the year   read  entertain    poorly written lesbian fiction; or   foray into the realm   non-fiction two year ago that' left   little time   new fiction,   thi book ha come up on   read agenda four time thi summer. Every time I move   to   bookshelf, I take   back off     week, to read again. <br /> <br />I'll say up front,   I   love TV show   movie   male/female romantic lead  I've never been the fan   read fiction   that sort. So   fictional read wa typically split between the more literary, like Alice Sebold' \\"The Lovely Bones\\" or the more prurient, such   Karin Kallmaker' \\"Paint Moon\\". So, I     heavily influenc   the unexpect lightnes   thi story. The prose     clean   fun. <br /> <br />Max Bland   the man. I love hi wit, hi attitude, hi insight into the human condition. H*ll,   the end   the book I even lov the description     peni  Danielle, the bisexual,   wonderfully drawn     modern, attractive,   very loveable, self-center woman. You know the type-they're so high maintenance,     happily give into giv them       their \\"needs\\"   to   them smile    .  And Katie, sigh, Katie. Katie     type   girl. Girl next door, self-sacrific  socially responsible, cool wit,   overly sanctimoniou    lesbian.  I   even forgive her   hav blonde curly hair, instead     preferr dark curly hair. <br /> <br />So       story   three enjoyable character   their road to becom   single family. I wa     the open line       rich make   horny (newly discover richnes that  );     order dinner decid   character   get to sleep   the Danielle. But mostly, I   lov that, I   sit on   front porch, rock   read,   feel incredibly happy that Sean David Wright happen to make   read list,   lament that thi   hi only book (  least available through Amazon). <br /> <br />I highly recommend  .

I love thi book. Maybe it' the year of read  entertain  but poorly written lesbian fiction; or my foray into the realm of non-fiction two year ago that' left me little time for new fiction, but thi book ha come up on my read agenda four time thi summer. Every time I move it to my bookshelf, I take it back off within a week, to read again. <br /> <br />I'll say up front, while I do love TV show and movie with male/female romantic lead  I've never been the fan of read fiction of that sort. So my fictional read wa typically split between the more literary, like Alice Sebold' \\"The Lovely Bones\\" or the more prurient, such a Karin Kallmaker' \\"Paint Moon\\". So, I might be heavily influenc by the unexpect lightnes of thi story. The prose i just clean and fun. <br /> <br />Max Bland i the man. I love hi wit, hi attitude, hi insight into the human condition. H*ll, by the end of the book I even lov the description of i peni  Danielle, the bisexual, i wonderfully drawn a a modern, attractive, and very loveable, self-center woman. You know the type-they're so high maintenance, but you happily give into giv them almost any of their \\"needs\\" just to have them smile at you.  And Katie, sigh, Katie. Katie i my type of girl. Girl next door, self-sacrific  socially responsible, cool wit, not overly sanctimoniou  and lesbian.  I can even forgive her for hav blonde curly hair, instead of my preferr dark curly hair. <br /> <br />So you have a story of three enjoyable character and their road to becom a single family. I wa in from the open line about how be rich make you horny (newly discover richnes that is); and how order dinner decid which character would get to sleep with the Danielle. But mostly, I just lov that, I could sit on my front porch, rock and read, and feel incredibly happy that Sean David Wright happen to make my read list, while lament that thi i hi only book (at least available through Amazon). <br /> <br />I highly recommend it.

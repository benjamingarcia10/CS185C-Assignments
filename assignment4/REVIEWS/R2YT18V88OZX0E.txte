Thi i a must read book.  You'll find yourself laugh out loud, a well a perhap find yourself in Max' shoe    Max doe a fine job of be able to handle two women who have feeling for one another.  Doe Max make thi a sexual type of situation?  No!  That' what I love about thi book.  He explore another side, which in today' society isn't view often.     He doe a good job of blend real life detail into hi fantasy story.  Even though the plot seem incredible, I think he doe a good job of mak the character believable, they seem just like people I know.      I believe Mr. Wright did a wonderful job writ thi novel.  I give him big kudo   I can't wait to read other novel if & when he doe publish them.

I read thi book   least five time     girl   sixteen (many, many year ago). It touch   very deeply   made   look   life     completely new perspective. Thi       typical kiddish book   teenage angst - the author' writ style   sofisticat   so descriptive that   draw   into the picture     feel      're really there (    taste the sea spray)!

I read thi book at least five time a a girl of sixteen (many, many year ago). It touch me very deeply and made me look at life from a completely new perspective. Thi i not a typical kiddish book about teenage angst - the author' writ style i sofisticat and so descriptive that it draw you into the picture and you feel a if you're really there (you can taste the sea spray)!

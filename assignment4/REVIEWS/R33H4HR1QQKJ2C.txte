Thi i  in my opinion, a great and much-need book on wxWidget   To date it i the only one.  The preface say  and I agree, that it i \\"accessible to developer with a variety of experience and backgrounds\\".  That said, there will be a steep learn curve for people with limit relevant experience (particularly of C++).  Such reader will require further support, from people, ideally both in person and from Internet resource such a comp.soft-sy wxwindow  <br /> <br />For experienc programmer  even those with experience of wxWidget  the book will be very useful to learn aspect that they have not yet explor  <br /> <br />The book i also invaluable a a reference text, for it link to relat project and software, and the resource on the CD. <br />   <br />

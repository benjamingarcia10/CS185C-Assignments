Well to start with, I should not review thi book simply cause I have not read thi book. For those consider buy thi book, I will be a honest a they come. I have a few alia book both from version 6 & 7 & iv read review from those who bought such book  Some good, some not so good. Let me start out to say, those who write book have someth to share, they take the time, interest to share there year of skill. Those who read book complain, there exspectation are way to high so high they become disapoint  Take a look at the content of thi book then ask yourself if thi i where you are in Maya.In any stage of life we must be ready to explore it wonder  Thi book start off where the foundation closse  Here you will learn advance stage & ye if your not ready to journey such gravel then step back & choose a more simply path so you may come back to thi road when you you are ready. Learn about Parameterization for example i a must for build any model, these patche must match for seemles render so ye  learn such advance skill i a must. Know how to work with tessellation i also a plu for any successful model & I think thi book cover such. Maya must convert to pologonal when render  thi i where tessellation come into to play so ye  learn such i a must. Would I buy thi book ? Sure I would if I need to learn such skill  & if I wa ready. Those that complain that thi book i to hard to follow i just not ready. My advice i to use what you learn in the foundation book & then when the time i right, when you feel it time to take maya to the next level, feel free to explore thi book. Model like anyth  it a skill, you may have the blue print to build the house, you may have the hammer & nail but without skill, a plan i just a plan. Good luck.

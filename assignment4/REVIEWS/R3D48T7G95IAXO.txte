Ye   A bisexual-them novel that isn't dry or academic!  When I heard about thi book on the radio I wa so anxiou to get it because it sound like it would offer a story that wasn't just \\"boy meet girl and they live happily ever after\\" while at the same time be funny.  And it didn't disappoint.  The novel wa an insightful look into how people of differ sexual orientation can get together and somehow succe in fulfill everyone' need   But buy thi book for the humor and the laugh   It may not stand up to any in depth clinical analysi of bisexualism or lesbianism but trust me, that' not the point of the book so don't buy it if that' what you're look for.  However, that be said there are alot of really good point made about society and human nature.  In fact, you'll probably be quot thing Max say   Hi wit and attitude make the story. <br /> <br />I'm hop thi i a sign of thing to come in the whole romantic comedy genre.  If you spend a weekend read thi book you'll feel better about go back to work on Monday because you'll have laugh so much and enjoy a really fresh story.

I thought thi book wa   waste     read time.  I saw   review on the Today Show,   read several postive review   well,     piqu   interest.  What I thought       book     to deal     accept the com changes/challenge     mother/pre-teen daughter relationship wa   book     mother seem to tiptoe around her daughter' emotional state.  What   Sarah go to think   thi  what   she go to say   that, etc.?  The only reason I gave   2 star instead   1   that I applaud the time spent Karen   Sarah spent together.  Someth that should   done   all parent-child relationship    <br /> <br />I   like to think there   better book on thi subject.

I thought thi book wa a waste of my read time.  I saw a review on the Today Show, and read several postive review a well, and it piqu my interest.  What I thought may be a book about how to deal with and accept the com changes/challenge of a mother/pre-teen daughter relationship wa a book about a mother seem to tiptoe around her daughter' emotional state.  What i Sarah go to think about thi  what i she go to say about that, etc.?  The only reason I gave it 2 star instead of 1 i that I applaud the time spent Karen and Sarah spent together.  Someth that should be done in all parent-child relationship    <br /> <br />I would like to think there are better book on thi subject.

I am a huge fan of Derek Jeter'  That' why I chose thi book. I gave it five star because Matt Christopher describ every part of Derek' life accurately. I had already read Derek' autobiography and in that book I learn that hi Dad made him sign contract  In these contract with hi father, Derek had to promise to get good grade -- or else he didn't get to play in any All Star game or anyth  Later, dude!

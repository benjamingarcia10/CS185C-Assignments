Like many people I read thi book shortly after Timothy' fatal maul   I wa expect   academic book   bear that laid out the research finding   Timothy Treadwell.  What I got wa someth     cros between the horse-whisperer   that crazy woman   u to live down the street     tea partie   her 50 stupidly nam cat  <br /> <br />I   to admit I found the book intrigu   I wa constantly feel uneasy   what he wa say       I think spread information   love   animal  especially animal that       risk,   good.  In the end we truly   only save what we value.  But,   the end   thi book I wa deeply concern   what kind     example Timothy   giv the world.  Bear  especially the coastal Brown   Katmai,     blood thirsty killer    the nature   bear   unpredictable,   much like people, different   individual to individual.  Timothy doe make thi clear   hi different encounter   bear    <br /> <br />What Timothy doe   point out or even seem to consider   that historically   time bear   habituat to people, bear suffer.  Timothy' close approach to bear   noth to help the bear or bear research.  At best   only boost hi celebrity.  In the book, he mention several   these irresponsible encounter    one example he lean over to kis   yearl bear on the nose. <br /> <br />I recommend read the book, even     time   seem like watch   train wreck. If possible, read     Grizzly Maze   Nick Jan or Death   the Grizzly Maze   Mike Lapinski.  After   realize that he embellish nearly all part   hi life; claim to   Australian, claim to     orphan .... You   get the grain   salt   should take   thi book.

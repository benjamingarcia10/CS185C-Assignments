Like many people I read thi book shortly after Timothy' fatal maul   I wa expect an academic book about bear that laid out the research finding of Timothy Treadwell.  What I got wa someth of a cros between the horse-whisperer and that crazy woman who u to live down the street who had tea partie with her 50 stupidly nam cat  <br /> <br />I have to admit I found the book intrigu although I wa constantly feel uneasy about what he wa say and do   I think spread information and love for animal  especially animal that could be at risk, i good.  In the end we truly will only save what we value.  But, by the end of thi book I wa deeply concern about what kind of an example Timothy i giv the world.  Bear  especially the coastal Brown in Katmai, are not blood thirsty killer  but the nature of bear i unpredictable, and much like people, different from individual to individual.  Timothy doe make thi clear in hi different encounter with bear    <br /> <br />What Timothy doe not point out or even seem to consider i that historically any time bear become habituat to people, bear suffer.  Timothy' close approach to bear did noth to help the bear or bear research.  At best it only boost hi celebrity.  In the book, he mention several of these irresponsible encounter  in one example he lean over to kis a yearl bear on the nose. <br /> <br />I recommend read the book, even if at time it seem like watch a train wreck. If possible, read it with Grizzly Maze by Nick Jan or Death in the Grizzly Maze by Mike Lapinski.  After you realize that he embellish nearly all part of hi life; claim to be Australian, claim to be an orphan .... You will get the grain of salt you should take with thi book.

Div into maya 6 unexperienc  without an aid i terribly confu  but div into maya 6 with thi book i not that much better -- it i like a nonswimmer be thrown into the deep end of the pool with a deflat lifesaver.  <br /> <br />Sure, the direction are pretty easy to follow, but the problem arise when there are MISSING direction  I wa hav a headache try to get someth to work like it supposedly did in the book, when I realiz that the author FORGOT to include a vital step! I would not have been able to get ahead if I had not figur out the problem on my own (through trial and error). Shame Shame SHAME on the author! Sorry we beginn user are not a professional and proficient in the program.  <br /> <br />I give thi book a C+ at best. Well-written simple direction mean absolutely noth if they are not complete!

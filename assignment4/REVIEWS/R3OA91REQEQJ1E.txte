Thi book i almost identical to the Spr developer' guide available on the web site.  They follow the same chapter and format, and provide little new information, maybe some code.  But once you start to get into Spr and use it, you'll want a reference that i more in depth.  With thi book, you'll find yourself struggl to find the detail by brow google and javadoc all day.  Pro Spr i a better book that give you more insight into how Spr work   My background i provid a service interface layer for a J2EE portal.  I'm not develop the MVC so I didn't pay attention to those part of the book.

My father brought home a copy of thi unique book from a tag sale one day in the 60' and it immediately became my favorite book before High School.  Thi work consist of hundred of simple but accurate line drawing of every imaginable fly machine (or, in the early year  would-be fly machines) which I would copy and trace for hour  even after even   I suspect the last edition I know of from 1978 probably just add more drawing without sacrific the format, but it' really the drawing from Da Vinci through the 30' that are the soul of the collection, so it doesn't matter much which edition you end up with.   <br /> <br />I know of no other catalog of so many of the glider and pusher in under one cover.  If you're a fan of early flight, you can't do without a copy of any edition of thi book.

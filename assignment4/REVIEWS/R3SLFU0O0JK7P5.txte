wxWidget i an application framework for developer who want to develop very good-look application for Linux, Window or Mac. The fact that your application can be re-compil for any of the three operat system i definetly an attractive plu  My development i mainly for Linux, and when I first ran accros wxWidget  I wa amaz at how quickly I could get a simple application go in under an hour. Compil the library i a easy a issu a few command from a terminal window, chang to the sample directory, and runn make under the minimal sample directory. <br /> <br />Bear in mind that develop application i not for complete beginner  You should know C/C++ already, and be reasonably familiar with your OS and compiler. That way, follow the example given in the book, and read the source code from wxWidget sample directory, can get you up and runn in a minimum of time. I came from a C background, but I had a reasonably complicat inter-airport messag system for a local goverment authority work in two week  with the help of a serial communication library contribut by another wxWidget user. <br /> <br />The book come with a CD full of useful tool and community contribution  I have yet to see, in my 30+ year of programm and project management, a framework a complete a wxWidget  The support from other user i extraordinary, and you can often be talk to the original developer who are more than will to help you get go  The fact that it i open source ensure thi fantastic library will alway be improv  <br /> <br />Thi book i someth I wa await for a long time. It i definetly worth the price (and then some).

I read thi book 1st to myself, then to   mother over the phone long distance,   finally to   son   ha Asperger   Thi book fit   son to   tee.  I   shar thi book   so many people. Everyone   ha read   say the same th   It help explain what life   like   people   Asperger       very easy to read way \\"  good resource book\\".  Today I   tak   to hi doctor on our reg. visit today.  For someone     got   diag.   need help explain   to other thi   the book    .  I   read many book on Asperger   none   such   easy to read format that even kid   understand.  My church want to get   copy   the library there.  I think thi book should   read     work   Asperger children or really   children   general.  With Asperger kid they look like   other kid   sometime people don't understand there   someth   go on   them because they look normal.  I wish I   thi book earlier so I     given   to   city to read   I     meet   them regard discrimation     child   Asperger

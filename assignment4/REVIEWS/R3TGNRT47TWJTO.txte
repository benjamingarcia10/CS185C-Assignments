I read thi book 1st to myself, then to my mother over the phone long distance, and finally to my son who ha Asperger   Thi book fit my son to a tee.  I have shar thi book with so many people. Everyone who ha read it say the same th   It help explain what life i like for people with Asperger but in a very easy to read way \\"a good resource book\\".  Today I am tak it to hi doctor on our reg. visit today.  For someone who just got a diag. and need help explain it to other thi i the book for you.  I have read many book on Asperger but none in such a easy to read format that even kid can understand.  My church want to get a copy for the library there.  I think thi book should be read by whoever work with Asperger children or really just children in general.  With Asperger kid they look like any other kid and sometime people don't understand there i someth else go on with them because they look normal.  I wish I had thi book earlier so I could had given it to my city to read when I had a meet with them regard discrimation of my child with Asperger

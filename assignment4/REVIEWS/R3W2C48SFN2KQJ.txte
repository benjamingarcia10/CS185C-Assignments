The surpri aspect of the book i that it i the only book devot to wxWidget  though the latter ha been around since 92. One might have expect other text by now. Perhap thi suggest that wxWidget i not that heavily u  Or maybe since it wa all open source, it lack an adverti budget. So unlike Java or C#/.NET, there wa no corporate sponsor to underwrite book on it.<br /><br />Anyhow, thi text show wxWidget to be a complete graphic system. Portable acros all major current operat system  All the [remaining] unixe and linux. Plu Microsoft' operat system  And don't forget the Mac or the PalmOS.<br /><br />A reader might immediately ask, why not just use Java, instead of C++ and wxWidget  Well, it come back to the efficiency issue. Java excel on the server side of web application  But the author explain that there i still a performance penalty compar to C++, which compile down to native binarie  They also point out that the graphic approach in wxWidget i to use the native widget whenever possible. Thi produce UI that the user in those operat system will be familiar with. Wherea Java tend to go with non-native widget <br /><br />The length of the book reflect the reality that any comprehensive graphic system these day ha to cover a lot of ground. Drag and drop, internationalisation, multithread  dialog and much more.<br /><br />In programm complexity, it seem simpler than the XWindow toolkit, which wa wretchedly awful to learn.

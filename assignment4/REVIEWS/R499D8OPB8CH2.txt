I really lik thi book. I   been pack   to     work to home     everyday because I'm work on   project   home   well. It make   excellent reference   I wish some section were   little longer, like the sizer section. Thi book isn't   someone brand new to C++       great   someone   know the basic   C++ like pointer  inheritance, classe   the like. You don't ne to know   to use template    callback    slot mechanism  or the STL.  I   suggest pay strong attention to the Hello World sample   acquaint yourself   the event table macro system   the basic wxwidget control like button, checkboxe  text boxe    the wxstr clas  I   been work     little     wxwidget  trudg through the online help     some help   GUI builder like wx-dev-cpp (free)   dialogblock (  the author     very reasonable price). The book help   lot   the index   TOC   well arrang  The CD contain   lot   extra software,   I   skip try to learn command line compiler   use   GUI IDE to start  ,   wx-dev-cpp (  look on google) pull all thi together     so   don't   to try   figure out ANYTHING other than wxwidget  I like tak thing   babystep instead   div into the maelstrom   sett up   complete environment. Overall thi book   serve   well       enter the world wxWidget  despite   wart or two here or there.

I really lik thi book. I have been pack it to and from work to home just about everyday because I'm work on a project at home a well. It make an excellent reference although I wish some section were a little longer, like the sizer section. Thi book isn't for someone brand new to C++ but it i great for someone who know the basic of C++ like pointer  inheritance, classe and the like. You don't ne to know how to use template  do callback  do slot mechanism  or the STL.  I do suggest pay strong attention to the Hello World sample and acquaint yourself with the event table macro system and the basic wxwidget control like button, checkboxe  text boxe  and the wxstr clas  I have been work for a little while with wxwidget  trudg through the online help and with some help from GUI builder like wx-dev-cpp (free) and dialogblock (from the author at a very reasonable price). The book help a lot and the index and TOC are well arrang  The CD contain a lot of extra software, but I would skip try to learn command line compiler and use a GUI IDE to start with, and wx-dev-cpp (just look on google) pull all thi together for you so you don't have to try and figure out ANYTHING other than wxwidget  I like tak thing in babystep instead of div into the maelstrom of sett up a complete environment. Overall thi book will serve you well if you are enter the world wxWidget  despite a wart or two here or there.

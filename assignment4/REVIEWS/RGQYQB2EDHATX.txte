Thi i a delightful book for children about child saint  In the open paragraph it explain that a \\"Golden Legend\\" wa \\"an enormou book which a learn priest had set down everyth he could find about the saint and martyr of the Church, everyth he thought interest  amu sometime  and of course instructive.\\" Thi i such a book. While I wouldn't say that by \\"instructive\\" that there wa any preach that really went on here. The one historical inaccuracy that I found in thi Golden Legend wa where it talk about Saul go to Damascu by foot and alone, rather than by horse and with other  a i depict in the book of Act  However the rest of the story gave you greater insight a to what that must have been like for him.<br /><br />It i one of those book you hate to see come to an end. And I am sad that it i out of print. I got mine from my library, though I wish that I could have a copy to give to my nephew.

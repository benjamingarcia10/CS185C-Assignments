I lov the book on Liv with Wild Bear !! But a I pick up the book that follow it I wa disappoint  Death in the Grizzly Maze.  <br /> I personally enjoy Timothy' book. I got to see what it wa like to live with bear through one person eye   <br />I would not reccomend read Death in the Grizzley Maze. It wa disheartn

First   all,   thi       minor point,   ba on the cover photo   title   thi book, I thought         the author' experience   part   the Zoo TV tour.  A   turn out, M  Cashman work   U2 dur the Joshua Tree tour 4 or 5 year previou   I find the cover   the book mislead   that sense.<br /><br />The author doe   credibility problem  due to the fact that U2 recently su her   the return   item they say she stole   them dur her employment.  The judge found that M  Cashman' account     she acquir the item wa highly unlikely,   sid   the band.  It'   well establish that her departure   U2' employment wa   amicable.  For that reason she       grudge to bear   her former employer   You   to take all   that into account   read thi book.<br /><br />So should   read  ?  Well, there   some interest tidbit here.  You learn   the U2 image wa develop    the meticulou plann that went into every detail   their wardrobe     they present themselve to the public.  On the other hand, some anecdote seem to   no purpose other than to embarras the band member   Her continual rant against U2' management seem self serv   unnecessary.  And   all due respect, I didn't buy the book to read Lola Cashman' life story.<br /><br />If     find thi     local library or u bookstore,       worth   time.  I wouldn't recommend spend $20-30 on  .

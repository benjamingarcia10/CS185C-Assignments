First of all, and thi may be a minor point, but ba on the cover photo and title of thi book, I thought it would be about the author' experience a part of the Zoo TV tour.  A it turn out, M  Cashman work for U2 dur the Joshua Tree tour 4 or 5 year previou   I find the cover of the book mislead in that sense.<br /><br />The author doe have credibility problem  due to the fact that U2 recently su her for the return of item they say she stole from them dur her employment.  The judge found that M  Cashman' account of how she acquir the item wa highly unlikely, and sid with the band.  It' also well establish that her departure from U2' employment wa not amicable.  For that reason she may have a grudge to bear with her former employer   You have to take all of that into account in read thi book.<br /><br />So should you read it?  Well, there are some interest tidbit here.  You learn how the U2 image wa develop  and the meticulou plann that went into every detail of their wardrobe and how they present themselve to the public.  On the other hand, some anecdote seem to have no purpose other than to embarras the band member   Her continual rant against U2' management seem self serv and unnecessary.  And with all due respect, I didn't buy the book to read Lola Cashman' life story.<br /><br />If you can find thi in your local library or u bookstore, it might be worth your time.  I wouldn't recommend spend $20-30 on it.

Catch-22 i a great book in my point of view. It isn't just a war book; it goe a lot deeper than that. It ha a variety of theme and moral  it just matter how you choose to look at it. Yossarian, the main character, i serv with the Air Force near the Mediterranean. A the time progresse  he understand that war i go on and there are enemie out there who want to kill him. Hi main goal i to stay alive. <br />    <br />     The book show how Yossarian take the war personally and tell it to u from hi view. The novel contain passion with which later come hate. For those of you who are into history, the book will tell you the situation in Rome through Yossarian' eye  In the book, Yossarian i a rebel who i go against the society' belief  He manage to avoid death by know what a preciou th life i  By the end of the book he succeed in regain the control of hi life.  <br /> <br />     If you have read or plann to read thi book, I suggest to also pick up a novel \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Thi book i stag in the future, but the main character undergoe some of the same dilemma a Yossarian.

I know very little   the financial industry or investment bank  so   I first pick up thi book, I wa   bit skeptical that I   understand or enjoy the plot. My fear were completely unfound -   fact, I found thi book difficult to put down! The author draw     immediately   colorful character set against   intrigu backdrop   salaciou undercurrent. The protagonist, Martin Stallworth,     endear character that    't help root  . And the storyline move     very fast pace that keep   engag until the very end. I absolutely lov  ! Thi book   make   great movie.

I know very little about the financial industry or investment bank  so when I first pick up thi book, I wa a bit skeptical that I would understand or enjoy the plot. My fear were completely unfound - in fact, I found thi book difficult to put down! The author draw you in immediately with colorful character set against an intrigu backdrop and salaciou undercurrent. The protagonist, Martin Stallworth, i an endear character that you can't help root for. And the storyline move at a very fast pace that keep you engag until the very end. I absolutely lov it! Thi book would make a great movie.

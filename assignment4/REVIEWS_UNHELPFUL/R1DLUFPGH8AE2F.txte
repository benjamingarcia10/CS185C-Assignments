I said Deja'vu cause it like live in the book. <br />I'm not a dancer but I lov the way the foamate wa laid out how they travel around to new club .I lik that in her feild of dance she made money ,and that it wa people who car about her .I lik that she wa confordent in herself even though she went threw a lot .I lik most of all Jannett. she remind me of myself funny,lov ,and witty. I think Destiny i a very goof book and need to be read by many reader .It ha a lot to offer for a young girl that tak a chance in the world on her on .

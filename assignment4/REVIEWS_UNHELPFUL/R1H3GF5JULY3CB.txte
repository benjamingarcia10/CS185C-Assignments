I read thi one after read Plantation. The two book I have read so far by thi author; Plantation and Unforgettable were both very good. I am surpri to find that thi author i so unknow. No one I know ha ever heard of her, and most of her book are out of print. I had to borrow both book from the library.  <br /> <br />So anyway, if you can find a copy, I would recommend read them, a I said they were very good.

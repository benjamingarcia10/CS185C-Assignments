Raymond Feist wa not the first author I read a book from when first com into fantasy, but I wish it had been, he i by far the best in hi clas next to Tolkien. In the First book magician Pug And Thoma  I gat shiver think about it i have never enjoy another book better then Feist' book' in my 20 year liv I would say if you hadn't read thi book you mis out on an experience. The transformation that Pug and Thoma go throw both be so unique and so original in think that i wa blown away.; Arutha by far i the greatest charater in both a book world and someone you might meet on the street. Every character Feist introduce It' hard to explain it' almost like there real just com out of the page and talk to you face to face he really make it good and thr depth that the story goe into i almost feel like it could happen. The there that deep family feel that come at you when you read about Duke Borric and Arutha and Lyme and of course Martin WOW!!!!!! That someth only a Master of word can accomplish.

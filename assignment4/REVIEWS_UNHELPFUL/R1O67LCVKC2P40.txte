Stingmaster i a great book that strengthen your imagination and to do a degree , make u all in a way relate. Personally, I had the pleasure to have Mr.Settle a a teacher and he' taught me many thing that some people wouldn't learn in a life time. To declare thi book, \\"It' Sucks\\" i an insult to the character of the author a well a the person.

<br />      I did like the book. It wa full of excitement and horror. It wa also very interest how he would just think of someth and then go and do it.  <br />     Brian Robeson wa thirteen and on hi way to see hi father. The pilot ha a heart attack and the plane eventually crashe into an L shap lake. Brian survive somehow but i a little brui  He learn how to survive in the wild and how to make fire. After a while there i a tornado. The tornado wa so strong it lift the tail of the plane right out of the water. When Brian see it he remember the survival pack. He build a raft and float out to the plane. He use hi hatchet to cut a hole large enough for him to get in. he find the pack jamm under one of the seat  When he finally get it loose he look up and see the body of the pilot. There wa no skin left on hi face because the fish had been eat it, the fishe he had been eat  Will he find a transmitter?  <br />     The type of person who would like thi book i someone who like to read about adventurou and somewhat gros book  In the book he see and doe some disgust thing but it i still a really good book to read. <br />

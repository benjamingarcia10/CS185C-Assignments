So what big th happen   1776?  The Declaration   Independence wa sign  result   the birth   the Unit State   Thi incident, historically the most significant event   the year,   hardly even referr to   David McCullough' book, 1776.  Instead, hi history focuse on the battle   the Revolutionary War that took place   that pivotal year. <br /> <br />The Revolution start   1775,     wa   1776 that the battl start to   more significant, the result     heighten British resolve to contain the rebellion     colonie   Outnumber   generally better train British soldier   Hessian mercenarie  much   the year wa   serie   unpleasant defeat temper   minor victorie   A the year came to   close, the Revolution wa on the brink   failure,   then Washington l hi troop into   pair   big win  first   Trenton, then Princeton. <br /> <br />In term   sheer number  these     seem like small victorie    they re-energiz the Revolutionary force       turn point   the war.  Unlike the D-Day invasion nearly two centurie later, thi turn point wouldn't lead to victory   les than   year;   fact, the key win   Yorktown wouldn't occur   another five year   peace     two year beyond even that. <br /> <br />Writ     particular year       easy way to approach history.  When writ   biography (such   Truman or John Adams), there     distinct beginn   end   birth   death.  Similarly,   McCullough wrote   the build   the Panama Canal or Brooklyn Bridge, he   natural start point   A year, however,   rather arbitrary,   human event rarely fit so neatly into   calendar.  I think thi make McCullough' book suffer   little   he need to force hi story to fit hi topic (  inde  the book   deal   lot   1775   well).  To  , thi make thi one   hi weaker effort      merely good after   str   great book   noth to scoff  .  Aim   the general reader, thi     worthwhile look   the early struggle   the Revolution     close   came to end quite differently. <br />

So what big th happen in 1776?  The Declaration of Independence wa sign  result in the birth of the Unit State   Thi incident, historically the most significant event of the year, i hardly even referr to in David McCullough' book, 1776.  Instead, hi history focuse on the battle of the Revolutionary War that took place in that pivotal year. <br /> <br />The Revolution start in 1775, but it wa in 1776 that the battl start to become more significant, the result of a heighten British resolve to contain the rebellion in it colonie   Outnumber by generally better train British soldier and Hessian mercenarie  much of the year wa a serie of unpleasant defeat temper by minor victorie   A the year came to a close, the Revolution wa on the brink of failure, but then Washington l hi troop into a pair of big win  first at Trenton, then Princeton. <br /> <br />In term of sheer number  these may have seem like small victorie  but they re-energiz the Revolutionary force and became a turn point in the war.  Unlike the D-Day invasion nearly two centurie later, thi turn point wouldn't lead to victory in les than a year; in fact, the key win at Yorktown wouldn't occur for another five year and peace would be two year beyond even that. <br /> <br />Writ about a particular year i not an easy way to approach history.  When writ a biography (such a Truman or John Adams), there i a distinct beginn and end with birth and death.  Similarly, when McCullough wrote of the build of the Panama Canal or Brooklyn Bridge, he had natural start point   A year, however, i rather arbitrary, a human event rarely fit so neatly into a calendar.  I think thi make McCullough' book suffer a little a he need to force hi story to fit hi topic (and inde  the book actually deal a lot with 1775 a well).  To me, thi make thi one of hi weaker effort  but be merely good after a str of great book i noth to scoff at.  Aim at the general reader, thi i a worthwhile look at the early struggle of the Revolution and how close it came to end quite differently. <br />

I lov thi book and found it extremely gripp if not a bit (okay, more than a bit) far-fetch  That said, I read thi book alone and totally freak myself out every night because it wa really scary. There are some section of the book that will blow your mind. I wa not bor a bit, but I found myself think that nobody would do the thing that Billy, the main character, did. I haven't read a Dean Koontz book in year because he start gett too weird. I only like to read book about people and thing that could really happen. I highly recommend thi book and look forward to hi next book.

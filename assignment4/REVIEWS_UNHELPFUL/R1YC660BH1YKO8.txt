Blue wa   lot   fun to read.  After gett confu   the first 40 or so page  try to keep up   Padgett' tangent   non sequitar  finally the plot began.  Then   got rivet   fun.  And the humor   great.  I laugh out loud many time  <br />It     woman-center  pro-women book   that   fine.  Can't wait to read the next book   the serie   hope that Padgett keep on add more book to  .  Don't want to write more or  'll give away the conclusion   thi     book many women   want to read.  And   make good point   well       good read.

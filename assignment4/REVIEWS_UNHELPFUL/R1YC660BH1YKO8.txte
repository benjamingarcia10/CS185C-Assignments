Blue wa a lot of fun to read.  After gett confu in the first 40 or so page  try to keep up with Padgett' tangent and non sequitar  finally the plot began.  Then it got rivet and fun.  And the humor i great.  I laugh out loud many time  <br />It i a woman-center  pro-women book and that i fine.  Can't wait to read the next book in the serie and hope that Padgett keep on add more book to it.  Don't want to write more or it'll give away the conclusion but thi i a book many women will want to read.  And it make good point a well a be a good read.

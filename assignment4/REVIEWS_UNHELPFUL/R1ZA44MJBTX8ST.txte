Stanley Hasting i anyth but the typical hard-boil or brilliantly deductive detective. Throughout the book he compare what he doe to what a 'real' private detective would have done. <br />Yet it' hi reflective nature that help him inadvertantly stumble onto the solution to crime  And for me, that' the charm of thi serie  <br /> <br />     Hav read negative review of the first Hasting novel, Detective, I decid to start here and I'm glad I did.

I read thi book when I wa just beginn to turn into one of those hormone wreck teen  Maybe that' why it made such a huge impact on me. I found myself wonder what I would do in the same circumstance and sympathiz with the character  The author doe not say which option i right or wrong, she doesn't preach, but merely make the reader understand that no matter what the character chose - mistake or not - it wa a very difficult and important choice. She doe not make the mistake of a happily ever after end either, but acknowledge the many obstacle ahead for all of them. In the end, it i the characters' determination to make it work out that give the book a hopeful end  <br /> <br />It wa my first look into abortion. Afterward  I wa still interest  and for several school paper I chose thi topic to explore. <br /> <br />(Several spoiler beneath) <br /> <br />The storie of Diedre and Treva hit harder than Pepper'  Perhap it' because of the fact that Pepper ha already had an abortion before. I know that if I had one, I would never want to repeat the experience (especially since the author describe the painful process).  <br /> <br />The best and most heart-wrench part of the book i when Mitch - the man who got Diedre pregnant, later goe to an abortion clinic to try and understand why and how it felt for Diedre to get an abortion on her own. It i with thi new understand that he meet Diedre with that make me believe that they might have a second chance. <br /> <br />After all these year  I can still remember the character' name and believe me, that i say someth  I read so many that usually they blur together! (Well, maybe that' my bad memory' fault too...) Anyone could learn from thi book, regardles of race, gender, or age. I would definitely have my daughter read thi book. <br /> <br />

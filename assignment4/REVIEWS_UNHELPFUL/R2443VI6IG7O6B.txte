Pop i a nice story that will br you back to your childhood. Told through the voice of Freddy, you follow the exploit of he and Nate, and Silk doe a nice job of mak the reader really feel for the two of them. I do wish that it did not end so suddenly. Hope we hear more from Silk. He ha a nice touch.

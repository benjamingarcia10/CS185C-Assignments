I thought thi book wa really good. I like the character of Brian. Brian wa able to overcome be in a plane crash and hav problem at home with hi mom and dad. Even though he had problem in hi life he wa able to overcome them and learn how to survive in the wildernes  Surviv in the wildernes probably help him learn how to survive in life.In the wildernes he made food and shelter for himself. He kill animal only for survival.I think everyone would enjoy read thi book includ adult  <br /> <br />Nichola Bohana

I study Polish American History, and I am not Polish!  So I want to learn a little Polish to talk to my fellow Polish scholar and not seem like an oaf.  I usually did each lesson twice before I mov on.  The true test came two month after complet the course, I met two Polish native   To my surprise, I wa able to communicate in a basic sense and not embarras myself! (I did even order a beverage at an establishment that only spoke Polish.) Even funnier, I am also learn Chinese and I find myself occasionally respond in Polish!   Thi wa an outstand start, and worth the money!

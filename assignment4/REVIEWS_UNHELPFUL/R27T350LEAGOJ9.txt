I   known so little   thi area   our country     history,   after read Camptown, I feel like   native.  Kenn Grime ha brought hi character to life   such   realistic way   woven them into storie that I believe.  Perhap some       fiction   some factual,   hi story-tell skill blur the boundarie   I kept ask myself, \\"Did thi REALLY happen?\\"  I highly recommend thi lively picture     world that everyone should live  ,   only     few delightful hour

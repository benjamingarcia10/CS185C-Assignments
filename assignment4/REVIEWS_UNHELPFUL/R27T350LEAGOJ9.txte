I had known so little about thi area of our country and it history, yet after read Camptown, I feel like a native.  Kenn Grime ha brought hi character to life in such a realistic way and woven them into storie that I believe.  Perhap some of it i fiction and some factual, yet hi story-tell skill blur the boundarie   I kept ask myself, \\"Did thi REALLY happen?\\"  I highly recommend thi lively picture of a world that everyone should live in, if only for a few delightful hour

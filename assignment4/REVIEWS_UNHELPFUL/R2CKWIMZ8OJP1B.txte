Thi i a delightful little book that make me wish I had met Kiro Kama, a fun-lov  very wise Japanese Taoist.  Kiro tend hi garden and teache Jim how to tame hi mind and how to live more in the moment.  I have read lot of personal development book  but thi i one I will return to again and again.  It practical life lesson have already repaid the cost of the book. I strongly recommend it.

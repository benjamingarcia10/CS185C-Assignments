Thi book i a romanticiz  sanitiz account of the 1950 French expedition to the Himalaya by it so call leader, Maurice Herzog. It i a book that i reflective of the time in which it wa written. Still, it should be a must read for anyone who i interest in high altitude climb <br /><br />I first read thi book in the early 1960 a a young teenager. I recall be enthrall by it and amaz at the hardship the climber endur to br glory to France. In read it again a an adult, I find myself still enthrall  but more attun to the fact that it i written in a somewhat self-serv style.<br /><br />The book itself chronicle the attempt by the French to climb an 8,000 meter peak in the Himalaya  They had two alternative  Dhaulagiri and Annapurna. In those day  the Himalaya were largely unchart and any topographical map that exist at the time prov to be largely incorrect. So, the French expedition spent a large portion of their time in reconnaissance. Not only were they there to climb the mountain, they had to find a way to get to it and then map out a route on the unknown terrain to the summit. Ultimately, they chose to climb Annapurna.<br /><br />In read thi book, one must remember that the climb took place without the sophisticat equipment or protective cloth available today. Thi wa before gortex and freeze-dri food  Thi climb wa made before Nepal or climb the Himalaya became a major tourist attraction. The condition for traveller were extremely primitive and difficult under the best of circumstance <br /><br />When the expedition finally find a route to Annapurna, the reader almost feel like cheer for them. When they start to climb, one sense that, in comparison to latter day expedition  they are not so well equipp or savvy about the danger one can encounter dur a high altitude climb or the risk in do it without supplemental oxygen, a they did. Then one realize that they were pioneer  They were pav the way for other <br /><br />The climb to the summit by Maurice Herzog and hi partner, Loui Lachenal, i interest  but it i their harrow descent and return to civilization which i rivet  The two summiteer begin their descent but run into difficultie  They are fortunate to encounter two of their fellow climber  Lionel Terray and Gaston Rebuffat, who are contemplat their own summit assault but, instead, choose to aid their comrade in the descent, forego their own quest for the summit.<br /><br />The travail which the climber encounter on the descent would have finish off les hardy soul  Maurice Herzog lose hi glove dur the descent and ha no spare pair. One of them fall into a crevasse which, believe it or not, turn out to be a good th  They are caught in an avalanche. They get lost in a storm. They become frostbitten and two of them, are, ultimately, forc to endure amputation <br /><br />The medical treatment they receiv by the expedition doctor i unbelievable and almost primitive. Employ treatment for frostbite that have since fallen onto disrepute (excruciatingly painful arterial injection  for example), the doctor i almost frighten  at time  The reader cannot help but feel pity for the suffer the injur climber endur  maggot ridden flesh, amputation without anaesthesia, and lack of proper medical care for a protract period of time.<br /><br />The heroic of some of the Sherpa  a on most expedition  go largely unsung. One must, however, pause to reflect on the fact that a thi all took place before airlift were available, the injur climber had to be carri  Their exodu back to the frontier took about five week  Who carri them down the mountain, over the moraine  on makeshift bridge over flood  rag river  through dense jungle? Who else but the Sherpa  What thank did they get? None, a usual.<br /><br />Anyway, when the expedition finally return to France, Maurice Herzog i laud a a national hero by the French. He become the media darl  The other three climber  a are the rest of those on the expedition, are largely ignor and forgotten. Therein lie the tale. If you want to know how thi polarization came about, I highly recommend that you also read 'True Summit' by David Robert  It give you the inside scoop about the expedition and how thing really were.<br /><br />Notwithstand it idealization, romanticism, and everyth i hunky-dory routine, Herzog' book i still a must read for all climb enthusiast urice Herzog i laud a a national hero by the French.

Poppie i a wonderfully written story which take you on a journey through the live of so many enchant character  It wa so hard to put down and I wa so sad to finish it because I felt like I \\"knew\\" the character and want to see what became of them next! Deena Thomson ha a flair for storytell that i extremely rare.

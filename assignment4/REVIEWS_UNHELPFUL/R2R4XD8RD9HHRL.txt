\\"Marchlands\\"   one   the most beautifully written novel I   ever read     long time. It ha thought & language that flow so naturally,   though Sophie, herself were there    .  <br /> <br />Thi story wa written very astoundingly accurate to the going on   every day life. A near carbon-copy   what       believe were actual event  <br /> <br />However, thi story wa written     style unlike the traditional quotation u to capture what   individual   say & so I found     little hard to follow & often   to re-read paragraph   to time to time to sort out   wa say what.  <br /> <br />I   found that due to the realism & some   the subject matter, mainly the sexual content & animal exploitation that take place, I feel that thi novel   mistakenly catigoriz   teen fiction   honestly,   appear to fall more so under adult.

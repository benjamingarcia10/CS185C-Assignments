\\"Marchlands\\" i one of the most beautifully written novel I have ever read in a long time. It ha thought & language that flow so naturally, a though Sophie, herself were there with you.  <br /> <br />Thi story wa written very astoundingly accurate to the going on of every day life. A near carbon-copy of what you could almost believe were actual event  <br /> <br />However, thi story wa written in a style unlike the traditional quotation u to capture what each individual i say & so I found it a little hard to follow & often had to re-read paragraph from to time to time to sort out who wa say what.  <br /> <br />I also found that due to the realism & some of the subject matter, mainly the sexual content & animal exploitation that take place, I feel that thi novel i mistakenly catigoriz a teen fiction when honestly, it appear to fall more so under adult.

McCullough probably know 18th century America   well   anyone alive today,       focu on one year   that century, even what   arguably   most dynamic   important year, he misse the scope that wa there to make John Adam the great book   wa <br /><br />1776     hollow feel to  . It seem hurri   shallow       been slightly longer I think       benefitt   greater exploration   the daily life   these time  Thi book   still worth read       another feather     author' cap. In other hand thi   probably     book I'd speak     more praise   les nitpick    know   I   what McCullough   capable     top form, I recogniz that thi book wa slightly sub-par     historian   writer   hi talent <br /><br />I  , however, look forward to hi next book,   I'll   sure to pre-order,   I   1776.

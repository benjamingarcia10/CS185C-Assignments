McCullough probably know 18th century America a well a anyone alive today, and yet in focu on one year of that century, even what i arguably it most dynamic and important year, he misse the scope that wa there to make John Adam the great book it wa <br /><br />1776 had a hollow feel to it. It seem hurri and shallow and had it been slightly longer I think it would have benefitt from greater exploration of the daily life in these time  Thi book i still worth read and i yet another feather in it author' cap. In other hand thi would probably be a book I'd speak of with more praise and les nitpick  but know a I do what McCullough i capable of in top form, I recogniz that thi book wa slightly sub-par for an historian and writer of hi talent <br /><br />I do, however, look forward to hi next book, which I'll be sure to pre-order, a I did 1776.

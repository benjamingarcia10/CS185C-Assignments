Wow! Thi i not the typical chick lit fare! I could not put thi one down and end up read and finish it late in the night. Thi novel ha a depth and sensitivity toward the character that wa totally unexpect  I wa think thi would be a nice light R Dres Ink read, but it totally surpri me! I really car for and ach with the character  I felt their struggle  their vulnerabilitie  Previously I had enjoy Rech' first novel, Lo It much more than average chick lit, but thi book surpas even her first one. I will certainly pick up any of Rech' future book  Thank for provid chick lit that ha real substance and heart!!

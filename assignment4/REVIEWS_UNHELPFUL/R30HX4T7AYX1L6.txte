Vladimir Nabokov i so often call a \\"master stylist\\" that it i easy to forget that he i an adept storyteller a well. Even though PNIN, one of hi lesser known work  threaten to disappear under the gorgeou stylistic turn  it i ultimately the pathetic title character and hi nemesis/narrator who drive thi novel. Pnin i a Russian instructor at a college, and, due to hi solitary existence and hi failure to grasp the subtletie of English, he ha become a runn joke to most of hi colleague  He i fussy, awkward, and usually clueles  The novel read a episode in Pnin' life: lo hi lecture note on a train he should never have been on; hi weekend with other Russian immigrant  the crush love and hope he experience when hi ex-wife visit him; a party he give for hi colleague  The narrator' the bit and hilariou commentary about Pnin and those he associate with keep the reader from tak these event too seriously. But should we?<br /><br />In the writ of thi work, Nabokov break all the rule  Hi shift in points-of-view, hi sometime favor of lengthy exposition over scene, hi dropp of plot and subplot just a they get go all work precisely because he i such a skill novelist and know the effect of abandon convention  In dash the reader' hope  hi style take tenaciou hold of the reader' imagination; we learn to trust the voice - even if we shouldn't. Thi last i what i truly brilliant about the novel: we allow ourselve to be swept into a story of non-event and patho  laugh along the way and becom in essence yet another of Pnin' mock colleague <br /><br />Student of literature and book discussion group can discover a wealth of topic here: I the narrator reliable? How can the narrator be both omniscient and a specific character? How doe the touch story of Pnin' first love fit with the mock tone in the rest of the novel? What i the range of the Russian immigrant experience Nabokov supplie  I Pnin heroic or merely pathetic?<br /><br />While PNIN i hardly the masterpiece that PALE FIRE or LOLITA i  it ha it own reward  Once I advanc past the first chapter, I didn't want to leave thi odd, Old World character. Highly recommend  especially if you've already read one or more of Nabokov' other work ce Nabokov supplie  I Pnin heroic or merely pathetic? <br /> <br />While PNIN i hardly the masterpiece that PALE FIRE or LOLITA i  it ha it own reward  Once I advanc past the first chapter, I didn't want to leave thi odd, Old World character.

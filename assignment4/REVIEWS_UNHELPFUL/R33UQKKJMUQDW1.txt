I've never thought Clive Barker should   categoriz     horror writer - he' much more.  My favorite book   Barker   been the one that   fantasy:  Weaveworld, Imajica, The Thief   Alway   In the case   Abarat,  ' fantasy book through   through,   there   trace   hi horror root show through.   In classic Barker style, he demonstrate   amaz imagination.  Abarat     the adventure     young girl nam Candy   leave our world   end up   Abarat,   strange world   she goe   one adventure to the next.  She   cha     villian nam Carrion,   ha nightmare swimm     tank around hi head.  He   unleash the nightmare - they look like eel - to fe on other people.  The world Barker ha imagin     place   time     location   doesn't change - Abarat   fill   island that   represent   different hour   the day. <br /> <br />Abarat     book written   young adult      lot   older people   enjoy  .  One comment   don't expect Harry Potter.  I read   Harry Potter book     the same time   Abarat,   wa   mistake because I kept compar the two book   Wherea Harry Potter   many way   adult book   term     darknes   theme  Abarat really   meant   young adult   It'   lighter story.  Thi     to demean  , only to say know what to expect.  Clive Barker doe   wonderful job   hi character  plot,   description   I   highly recommend     people   know   love Barker' fantasy book

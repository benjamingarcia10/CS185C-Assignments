I've never thought Clive Barker should be categoriz a a horror writer - he' much more.  My favorite book by Barker have been the one that are fantasy:  Weaveworld, Imajica, The Thief of Alway   In the case of Abarat, it' fantasy book through and through, but there are trace of hi horror root show through.   In classic Barker style, he demonstrate an amaz imagination.  Abarat i about the adventure of a young girl nam Candy who leave our world and end up in Abarat, a strange world where she goe from one adventure to the next.  She i cha by a villian nam Carrion, who ha nightmare swimm in a tank around hi head.  He can unleash the nightmare - they look like eel - to fe on other people.  The world Barker ha imagin i a place where time i a location and doesn't change - Abarat i fill with island that each represent a different hour of the day. <br /> <br />Abarat i a book written for young adult  although a lot of older people will enjoy it.  One comment i don't expect Harry Potter.  I read a Harry Potter book at about the same time a Abarat, which wa a mistake because I kept compar the two book   Wherea Harry Potter i many way an adult book in term of it darknes and theme  Abarat really i meant for young adult   It' a lighter story.  Thi i not to demean it, only to say know what to expect.  Clive Barker doe a wonderful job with hi character  plot, and description   I would highly recommend it for people who know and love Barker' fantasy book

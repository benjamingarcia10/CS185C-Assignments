If you're like me, and can predict the unfold of a potboiler on page five, you're go to love thi book. You will figure out about 85% of it. The 15% you didn't see com will knock you off your feet. More to the point, it will have you absolutely GLUED to the page until the last desperate plot twist unfold  Even if you think you know how it' all go to end (you won't), the character will hold you fast: Charle  the inept ad man and stray husband who suffer far more than anyone should for a one-night stand, hi bewilder and rock-solid wife who doesn't know how dangerou a game her husband i play  and their teen-ag daughter who i struggl to live with a disease that leave her dependent on the parent she i rebell against. Charles' descent into hell and hi attempt to crawl out of the pit are narrat in fast-pac  antiseptic prose with all the punch of a fighter go for the knockout. Invest in thi book and you will not regret it.

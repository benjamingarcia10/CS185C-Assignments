Thi story start out well. The protagonist   one   the FBI' top <br />profiler   the support character     detective inspector   <br />Scotland Yard. Essentially, the two   try to track down   modern <br />day Jack the Ripper. Although the killer' crime spree remain <br />engros (  gross) throughout the novel, the two protagonist <br />credential belie their action  For example, the two witnes   hit <br />  run accident/murder. Despite their train (FBI, Scotland Yard), <br />the best description   the car they   come up     grey, foreign <br />car. A the story progresse  the romance (or sex, rather) eclipse the <br />murder. I dunno    ,       killer wa stalk  , I     <br />more worri   that than   thi cute dude       social <br />clas  Anyway,... Another source   conflict   their detect style  <br />He     hard evidence sort   person   she     profiler - gut   <br />intuition. Despite thi  there   little evidence that she use her <br />profil technique -   certainly   to catch the killer. He <br />eventually come to respect her abilitie - too bad   come     <br />result  , ummmm, well     result   NOTHING. She doe   prove <br />herself     way. In fact, she steadfastly believe the killer to   <br />  different character   the novel than the person   turn out to <br />    the killer. Never mind that the identity   the killer wa <br />obviou (to   anyway) before the first murder even occurr  To   <br />fair, she   seem to   done her homework on the Ripper murder  She <br />chose one theory   provid hard evidence (manufactured)   the truth <br />  her theory. Not necessarily   bad th  I suppose. However,   <br />light   the other shortcoming    wa simply another discordant note <br />that       ignor  So,   I start the book,   wa very <br />interest       good job   draw the readerinto the story. <br />The end wa   bad. The middle     tie the story together   <br />the lack   actual detect wa disappoint

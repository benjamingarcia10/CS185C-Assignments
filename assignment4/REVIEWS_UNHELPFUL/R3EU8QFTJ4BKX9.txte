Thi story start out well. The protagonist i one of the FBI' top <br />profiler and the support character i a detective inspector for <br />Scotland Yard. Essentially, the two are try to track down a modern <br />day Jack the Ripper. Although the killer' crime spree remain <br />engros (and gross) throughout the novel, the two protagonist <br />credential belie their action  For example, the two witnes an hit <br />and run accident/murder. Despite their train (FBI, Scotland Yard), <br />the best description of the car they can come up with i grey, foreign <br />car. A the story progresse  the romance (or sex, rather) eclipse the <br />murder. I dunno about you, but if a killer wa stalk me, I would be <br />more worri about that than whether thi cute dude i in my social <br />clas  Anyway,... Another source of conflict i their detect style  <br />He i a hard evidence sort of person and she i a profiler - gut and <br />intuition. Despite thi  there i little evidence that she use her <br />profil technique - and certainly not to catch the killer. He <br />eventually come to respect her abilitie - too bad it come a a <br />result of, ummmm, well a a result of NOTHING. She doe not prove <br />herself in any way. In fact, she steadfastly believe the killer to be <br />a different character in the novel than the person who turn out to <br />actually be the killer. Never mind that the identity of the killer wa <br />obviou (to me anyway) before the first murder even occurr  To be <br />fair, she did seem to have done her homework on the Ripper murder  She <br />chose one theory and provid hard evidence (manufactured) of the truth <br />of her theory. Not necessarily a bad th  I suppose. However, in <br />light of the other shortcoming  it wa simply another discordant note <br />that could not be ignor  So, when I start the book, it wa very <br />interest and did a good job of draw the readerinto the story. <br />The end wa not bad. The middle did not tie the story together and <br />the lack of actual detect wa disappoint

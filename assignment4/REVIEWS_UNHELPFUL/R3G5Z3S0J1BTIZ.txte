The book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen wa a good book. It wa about a boy, Brian Robeson, whose parent are divorc  He i visit hi dad but the plane crashe and he i stuck in the forest. Brian must hope that someone find him- or else. I thought thi book wa a good one with all of the excitement but I didn't think the character were develop enough. Someone who like adventure book would definitely like thi one.

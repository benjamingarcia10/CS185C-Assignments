The book Stargirl i an amaz story about love and individualism. I enjoy thi book very much, because all the major point made in the story are what really happen in real life. Stargirl wa judg by all of her peer  and in most school  that' what happen to teenager  If you were to read thi story, you would get a whole different view on how to judge people that are unique in their own way  Even though some people can be different, and weird, there' still what' on the inside that count  Jerry Spinelli, the author  of Stargirl, wa very good with gett you involv with the book. He made the people in the story seem real. He also made amaz point about how people are treat all the time, and how you just ne to do your own th  I would recommend thi book to anyone who i judg by either friend or peer  you will all know how Stargirl feel after read thi wonderful story about be unique and enjoy life.

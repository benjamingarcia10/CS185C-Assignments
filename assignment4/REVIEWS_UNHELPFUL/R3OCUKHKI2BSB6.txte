I wa brought into a world of mystical creature and endles game of baseball. Thi book gave me a whole new look on baseball and how life progresse  The first 100 page were a bit slow, but after that I became much more content. Soon conflict arose that puzzl me, a well a fantasy theorie that dazzl my brain. One theory that interest me i that the creature can perform magic u \\"Grammer \\" It i a kind of magic where they only use their brain to do it, and they don't have to say any silly enchantment  They use \\"Grammer to do everyth from float to keep people bound to them for life. I would recommend thi one for teen and adult who are young at heart. Thi i a terrific fantasy novel and i one of the best Ihave read. So pick up the bat, and have a ball with thi fantastic read!

Thi wa the best   the EJD book  I don't think there     storie that   intrigu after   only the first,   the second   third, read. Thi   one   the few. The level   detail   descriptive     wordy or drawn out. The character   well develop   allow the reader to connect on   personal level. Everyone   find   little   themselve     least one character. I   recommend thi book to     anyone. If   offend easily, thi           because   contain scene that     little explicit   language that     little harsh. If     get past that, the storyline   well worth  .

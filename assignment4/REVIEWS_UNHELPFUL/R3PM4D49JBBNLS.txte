Thi wa the best of the EJD book  I don't think there are any storie that are intrigu after not only the first, but the second and third, read. Thi i one of the few. The level of detail i descriptive without be wordy or drawn out. The character are well develop and allow the reader to connect on a personal level. Everyone can find a little of themselve in at least one character. I would recommend thi book to just about anyone. If you offend easily, thi may not be for you because it contain scene that are a little explicit and language that i a little harsh. If you can get past that, the storyline i well worth it.

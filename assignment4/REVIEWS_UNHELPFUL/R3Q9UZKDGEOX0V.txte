Groove, the latest novel by Geneva Holliday (a.k.a. Bernice McFadden), i about the drama-fill live of four friend  Geneva, Crystal, Chevy, and Noah. Geneva i a single mother of a teenag son and i liv paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't help that she also still sleep with her remarri ex-husband. Crystal i the head of a successful non-profit agency. She ha a long-term relationship with her very rich boyfriend Kendrick but soon learn a very dark secret about him that will turn her world upside down. Chevy ha champagne dream on a beer budget. She spend every dime on high-end material thing and i alway one step away from be penniles and homeles  Chevy doesn't care because there' alway a rich man she can snag to finance her lifestyle. But when she get mix up in some illegal activitie  only her friend may be able to save her. Noah i an openly gay male in a long distance relationship. Thing get a little sticky when he start crav and sleep with women.<br /><br />Groove i a nice change of pace for Bernice McFadden, who usually doesn't write \\"mainstream\\" fiction. Sometime when an author decide to breakaway from their normal writ  it doesn't work out. Thi doesn't hold true for thi novelist. Bernice McFadden show her versatility a an author by not only be able to write thought-provok literary work  but entertain  spicy mainstream fiction a well.  Hopefully her reader will give her a chance to expand her horizon and Bernice won't be apprehensive about do more novel like thi in the future.

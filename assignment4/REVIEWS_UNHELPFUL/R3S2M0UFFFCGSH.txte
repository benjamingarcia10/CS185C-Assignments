Emerson' character have alway been memorable, one of the strength of hi writ   However, in the serial character of Thoma Black and Mac Fontana, the storie were largely propell by event outside the character themselve   In stepp away from that world into the stand-alone novel he' writ now, Emerson' skill in characterization come to the fore.  Alway tightly woven and skillfully plott  now hi novel are driven by the character themselve  their daily live  their historie  their trauma  their cop skill (or lack thereof).  A a result, what were enjoyable, fun, well-done if typical genre novel have become rivet and intense tale in their own right. <br /> <br />I'm particularly impres with \\"Pyro.\\" Paul Wollf i a believable and real a hi past is--traumatic and horrific a it turn out to be.  It' particularly impressive that Emerson doesn't try to make hi character \\"nice\\" or apologize for their flaw   He simply turn them loose and let the chip fall where they may, and tell the story a it follow   While I originally found the multiple point of view distract  they were so skillfully handl by Lt. Emerson that it didn't take more than a section or two before each character' insight became indispensible to properly tell the tale.  One or two twist concern the protagonist, Paul Wollf, became obviou to me early on, twist that weren't actually explain until toward the end of the novel.  But I don't believe they were meant to be hidden--and what I thought I knew only increa the tension and kept me even more rivet to the story. <br /> <br />There aren't many book I \\"can't\\" put down, but thi wa one I had to stick with until the end--which wa about 1:15 a.m last night.  I've read and enjoy all of Lt. Emerson' other book  and I won't be unhappy if he doe decide to return to the world of Mac Fontana and Thoma Black in the future.  But \\"Pyro\\" stand head and shoulder above the others--though \\"Into the Inferno\\" i close beside it. <br /> <br />I found Lt. Emerson' novel because of a fondnes for mysterie and a fascination with firefight and firefighter  I've stay because he tell a damn good tale.  He state on hi website that he made the decision to step away from the \\"tri and true\\" formula of hi serie character into the world of \\"stand alone\\" thriller to challenge himself a a writer.  In \\"Pyro,\\" he' not only met the challenge, he' exceed it.

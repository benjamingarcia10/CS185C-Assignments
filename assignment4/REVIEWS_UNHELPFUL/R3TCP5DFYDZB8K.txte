For thi to be a fiction book the writer i certainly a talent and visionary soul. I wa stunn a I read and didn't have to work to imagine each and every scene; it wa almost a if I wa right there with Steven, Julie and Fallon a they wen't through thi all. The scene that got to me wa the wedd when Julie show up and said what she said. I wa so angry with her that I through the book acros the room. I couldn't imagine what I would've done if I wa Fallon. That said, thi book will make you laugh, cry and even scream out at time  That' how you know the writer i a tremendou talent. I would love to see thi a a movie!

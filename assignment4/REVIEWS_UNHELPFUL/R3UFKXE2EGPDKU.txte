I enjoy read thi book, although there were some element I found irritat  First, the irritat bit  The prose ha no break or chapter  the conversation occur over the course of three day  Surely at least each day warrant a chapter or section.  <br /> <br />The story doe not use quotation marking  Thi I can see because the narrative i 99% one character. There are periodic quote from a listener with no visual designation a such, and thi wa mildly confu  but I can see the reason for the absence of quotation  I recall Ann Rice' \\"Interview with a Vampire,\\" (a completely different type of book) where quotation were u and it really got to be quite troublesome to navigate them all, in my opinion.  <br /> <br />Aside from the lack of quotation  the story i really a monologue by one character, whom to me, seem very full of himself in dominat so very much of the conversation. I found thi irritat  a selfish trait thi character had, who even admit he loathe people who talk too much. Who wa thi listener, who remain nameles and without personality? I felt like I want to know who thi listener wa  I don't think though, the story suffer greatly from it be told in thi way; to me it wa just a bit irritat   <br /> <br />One other little th I did not like wa some area that to me seem like filler or fluff - irrelevant discussion of other element of the speaker' life. Some thing like detail of other member of hi family, hi wife' family, even hi father' death, seem like they belong in another story. Thi story i about adultery. Let' keep it focu  To me, even in a novel, just about every word count  The speaker i a writer, and he even admit that writer add thi filler i not someth he like   <br /> <br />A for what I found strong in thi story: For one, I believe the end i just right. I wa expect some drama, hop it wa not too much, hop it wa consistent and believable. It wa  It warrant a sequel so we can learn more.  <br /> <br />I lik some small passage of text, one that stick out, and i reminiscent of Cheever, i \\"I may go to a museum or an afternoon movie, the latter though very seldom because I am afraid of be taken for one of those men who go alone to the movie mainly to rub their elbow against the woman in the next seat.\\" Wonderful.  <br /> <br />The story i gripp and maintain my interest; I want to know how the predicament wa resolv  I am hop the author i consider a follow-up.

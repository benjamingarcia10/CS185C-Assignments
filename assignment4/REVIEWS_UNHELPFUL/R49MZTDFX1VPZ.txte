I think we've all seen the toys-come-to-life-when-we're-not-around fantasy in roughly 70 million different form of media over the year   Far les common, but no les a part of children' daily live  are storie in which kid pretend to be superheroe   They exist, but few are so carefully thought out and amusingly illustrat a George \\"First Book\\" O'Connor.  Choo to present hi picture book in a graphic novel style (and earn himself a mention at the New York 2005 Book Fest a a result) \\"Kapow!\\" i a novel tell of three kid  their world of make-believe, and the consequence of major roughhou   It' not a particularly original idea or a huge departure from already exist picture book superhero tale (like \\"The Adventure of Sparrowboy\\" or \\"Traction Man I Here!\\"), but it' probably go to be VERY belov of certain children in certain household <br /><br />A small boy i play with hi block when, with a simple removal of hi jacket, he become the muscly chin-cleft American Eagle.  Join up with fellow superhero Bug Lady, the two ignore hi mother' warn against gett too into their play and trap a dangerou panther (or housecat, depend on how you look at it) in a cage (washbasket).  Then it' off to stop The Rubber Bandit from robb the First National Bank.  At thi point, however, thing get a little too crazy.  In the midst of the heroe epic battle a bookcase plummet to the floor.  Now it' up to American Eagle to do someth actually heroic.  Will he tell the truth to hi mom, or will he succumb to the temptation to lie?  Tune in to learn more thi week in the excit picture book extravaganza, \\"Kapow!\\".<br /><br />Like fellow fearles cartoony illustrator Kevin O'Malley (author of \\"Lucky Leaf\\" amongst others), Mr. O'Connor i not afraid to place hi story within a contemporary sett   Some author/illustrator chicken out when it come to book of thi nature and feel safer plac their story in the 1950  or some such sillines   O'Connor, however, isn't afraid to contemporize hi tale.  The mom of the American Eagle kid remind me a little of the mom in Bob Graham'  \\"Let' Get a Pup, Said Kate\\" but with les tattoo   And she' still do laundry, so don't expect any break from stereotypical gender role or anyth   There are fun little detail within the seemingly straightforward story though.  While the book never come on out and say it, I suspect that the poor kid wrangl into be the Rubber Bandit i probably American Eagle' little brother.  Try remov the cover and compar the picture underneath to the one print on the cover too.  Also, I wa happy to find that American Eagle' duckish baseball cap never change expression, though the mouth below it (hi mouth) might.<br /><br />The leap between view these heroe a spandex-wrapp adult and costume-laden kid will be enough in and of themselve to garner a fan base.  It' nice to note that the story i a pretty amu one a well.  Though it doesn't do anyth particularly new or original, thi i bound to help get Cartoon Network junkie into the whole read th   A useful book.such sillines   O'Connor, however, isn't afraid to contemporize hi tale.

Patterson write so many book these day that none of them are an \\"event\\" or anyth special.  Still, thi novel manage to stand out from the rest.   <br /> <br />N Kelly i the main character on the run from the FBI for a crime he didn't commit (and a few that he did).  The plot involve wealthy old men, stolen art, childhood friend and criminal past that come back to haunt Kelly.   <br /> <br />There are plenty of twist and turn and a satisfy  believable end   My only complaint i the ease in which the FBI agent fell for a loser like Kelly

I thought Emily Barr did a wonderful job of gett into the mind of a woman.  The insecuritie  the emotional game  the love we have for our children no matter how hard it i   I'm go to make my husband read it so maybe he will understand me and my crazy mind a little better.  I also great for realiz how the little thing can be huge blessing

Thi i by far one of the most outstand piece of literature i've ever had the pleasure of read  I would have to say my only negative thought i that it rip me out of my terminal state of uniquenes  It' the first th i've ever read that tell my story grow up to a T. I remember vividly some of the same exact thought the protagonist encounter (and even some of the same events). A oddly close to my own experience it may be, thi book finnaly put an answer to that eternal question i've had of &quot;what happen to her?&quot; And what exactly I could do about it. <BR>You have to read it to find out.

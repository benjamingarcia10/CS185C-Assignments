The book wa   great read, couldn't put   down UNTIL I got close to the end   then I felt like the book fell apart.  Wa there   penalty   add   few more page     little bit more story?  It seem the author took the 3 essential subject   the book; Nora, the bos   the ex-wife     threw together   end   I felt like I wa   dropp   It wa very disappoint

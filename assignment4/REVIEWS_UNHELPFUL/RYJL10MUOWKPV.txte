The book wa a great read, couldn't put it down UNTIL I got close to the end and then I felt like the book fell apart.  Wa there a penalty for add a few more page and a little bit more story?  It seem the author took the 3 essential subject in the book; Nora, the bos and the ex-wife and just threw together an end   I felt like I wa just dropp   It wa very disappoint

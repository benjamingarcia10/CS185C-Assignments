ASIN B0007E0UUY - The word are short and easy to read for young children and repeat some word several time throughout the book make it an extra easy read. There' almost a Dr. Sues sound to it, a you read, but the rhyme you expect never happen. If you can find a copy, read it on Christma morn - the day you re-learn that the box the gift came in i often cooler than the gift.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

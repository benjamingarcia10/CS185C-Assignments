His arguments are clear, well-written, and funny. He puts all others of his ilk to shame (including liberals and conservatives). This is a must read for every American. At times, his jokes can be hard to distinguish from what he's trying to pass off as truth, and that is the only negative aspect of the book. For the most part, if you have any kind of sarcasm detector, you can catch when he's joking. High recommended.	2005-10-14

I read the book expecting another predictable Michael Moore-like diatribe, and... needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised. From the sheer quality of journalism in the book, to the frequent admissions of error and fallibility, to the poignant and honest treatment of oftentimes liberal punching-bag Bob Jones University, I got the sense that this book was written by someone who was genuinely interested in the truth, and not simply out to make a point. Franken also says much about the state of the media in general that is of extreme importance if the American democracy is to remain healthy. <br /> <br />I, as some reviewers before me, failed to get much from the more theatrical elements of the book (such as the Vietnam story - although the mental image of some of the protagonists grunting, knee-dep in mud, held a certain amount of satisfaction); also, the constant name-calling and profanity, although understandable in light of the revelations, made Franken a too-easy target for accusations of hypocrisy (a Kurt Vonnegut quote from \\"Hocus Pocus\\" comes to mind - that profanity makes it all too easy for one's opponents to ignore one's message). <br /> <br />Overall, though, this was a very well-researched and well-written book; instead of preaching to the choir, Franken has produced an argument that applies even to people who don't share his convictions. <br /> <br />P.S. See the piece by \\"Intilleviasileanis\\" a couple of entries below, on how NOT to review a book.	2005-09-11

I used to enjoy watching Al Franken on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" and he was always a good writer (as well as performer) on the television show. The first time I recall seeing him was in the comedy \\"Trading Places,\\" starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. I never expected the guy playing the dumb security guard to write a book as intelligent and witty as this. <br /> <br />I'll outline my complaints first, because it's always good to be over with the bad before delving into the \\"good.\\" <br /> <br />For one, I didn't personally approve of Al Franken's continual plugs and self-praise. I understand a certain portion of it is simply his comedic shtick (like Chevy Chase before he lost his sense of humor, part of Franken's base humor derives from acting arrogant) - but nonetheless it's rather grating and does portray Franken in a lesser light. I counted at least five references to other books he wrote, and in one or two chapters he encourages readers to go buy one of his older books (\\"...it's still in print,\\" he says). <br /> <br />Two, I found his constant belittling of the right-wing party offensive at times. Of course he's a liberal, and for the most part he avoids the stupid \\"he-said-she-said\\" arguments that highlight the media these days (an aspect of which helped me enjoy this book even more), but it's still there. For the most part he avoids slamming conservatives in general, and instead goes after specific party leaders; but a few of his \\"attacks\\" were a bit strong. And also, I think it's kind of funny that Franken claims the media is not liberal by nature - FOX is one of the only networks to be accused of being right-wing, and why is this? Because most other networks report from a liberal perspective.  <br /> <br />Here's another way of looking at it - name all the conservative actors in Hollywood. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Adam Sandler, Gary Oldman... and that's about it (at least in terms of popular actors). Now, count how many liberals are in Hollywood. Hmm... Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Billy Crystal, Martin Scorsese - these names off the top of my head. The list goes on forever. In fact, everyone on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" is a liberal. It's ironic that, during his days as a staffmember on the show, Al never stopped and realized, \\"Hey, everyone in the media is a liberal like me.\\" <br /> <br />I'm not trying to \\"prove\\" anything, just saying that I disagreed with Al's opinion on this matter (I think statistics would probably reveal most actors, directors, writers and news reporters are librals) - Al claims all the \\"higher ups\\" are mostly conservative, but by the time the news passes down to the anchors, they'll deliver their perspective. A good example is a recent broadcast on a local news station, where - after detailing one of Bush's latest blunders - the anchorman made a sarcastic remark about Bush. If the media were truly conservative in nature, it would never happen as often as it does. <br /> <br />Nevertheless Al manages to prove good points about Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. I really enjoyed the book, found myself agreeing with it more than I expected. <br /> <br />What I admired most is that Al doesn't throw insults around like so many other writers are today. Sure, some of his chapters sound offensive at first - but once you start reading them you'll realize it's just to be funny and the actual content is far from insulting. <br /> <br />The book is well-written, informative and offers a fresh, intellectual stance on politics. I highly recommend it to liberals and conservatives alike.	2005-08-25

I was interested in reading this book because I am tired of, and not a little alarmed by, the extreme right wing movement that has been pervading the media and politics in this country. The average citizen, like you or I, is not in a position to counter the distortions and manipulations of the truth that are being foisted on the American public. So I had high hopes that Mr. Franken's book would do just that. <br /> <br />While he does do an admirable job of countering misrepresentations with facts, he also allows himself to fall into the name calling, character assassination, and meanness that is the shameful calling card of the people he is opposing. He surrenders the high ground, when that high ground is his strongest weapon. Had he simply stuck to comedy and facts I think that the book would have been much better.	2005-08-12

While Al Franken is doing what the title implies- picking apart lies and propaganda from particular right wing figures- he's great. Showing Ann Coulter is a liar may not take a genius to do, but few people can do it with Franken's level of wit. But when he commentates on the larger political picture, and issues not tied to individual people, Franken is just another partisan. It's not that he's a Michael Moore style, sensationalism-over-sense jerk. He's more reasonable than that. But he usually fails to rise above or add much unique perspective to the common complaints and positions of the left. And speaking of Moore,  I would really like a book that discredits lies through satire but includes a few left-wing extremists in the crossfire as well.	2005-07-11

This is as good as any political book around these days.Franken is a crystal clear thinker and an articulate writer.I you want to know how and what a liberal stands for and how they think;you could not find a better person to explain their philosophy to you.The candidates who competed for the opportunity to lead the fight to dethrone Bush in 2004,as well as those now jockeying for position to regain power in the White House,Senate and Congress in 2008 couldn't and can't hold a candle to one of the most talanted exponents of liberalism around today.As you will learn in this book,unlike running for cover,when conservatives are around;Franken stands right up straight and confronts them head on.More than that he goes looking for them.<br />He doesn't follow the path of old dyed-in- the wool of both parties and put together a support team of political hacks,big names from business,party theorists,political organizers,etc.He 'takes the road less travelled'and creates a TeamFranken organization of fair and balanced thinkers,with integrity, with Harvard backgrounds;whose only purpose being to expound the truth and foster the goals of liberalism.<br /> So,why isn't he a major candidate or at least spokesman for the Democratic Party?He continually exposes the conservatives and their agendas,all in a manner that leaves them looking like a heap of fallen leaves in the autumn.You don't see the other shining lights doing this do you?They just cry and weep complaining they were victimised or misunderstood.No siree!,you don't get that from Al!

This book does a great job illustrating how lies are formed and perpetuated in the media and by conservative pundits. The book is focused and sensical.

To start with, this book is very funny, provided you're a liberal. I am a very left-wing liberal who read this book largely to avoid having a nervous breakdown over the disastrous direction I feel this country is taking. I left it feeling slightly unsatisfied, because while I loved the hilarious lampooning of reckless conservatism and its public figures, I also knew that Franken had only given one side of the story and had done only a mediocre job disguising what he was doing. I can't force myself to read the garbage that Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity put out because I think I would be so enraged and offended by their views that I couldn't get past page 2, but I wish someone would write an actually balanced book, which is extremely difficult in this day and age because our government is doing such a great job of polarizing the nation with its \\"for us or against us\\" mentality. Franken's book just adds to the problem. Although he spends about half the book bragging how good his research and fact-checking are, which gets beyond boring, he's so obviously far-left as to raise inevitable suspicions. I thought his ruse about pretending to be interested in Bob Jones University was inappropriate. I also think that if he was intending to convert conservatives to his way of thinking with his book, he will fail. The book is too inflammatory to reach out to anyone, largely because of the overuse of expletives attached to conservative figures. I despise Karl Rove just as he does, but his book really preaches to the choir. However, it was extremely entertaining to read and I enjoyed the experience, although the whole thing is slightly overdone.	2005-03-25

I don't think there is a soul out there that can disprove any of what Franken is saying because he lays such a solid foundation upon what he writes. This book is definitely a new weapon for liberal thinkers to advance their idea of neutral media bias.	2005-02-04

True conservatives will agree that the corporate-owned media facade bombards us with distortions and lies propagated by the Straussian-influenced neo-liberals (neocons) .  The media used to be like a fourth branch of government; a check and balance, a call for accountability and accuracy of information.  Now, with little exception, it is just a propaganda mechanism of questionably elected or appointed shills.  Do yourself a favor and flip off Fox News.	2005-02-01

I've read other reviews on this book, and I have made some conclusions. That most of the people who hated this book are people who had different opinions than Al does (thats no surprise) Then they make a big deal that content in this book not hundred percent true. So what, its nothing different than what crap Bill O'Reily, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh put out. And lastly, If you knew that Al Franken was a liberal, and you the reader is a conservative and you know that both your and Franken's opinions are gonna be different, WHY READ THE DAMN BOOK? Overall, I loved the book, my father is a huge fan of his and I just got into reading his books with Why Not Me, and Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot. This book totally tells its reader what it needs to hear.	2005-01-20

I know I'm echoing some of the other reviews here, but I just couldn't put this book down! I've never been a big fan of Franken's, but he's a pretty good writer I'd have to say. <br /> <br />Franken goes after some of the big \\"talking heads\\" of the right -- Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity; he mentions Rush Limbaugh too, but he already devoted an entire book to him. <br /> <br />I think most will enjoy Franken's fictional Vietnam story. I haven't laughed that well in a while! The \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" made some good points too. <br /> <br />Of course, the main thrust of the work was to expose how right-wing pundits aren't 'purveyors of truth'. Franken is at his best in dissecting the statements of Sean Hannity, the over-the-top hysterics of Ann Coulter, and the 'spin' that Bill O'Reilly actually puts into his show. I would certainly recommend this book to fans of these three -- if only to discover how you're being taken.	2005-01-06

What I was not expecting was for it to be so well supported.  Franken has done his research and documented every allegation he makes (read lie he exposes) in this.  The individual lies themselves may not amount to much, but collectively they say a lot about the conservative media:  it seems bent on expressing what it wants the public to perceive as the truth rather than the truth itself.  What's wrong with the truth?  \\"You can't handle the truth\\" -  Is that right?  Or ... er... um....  <br /> <br />What reading this book unwittingly instilled in me was a requirement for documentation.  Currently, I am reading \\"Misunderestimated\\" by Bill Sammon and it's a TERRIBLE read - not because it exalts GWB to sainthood, but because there's not a single thread of evidentiary support in what Sammon writes.  Not one.  I might be able to accept this more if this book was sold as opinion, but it's touted as something more than opinion; it's touted as being \\"true\\" -- and therein lies the problem.  At least Franken takes claim for the lies he tells in his own book - and, in that case, they are clearly done in humor.  But in a book like Sammon's, where there's not even an index to list the documentation he claims to have...  it's insulting; insulting to anyone, I suspect, but the die-hard Right wingers to whom such books are geared anyway. <br /> <br />I would have given Franken's book 5 Stars, but he resorts to some pretty foul language and ridicule when it isn't necessary.  This is unfortunate, as otherwise this text could be used as a teaching tool w/ youngsters coming of political age.   <br /> <br />Highly recommended read.   <br />	2004-12-30

I am a registered Democrat and a self-labeled bleeding heart liberal, so I really enjoyed this book.  I don't think my enjoyment stemmed out of any deep political analysis or intellect on Al Franken's part, but probably more out of a sense of Schadenfreude to see the short-comings of the pundits on the other side exposed. <br /> <br />To really enjoy this book, I think you need to go in, as a liberal, with the mindset that 1) you already know what you believe and 2) you already know who you do and do not like.  This isn't a book for learning as much as it is a book for reaffirming, like all partisan books on politics.  So if you like quasi-profane rants (and as a college student, I can honestly say I do) and the deconstruction of right-wing nuts like O'Reilly and Coulter, this book should give you a chuckle. <br /> <br />I only have two issues with this book: 1) Franken spends quite a bit of time lamenting the horrible partisan tone that exists in our two party system, but then seems to subscribe to a \\"if you can't beat them, join them\\" philosophy of dealing with it, and 2) considering that this is a book like Coulter or O'Reilly would write (though intentionally funny and less shrill), there is always that concern of how Franken is using the facts he presents.  He continuously touts the depths of his team's research and fact-checking, but there is always that doubt.  That keeps me from giving the book 5 stars.	2004-12-11

I feel that despite the fact Franken uses his wit, he is dead-on, regarding his debunking  Hannity, Coulter and O'Reilly. Coulter- how can you trust a woman who can't even properly 'end note' her supposed sources of information.<br /><br />So many people have ripped apart her books by finding that she misquotes sources or has no source at all. Coulter could not even defend her book on Chris Matthews. He gave her every opportunity and she could not back up her statements. Hannity- Franken tells us what we already know; Hannity is a Rush protege. Hannity is more consumed with hating Democrats ( not liberals, but Democrats ) that he flip flops his positions to suit his needs. Kosovo vs Iraq? Well, he showed no support for Clinton and was quite disrespectful on air with his usual name calling and ad hominem attacks. Iraq- people who disagree are called 'unpatriotic.' Franken shows many examples where Hannity can't get his story straight.O'Reilly- What was his background and where did he come from and how is he registered to vote? O'Reilly it seems has made up a new past- a hard working, struggling blue collar past. O'Reilly's own mother debunked him by being interviewed and talked more about his private school upbringing, many family vacations, etc... No struggling. Or lying about what he said on air. I believe O'Reilly thinks that transcripts of him can't be found that easily. The biggest selling point is that Franken shows that when backed into a corner- these people are bullies. How many times have we heard Hannity and O'Reilly yell, \\"Shut up.\\" I highly recommend this book to anyone- I also challenge readers and watchers and listeners of Coulter, Hannity and O'Reilly to cross check the info they spout. You'll be surprised how many errors you can find. It is the only way to be fair and objective.	2004-12-05

I tell you, Al had me laughing at 4 am with no sleep, no bed, sitting on a concrete park bench surrounded by bums and drug pushers in Rome. It's safe to say Al was my hotel for the night. He kept my spirit aflame. <br /> <br />I think there's a special place in my heart for guys like Al; guys who can sit down and really sift through the soup and get down to the meat of an argument. I've been in too many political arguments with know-nothing blowhards and have lost because they decide to conjure up a new false statistic to prove their case. Al treats the truth how it should be treated, with care. Yes, many of the lies revealed in this book could be considered inconsequential, petty, or harmless BUT lies nonetheless. Lies upon lies upon lies create a smokescreen hiding the reality. By noting this himself, he brings out the truth in the matter: The media is playing telephone, and by the time it gets to us normal everyday citizens, it's distorted, incomplete, and sometimes just plain wrong. What happened to the day when newscasters and media personalities prided themselves in getting it right? Isn't that how we should judge these guys. I'm gonna barf the next time I hear \\"Senate Republicans say...\\" or \\"Environmentalists charge...\\" Who cares what they claim! Is it true? <br /> <br />Great read.	2004-12-01

I also loved his commentary on past presidential elections for Comedy Central. Up until now I didn't have the time to read his books. I recently picked up his recent book \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\". I quickly found myself laughing out loud at some of the stuff that Al writes, especially about my 'favorite' media gadfly Ann Coulter. Like Michael Moore, Al Franken is a magnet for ugly criticisms from conservatives. Although Al does have a tendency to be a bit venomous at times towards conservatives, what stands out for me in this book is the amount of research and the members of TeamFranken do for this book. I thought the chapters on Ann Coulter really showcased the amount of researched they did. Michael Moore on the other hand has a tendency to makes really outrageous (but hilarious) statements and his writing sounds more like an editorial in the op-ed section of my local newspaper. My personal favorite chapter is chapter 5 \\"Loving America the Al Franken Way\\" when Al makes a list of America's history. I couldn't help but laugh. I also loved it when Al had taken Bernie Goldberg to task in chapter 6. Al makes a really good point when he says that the only bias in the media is purely based on sensationalism and attracting big ratings for the network. Why else would the news networks would talk nothing more than about sex, violence, and death? Because those topics sells with the general public. Why else would MSNBC be so fascinated with the Scott Peterson case? The story has been sensationalized by the media ala OJ Simpson. Same with former president Bill Clinton and former intern Monica Lewinsky. Sex sells in the media. The major networks are simply trying to attract big ratings which Al argues in the book. I found \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" very entertaining and informative from my perspective.	2004-11-10

If you liked the Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat, Pumpkin Head book, you'll love this one.  The difference is that Liars is more focused and on point then big fat pumpkin head. It doesn't veer off target. It's always a bullseye throughout when it comes to information about how the Republican Right is lying to America (thanks to the help of Franken's Harvard assistants and researchers).  Yet at the same time, it is laugh out loud funny. You know the old saying, \\"Dying is easy, comedy is hard.\\"  I never laugh out loud, except once a week when I watch Bill Mahr.  But I sat on the can and laughed my ass off reading it.      Coincidentally, my brother who is a moron (and no coincidence, a Republican) independently bought this book, laughed his ass off, called me and told me about it right after I finished the book.  He loved it too.  So much in fact, that 2 weeks later, he voted for George Bush (See, I told you that he was a moron).  Anyway, great book, great info, non-stop laughs.

Franken states he is very \\"statistically\\" oriented, and in this book he does present a wealth a statistical info to support his thesis which is that the \\"facts\\" that the right presents the american public just dont match reality or are presented in a way to mislead.

About all I can suggest is that you read this book back to back with Richard Clarkes AGAINST ALL  ENEMIES. Franken is very passionate, and when he does descend to opinion, it is totally on the mark, as well as being entertaining.  The one method that I like a lot with Franken, is that he does look at the right's material; it is not like he whips up the material from nothing... key example in this point is the \\"I (...)SLAP BERNIE...\\"   chapter.  Nothing Franken says contradicts Clarkes detailed work, and I would recommend these books as a duo.    Franken's method is solid, as well as entertaining, a trait that I wish other politicians would follow more often.	2004-10-12

Especially now that he is the host of his own radio show on Air America (which also airs every night on the Sundance channel, with a lovely co-host I might add).  <br /> <br />He is the antithesis of everything that's wrong with Limbaugh. Speaking politically. As for the comedic 'factor', well, not even his best friend O'Reilly can touch him with his fantasy island redux masquerading as fair and balanced commentary.  <br /> <br />I only like to watch *O'Really* to see what his word of the month calendar has taught him. Let's see, he was stuck on 'opine' for a while. Now it's 'bloviate'- (such a choice word he has brought to the masses, so [as his French friend -(read: one- speaking optimistically, of course)- would say] a propos) - bloviate this, send me an email but don't bloviate 'cause that's *my* job, of course if you wish to 'opine' (I think he still recycles that oldie but goodie).  <br />But, damn I've digressed and turned this Al Franken review to an O'Reilly bloviation. How leftist of me. &#60;snicker&#62; <br /> <br />Now to this book, I read it at about the time it came out and just finished re-reading it to compare it to oh, about 20 books I've read on the vast right-wing conspiracy (I wish *that* was a joke) and have to absolutely endorse this tome' as one of the first and one of the best at exposing exactly what the title states.  Another point for Al is that even though I'm a big Noam Chomsky and Cornel West fan you don't have to sacrifice your hard earned evening solace and ruin that second glass of wine by concentrating to the extent that these aforementioned author's literature require.  No slight meant for either party.  Factor (ha) it to Al's comedic background. Now if we could change the constitution to make it a prerequisite to be a SNL alumnus in order to run for public office, we could do away with road rage.  But another digress and discussion for that.

I have caught myself watching Hannity, O'Reilly, as well as getting Limbaugh on the radio dial from time to time.  But, it wasn't until I actually read some of the reviews on this book right here by the people who seem to be big fans of the aforementioned conservative radio/tv show hosts that I decided to buy this book.  After reading some of these reviews and seeing just how mad these people had gotten at Franken... I had to give him a chance as well as O'Reilly and a book I wish I would have never read by Ann Coulter. <br /> <br />To see him bait these conservatives relentlessly... and to see it work! is some of the funniest reading I have ever come across.  If you are sick of the slant on Fox News or people like Bush, Cheney, Rove, Wolfowitz, Hannity, Limbaugh, Coulter, ... I can go on and on... this is what seems a rarity (a look at the other side).  Franken does a great job showing that the myth of liberal media bias is really the other way around.  He also points out (with facts... not speculation) some of the lies that Bush has made... The one knock I will give him is his support is almost as blind and unfaltering as the same people from the right that I mentioned above.  He does point out mistakes which gives him alot more credibility than any of those above, however I would like a less biased approach.  Reading this book late at night... I actually woke my wife up because I was laughing so hard on several occasions.  Which makes it a lot more interesting than the books I have read from Coulter (who I sincerely believe would be a member of the Nazi Party if she thought they had a chance to win) or O'Reilly's book (who at times can really bring up some good points but drives me nuts when I hear him say he is an independant and then mentions to his guests that they should be republican like him).   <br /> <br />Coulter is a Nazi, O'Reilly is a liar, Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot (my nextbook).  Franken is insightful, however slanted, and completely hillarios.  Highly recommended for those of you on either side of the fence with a sense of humor.  My mother is a huge fan of O'Reilly and thought this book was hillarious.  If anyone knows of some conservative books that are well written (not propoganda)... let me know.  It would be greatly appreciated, so far the closest I have come is O'Reilly and frankly... he gets caught in too many lies for me to give him any serious thought.	2004-09-29

It's also clear that many people don't know how to be objective when it comes to reviewing a book that obviously polarizes people along party lines. Perhaps people are missing the point of the book (in my opinion): Franken feels that this book was required to counteract the right wing bias that he feels is active in the media. The fact that it exists at all (coupled with the reviews found on this website) indicates that politics in this country has been reduced to an 'us against them' mentality (a mentality that Bush seems to have embraced at the international level at least).  <br />I also suspect that the books inherent irony is double edged i.e. Franken doesn't take himself too seriously as a political pundit-is this book really THE truth? ofcourse not.But then again, neither are the conservative books that Franken cites.I, for one, intend to read one of Hannity's books to get his version of THE truth-I'm sure I won't like it, but here's a novel thought-perhaps they both contain factual information! <br />Ultimately,I think the discourse that is generated by books such as this does little to address the underlying problem that pervades politics today: in a complicated world such as this having one of only 'two views' is just not going to cut it anymore.	2004-09-25

(I have no political association, read the book on a friend's recommendation, and laughed aloud quite a bit.  Further, I don't even know who some of the people in the book are, and it's still funny.) <br />-This book is well-documented. (There are claims that the book isn't true like in [...]  But, there are also claims that the naysayers are lying, like in frankenlies.blogspot.com.  I invite people to read both sites and determine for themselves which site seems more superficial and one-sided, and which site seems to take a more reasonable and careful analysis to the whole thing.) <br />-This book does criticize people for lying.  But, the critiques do seem to be well grounded.  (This seems especially true since most of the claims made by the book's main contester, [...] contest minor inaccuracies by Franken, and not the real meat and potatoes lying.) <br />-This book is well-written.  It's not well-written in the sense that Noam Chomsky's \\"Hegemony or Survival,\\" say, is well-written.  But, it's written in an easy-reading style with jokes and wit thrown in, i.e. easy bedtime reading. <br /> <br />So, I am continuing with my friend's initial recommendation and also recommending this book to you.  But, I must qualify the recommendation.  If you are a blind-faither political person, you will probably not like this book.  If you are a right blind-faither, you'll probably unilaterally dismiss whatever Al says as bunk.  If you are a left blind-faither, you will probably unilaterally agree with whatever Al says without question.  If you are a non-political person or don't really know which party you belong to, you'll probably enjoy this book the most.	2004-09-22

But take away the jokes, the lambastings, the burlesques, and the comics (there actually are comic strips in the book, one featuring a \\"Supply-Side Jesus\\") and what we have left is comedian Al Franken yelling at the Right.<br /><br />Mr. Franken, onetime Saturday Night Live regular, reveals himself here (and elsewhere of course) as a kind of liberal version of the AM radio talk show host turned author.  Like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, et. al, Franken seems obsessed with something he attributes to those on the other side of the aisle, in this case the telling of falsehoods.  That people like Limbaugh, Coulter, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, George W., Dick Chaney, etc., lie would hardly seem noteworthy, yet Franken has constructed an entire book (with the gofer and research help of some young people from Harvard whom he dubs \\"TeamFranken\\"--photo on page 368 with mini-bios following) that chronicles and exposes their lies while he lampoons them to death (almost literally).<br /><br />What I think Franken had in mind here was a new kind of journalism: what you do is present the facts about the miscreants along with ironic exaggerations, sarcasm, SNL and Mad Magazine shtick, and what you get is an expos&eacute; that's fun to read and affords the reader plenty of belly laughs along with the indignation.  What he sometimes reveals, especially when he waxes maudlin, is the true bleeding heart of a liberal letting it all hang out, as in the chapter on the memorial for Minnesota's Democratic Senator Paul Wellstone.<br /><br />In this endeavor I give Franken a gentlemen's \\"B\\" while noting that if you're on the right this is decidedly NOT a funny book (except perhaps for the tasteless joke about Elton John on page 158).  Otherwise, some of this may be very funny.  If you're the kind of person who actually listens to Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly (why you would want to do that, I don't know--or I should say, HOW you can do that, I don't know), then this will read like a subversive plot to destroy everything sacred in America by some foul-mouth comedian released from his namby-pamby inhibitions, if he had any.<br /><br />I heard about \\"Lies...\\" while listening to NPR's Terry Gross interviewing Bill O'Reilly who was whining about the book and how he was depicted therein, especially his \\"splotchy\\" pix on the cover.  He later whined about how Terry Gross treated him before he walked out on her, claiming that she was a lot nicer to Al Franken when she interviewed him.  I heard that interview too, and it was clear that, doggone it, she did like Franken better.  (I think she couldn't help herself.)<br /><br />Anyway, by now everybody knows the story of how \\"Lies...\\" became a #1 Bestseller thanks to Fox News suing Franken for his use of what they thought was their propriety slogan \\"Fair and Balanced\\" in his title.  The resulting publicity vaulted Franken to the top.  Curious minds (like mine) wanted to know what the stink was all about.  Hey, guys at Fox, smooth move.<br /><br />All right.  All right.  I got too much in the spirit of things there.  Sorry.  Anyway, \\"Fair and Balanced\\" this book is not, and of course Franken used the phrase ironically and as a special dig at the right-wing leaning Fox News people.  He really does have a...bee in his bonnet, if you will, about those shock jocks on the right.  Perhaps he asked himself, How many AM radio talk shows are hosted by liberals?  Try something like close to zero, or zay'row as the French say.  That's nada, and you want to know why?  Because people on the left are different from people on the right.  People on the left like to think of themselves as above such Neanderthal hate-mongering, slogan-yelling, pseudo-righteous blathering and bullying; instead you will find them tuned discretely to NPR or the BBC or catching the latest feminist play at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.  As for real doctrinaire lefties of the bleeding heart variety they can be found listening to Pacifica radio as it spins multicultural music and first person reports from the disadvantaged in Palestine or the jungles of South America.  Liberals do NOT rant and rave or tell barnyard jokes in public. Please.<br /><br />So I don't know how well this will sit with people on the left.  (People on the right will burn it along with their Dixie Chicks CDs.)  But I would like to make an observation.  Most successful political books are highly partisan, and they have a predictable readership: people on the right want it spelled out that liberals are commies and traitors, etc., while people on the left want it noted that George W. was a drunk, dodged serving in Vietnam, and is so immoral that he is giving the US treasury to his friends at Halliburton (that's with two \\"l's\\", taxpayers), Big Oil, Big Pharma, etc., while waging a stupid war for self-aggrandizement and the photo opportunity in fighter pilot gear aboard an aircraft carrier.  So popular political books tend to be one-sided.  This one is no exception.<br /><br />Another thing: doctrinaire conservatives and doctrinaire liberals are swayed not one iota by argument because their beliefs are religious beliefs, held regardless of evidence.  I think the genetic pool of the human species includes genes that can be expressed for change or against change, depending on the early experience of the individual, and these left and right inclinations are not rationally held but are largely genetic.  Ask yourself, have you ever seen a dyed-in-the-wool conservative or liberal swayed by rational argument or the preponderance of evidence?<br /><br />I didn't think so.

But at least in this book he explains why he has these problems, and you should too. He dissects some of the arguments and charges of the right.

Frankin is clearly much more than your average SNL comedian. He's thoughtful, articulate and makes many interesting points. While I don't have the time to research all of his references (as he did with Ann Coulter and others) and thus can't say that I totally believe everything he says, I am impressed by his real drive to use good sound research in backing up his points. I am a current college student who knows how essential it is to do good research in making any kind of substantial argument, and I compliment Frankin on sharing this view himself. Just remember fellow readers, anytime you make overwhelming statements like \\"Al Frankin is 100% wrong\\" you're already robbing yourself of any agrumentitive validity. To the same degree, to say that 100% of what Bill O'Reilly says is a lie is equally as self-defeating. There are no such things as complete objective truths in this post-modernist world; though some arguments can be objectively better than others based on the methods which led to their conclusions. For the most part, I have been encouraged by Mr. Frankin's methods and look forward to future debates between himself and the 'Lying Lyers' he so frequently refers to.	2004-09-09

As a political op-ed however, he doesn't put forth why he thinks the right are just lying, racist hate mongers and why his alternative is better. He simply enjoys attempting to make them look foolish. If you like to bash the righ wing, this book is for you. If you want a \\"Fair and Balanced\\" look at the right, then you need to look elsewhere.  The one think I enjoy about Al Franken's books are that they are funny.  I don't think it's the place to go to learn.

Also we know very little of the various congressmen mentioned, rendering parts of the book incomprehensible. <br /> <br />The book does hit its targets well, exposing the mendacity and plain lack of decency of the Right from the monstrous Ann Coulter to Bush himself. It's also very funny, particularly the chapter which is outsourced to Bangladesh, although the \\"Chickenhawks\\" episode would have been better left out and \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" though sharp and funny is perhaps irrelevant to the main argument. <br /> <br />Franken is a Clinton supporting liberal and therefore the politics of the book are limited, although this is probably a strength in its intended role of populist polemic. The likes of Chomsky have done a better job of deconstructing the way the mass media define the agenda and condition political thought. But of course Chomsky isn't funny. <br /> <br />A note on the opposition to this book. I checked out the \\"frankenlies\\" website. Of the first half dozen or so \\"lies\\" identified, one (Helen Thomas) was actually a joke which they missed, another (Clinton capturing Ramzi Yousef) is supported the the US security services who say their international activites enabled the Phillipines police to catch Yousef - almost all the claims of 'Frankenlies' crumble when scrutinised. <br /> <br />A book for Americans to buy and use to enable a sceptical reading of Right propaganda, particularly during the present election, and for the rest of us to buy and read with amusement but considerable horror.	2004-09-05

He picks them apart like Jeffery Dahmer on a Thanksgiving turkey, going into their backrounds to show where the lying began. <br /> <br />His targets come from the world of pundits, former and current news show stars, and political authors all of whom seem to have their heads firmly placed in their posteriors.

This is the kind of book that makes hash out of the self aggrandizing clods that Franken so obviously relishes lampooning. \\"Lies...\\" is at it's best when Al and \\"Team Franken\\" research blatant indiscretions and calls the baddies (Fox News, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" etc) to the carpet for playing off such obvious distortions. When the book stays on that course, it's nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />On the other hand, I guess there's that little leftover smug humor streak from \\"Saturday Night Live\\" that forces you to sit through such wretchedly unfunny chapters like \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" or \\"Operation Chicken Hawk,\\" where Franken envisions George Bush as a trigger happy coward and Rush Limbaugh as a loose boweled wuss. It distracts from the core argument that these men trash Kerry's war service without having as much as stood in combat situations by tipping to the deeply offensive (much like Coulter's hideous column about the \\"Women of the Democratic Convention,\\" which got her kicked off the coverage bench by USA Today).<br /><br />Even with a couple of mis-fires, Franken is at his best here. For instance, Chapter 17, \\"Our National Dialogue on Terrorism\\" is barely a page long but cuts to the core as well as any other chapter in the book. Had the satirical bits in \\"Lies...\\" held that tone, this would be a five star rating. And just as I call this a 4 star book, this is an important read. Knowing that there are people in the current regime who gleefully plot the undermining of genuine hardworking Government officials like Max Cleland or knowingly savage the reputations of the late Paul Wellstone and his colleagues for personal gain deserve to be ridiculed in the manner that Franken unleashes on them here. Most important, the fact checking is something that makes you wonder why our major networks can't uncover even the simple lies that spew forth nightly, when Franken and a bunch of college kids could.<br /><br />There are other things to be noted here, like Franken's fun trip to Bob Jones University, the personal emotion vested in the chapters concerning the late Paul Wellstone, and the short but slicing chapter about Barbara Bush. \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" may not always be on the right track, but it has two things over almost every other book on the current Political shelf. \\"Lies..\\" gets its facts straight and its heart is in the right place.s fun trip to Bob Jones University, the personal emotion vested in the chapters concerning the late Paul Wellstone, and the short but slicing chapter about Barbara Bush. \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\" may not always be on the right track, but it has two things over almost every other book on the current Political shelf. \\"Lies..\\" gets its facts straight and its heart is in the right place.	2004-09-01

Al Franken, a respected satirist, exposes the Bush Administration's policies and their right-wing media hacks in his book, \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.\\" Franken examines the Bush Administration's policies of squandering our surplus, ravaging the environment, alienating the rest of the world and giving the largest tax cuts to the top end of the economic ladder.<br /><br />Franken says the right-wing media such as Fox News, The Washington Times, the New York Post, the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal and Talk Radio perpetuate left -wing bias myths and are not interested in the truth. Their agenda is to silence the Bush critics, concoct inflammatory stories, then repeat and embellish them to serve their political goal.<br /><br />Rupert Murdock a billionaire who created a right-wing empire owns Fox News Channel the number one most watched news channel on television. Forbes Magazine ranked him the fourth most powerful man in the world as he owns the largest group of television stations in the U. S. and 130 English speaking newspapers including the London Times and the New York Post. He also owns 20th C Fox, Harper-Collins Publishing, The TV Guide and the Los Angles Dodges. The August Columbia Review wrote in 2002 that Murdock \\"wields his media as an instrument of influence with politics.\\"<br /><br />Another sneaky technique used by the right to spreads lies about an opponent in \\"Push Polling.\\" Lee Atwater, Bush Sr.'s political guru, invented Push Polling. Senator John McCaine may have been defeated through the use of Push Polling in 2000 when unsuspecting voters called and asked if they would vote for him if they knew that he was a cheat and a liar and a fraud, and that he fathered a illegitimate black child. The truth is that Mcain is an honorable man and he and his wife adopted Bridgett, a dark skinned girl from Bangladeshi.<br /><br />Another influential American conservative talk radio commentator is Rush Limbaugh. He entertains a major national audience-over 20 million people a week, whose frustration and anger he mines to share his bigoted and biased positions.<br /><br />Limbaugh is such a joke among the \\"liberals\\" that Franken wrote another amusing satire titled \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" about American politics and the conservative right including Bush.<br /><br />Limbaugh is in his mid 50s and is a known racist, sexist and hypocrite. He preaches \\"family values\\" although he was married three times, he is big on wars although he avoided the draft and preaches against government handouts although he collected unemployment. He scoffed at drug addicts before going in for detoxification three times for a drug addiction to painkillers. He is being investigated for being a part of an illegal drug ring in Florida. Limbaugh failed to register to vote until he was thirty-five and until recently he was so overweight he needed two airline coach seats.<br /><br />Limbaugh champions unmitigated business development and dismisses efforts to protect the earth. He ridicules and takes outrageous umbrage at imagined groups: environmentalists, drug addicts, liberals, African Americans, American Indians, feminists, the media, people on welfare...the list goes on. He is also known to misstate facts with alarming frequency like claiming that Styrofoam is biodegradable and paper is not. He believes that the planet does not have pollution problems (there is no damage to the ozone layer or global warming or deforestation or overpopulation) and thinks it is a liberal conspiracy to end free enterprise. He wrote in his book, \\"See, I told You So\\" \\"There are more acres of forest land in America today than when Columbus discovered the continent in 1492.\\" Limbaugh was recently asked to resign as an ESPN sports analyst because of his inappropriate racial slurs.<br /><br />Both of Franken's books are filled with provocative and timely information. Also unlike the rhetoric on the right he is interested the truth and his facts are accurate.s facts are accurate. <br />	2004-08-30

Al Franken, the goof of SNL gets serious about stuff he used to joke about. Why isn't he joking about the biggest goof of all, Bill (goofy) Klintoon? Surely if Leno and Letterman and all the other successful late nighters can get a hoot out of the man, Al could at least quit the sychophant prattle towards the \\"previous\\" administration and talk about politics as a whole. Perhaps a 3 or 4 party system, maybe some constructive dialog towards real change and not perceptions based on \\"facts\\" that even the mighty Al Franken or Michael Moore are not privy to.<br /><br />My advice, read it! Accept it as fact and then go up to scholarly web sites and pull down both inferential and discriptive statistics on issues such as... the economy (for example). That would allow the reader a feel for what the term \\"intuitive\\" deduction means and how value added (wink wink) intuitive reasoning (such as this book) really is.<br /><br />It is an amusing read and Al Franken will always be, in my minds eye, an amusing fellow. Gosh, all the press and hullaballo couldn't have hurt either. Nothing like a media hype to boost the 'ol career, and probably at a time when (Al who?) needed one. After all his audience has shifted and the demongraphics for his talent has moved on to other venues.	2004-08-29

Those  with the greatest need to read it will probably never open it, yet some may condemn all favorable reviews!<br /><br />  Franken has put together an energetic, highly motivated, extremely bright group of researchers (whom he lists and describes at the end of the book) to back up his assertions and to expose the shoddy, shallow name-callers of the right, people of the ilk of Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter.<br /><br />Franken refers to his approach as \\"kidding on the square\\", making his points and telling the truth with great hilarity and a wit which the people mentioned above, can only rail against but can never equal.  What an accomplishment---a laugh-out-loud on every page, some sly digs administered with such subtle humor that some of it doubtless goes right over the heads of many of his targets, and  some absolutely-verifiable facts along with irrefutably-accurate charts.  Even the charts bubble over with Franken's  pointed wit.  My favorite is the one showing the number of military horses purchased by Abraham Lincoln with those purchased by Ronald Reagan.  (His point?  Different time, different situation: Unfair to compare Reagan's military \\"cold war\\" expenditures with those of Bill Clinton's after the Soviet Union was disbanded.)<br /><br />Franken's book is written in a friendly, often modest, \\"Minnesota-nice\\" tone which will stingingly enrage his right-wing critics even more.

Republicans will rage over that statement mainly because they know theyve got no argument.  Biggest surplus to the worst deficit.  Completely dismantling clintons environmental laws, which should be one of the most important subjects on the table, considering there are hormone disrupting chemicals contaminating our bodies and undermining our fertility as we speak.  I recommend reading \\"Our Stolen Future\\" by Theo Colburn. Scary and FACTUAL! <br />Bush is a liar, and o reilly, and fox news, which blows anyway-talk about bias!

In there attempt to rebuke Ann Coulter they only site one error from her latest book and call her a B**CH.  Had they been taught research skills, they would have dug-up enough information to burry Ann. Instead they chose to throw a few ad-hominems at her.    The book is not a hard read. At least it is not meant to be. However, one easily finds oneself rereading certain lines in an attempt to get the punch line of a joke.  There were too many that were almost funny, but not quite. Al, at least on paper, is loosing his comedic touch.    Overall, if you are a liberal who hates Bush and Coulter, you are bound to at least like this title.

I listened to this book on audio. It's definitely the way to go. Franken's words spoken by himself are priceless. His attacks on rad-con pundits are mainly accurate. Some angry fans of those pundits will bash the book but they'll do this without reading it. Once you see past the humor, convictions and bias, Franken raises some well covered points like a detailed explanation of the tax cut and a no holds barred scolding of environmental policies. <br /> <br />The book drags toward the middle. The Jesus secion as a little odd but overall the book is a humorous read and a surprisingly: a generally factual one. Unlike Hannity's \\"deliver us from evil\\" (which I have read), Franken does not talk from the confines of a radically selective reality. He does not cater to simple-minded ideals to make an argument but rather points out real lies and distortions by the right wing. His occasional inaccuracies or stretched-truths both in and out of the book are understandable in a passionate argument but do not at all discredit his facts and are dwarfed by a strong message which only the most stubborn Hannity-like conservative can scoff at. <br />	2004-08-21

I really wasn't impressed with the book very much. Frankens attempts at humor fell flat (I did laugh one time while reading this book - hence the addition of a star). <br /> <br />While Franken does make some interesting points about Republican spin (lies?) on certain matters (Wellstones memorial is a prime example) most of his examples are themselves based on fallacy and downright lying. <br /> <br />Several examples of his lies come to mind.  <br /> <br /> - Bill O'Reilly is not from Levittown - he is from Westbury FALSE!. Bill has released the deed to the house that he grew up in in, guess what? It's in Levittown.  <br /> <br /> - Ann Coulter stating that Evan Thomas's father was Norman Thomas. OK, he caught her, of course Norman Thomas is Evan Thomas' grandfather. A point which was corrected in the paperback edition of Slander (Franken also acknowledges that Norman is the grandfather of Evan Jr. in the end notes of Lying Liars) <br /> <br /> - President Clinton thwarted a plot to highjack 12 American airplanes and to kill the Pope. False - This was accomplished by Phillipine officials. The gentlemen involved were caught after they lit their apartment on fire while trying to mix explosives. <br /> <br /> - There was no record of damage that may have been caused by the outgoing Clinton administration to the White House - False. A quick review of the GAO report released in June of 02 puts this to rest rather quickly. <br /> <br />I find it amusing that somebody who purports to \\"do something my targets seem incapable of doing, getting my facts straight\\" and \\"Telling the truth is something I try to take seriously, and I try to hold myself to a high standard\\" would get so many facts wrong and intentionally decieve readers of his book. <br /> <br />I'm sure that there are many books that push a logical, coherent and fact based arguement against the right, but this book is not it.	2004-08-19

Franken is an entertainer of course, but he writes little that is not based on readily verifiable sources.  In some cases, he does a nice outline of individual pieces of right-media criticism that us working-family folks do not have time to compile.  For me, the book was tremendously energizing.  Living through the Clinton years gave me a great distaste for any form of mass news media.  Now I feel asleep at the switch, barn closed, cows gone, whatever.  I've been missing too many stories.  The central revelation in the book, for me, was that the Bush administration has essentially no policy-making infrastructure instead deriving all ideas from the political machinery.  This gives me a starkly different view on what another four years of President Bush would be like--and rather less relative concern about the alternative, Kerry. <br /> <br />In addition, Franken delivers the most powerful defense I have seen of the Clinton administration's antiterrorism record, noting prominently the resistance Clinton got from a Republican Congress determined to obstruct anything the Democrat president wanted to do.  Based not on Franken but buttressed by his summary, I am forced to conclude that having the administration change parties in 2001, with an extremely sloppy handoff of the antiterrorism agenda from an \\"obsessed\\" Clinton White House to an asleep Bush administration, was a major contributor to the 9/11 plot going off without a hitch.  Do you think a Gore administration would have ignored all those early warning signs in 2001?  Clinton had been bracing for such. <br /> <br />I used to believe that Clinton's use of the military in foreign policy was abusive, that our armed forces were not designed and never prepared mentally to be attempting police actions and political interventions in Somalia and Bosnia.  Typical Democrat inability to understand the military.  Franken makes a good case that Clinton's moves made more sense than Bush invading Iraq again did.  And Iraq has all the feel of a disaster much bigger than Somalia. <br /> <br />\\"Lies\\" tries to be an entertaining book but cannot help verging on being an important book.  It's the closest we can get to powerful political criticism these days, what with the Washington media emasculated by Rove and Fleischer.  Makes me wonder how many years it will be before conservative voters will realize how badly they have been hoodwinked.  Franken does a chuckle-inducing job of laying out the conservative-media (and GOP campaign) strategy of demonizing the opposition regardless of truth.  But if conservative voters have so bought into this that they can't tolerate even discussion of other views, change will be very slow.	2004-08-09

It is an amazing book, and -- if you're a decent, honest, hardworking, patriotic, true-blue conservative who listens to Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly and watches Fox News -- an earth-shattering book...Every decent, honest, hardworking, true-blue conservative owes it to himself to read it.&quot; (The Oregonian). If every decent, honest, hardworking, true-blue conservative reader had the integrity of the Oregonian reviewer, and were able to approach Franken's book with an open mind, the world might just become a better place. Why? Because this thoroughly researched book tears apart the dishonesty of right-wing media pundits so impeccably that only a seriously deluded person could continue to support and admire the distortion and suppression of truth that characterizes the work of these pundits. We might then return to old-fashioned, real discourse and debate based upon mutual respect instead of plain, old LYING. <br />  <br /> LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM is at times a painful book to read, because the unfairness and long-term negative repercussions of right-wing media lying (for instance, how it slandered, distorted and mangled Al Gore's Presidential campaign) produced a lot of rage in me. I had to put the book down numerous times in order to decompress. Yes, it's also a laugh-out-loud funny book, and sometimes downright crude. But considering the outrageous and pervasive lies that Franken confronts, I don't fault him for needing to let off some steam. <br />  <br /> If you are unfamiliar with Franken's work and want to get a taste before you buy or read the book, and don't yet have access to his radio station, Air America Radio, in your home town, it is streamed for all to hear via the Internet. Listen if you can, but in any case, read the book and educate yourself. There is a tremendous amount of important information dealing with recent U.S. history (the Weapons of Mass Destruction issue, for instance) and President Bush's policies (with respect to education and taxes, for example). If you're undecided, you won't be when you finish reading, and I promise you it won't be because you were bamboozled. Franken has a quirky, eccentric love affair with the truth going on, and once you get the hang of it, you too will be hooked.	2004-08-05

I'll give you moment so as to catch up before I begin.... <br /> I am of the mind that a reader about to dive into as vacuous a piece of fiction as the one written by Mr. Franken should only take the author's work as seriously as the author takes himself. Mr. Franken, much like a vast number of the histrionic prone left, believes himself a seer of the prevailing political views of Middle America. What this satirical and incoherent work seems to miss,however, is that a majority of Americans embrace many of the &quot;simple&quot; values that find denigration on the pages of Mr. Franken's book. I understand that self-loathing persons like Mr. Franken retain a sense of assuredness in their ability to engage in rampant self-deprication and aggrandizement. What I fail to understand are the reasons Mr. Franken is so consistently offended at the attempts of his antagonists to point out that he and his allies are nothing akin to the dissenters and patriots who have opposed our Government in previous times of peril.. At the very least, the opponents of prevailing wisdom in other modern fist-a-cuffs embraced the notion that America was still a good and just nation. Mr. Franken, along with Moore, Krugman,Soros and Chomsky find themselves speaking to the fringe of American Politics for their inability to embrace the inherent goodness of a nation who has, without reticence, stood for freedom and liberty to generations of people across the vast expanses of our planet....

If you're a liberal, you'll laugh your tail off (if the vulgarity isn't too offensive for you). If you're a conservative then it will be more difficult but if you can remove yourself from the political arena and read it as comedy you might be able to laugh a bit, but I doubt it.<br /><br /> Problem...it needs to be taken for what it is. Satire. I am a bit frightened that people are reading this as a serious democrat's statement. I am HOPING that is not Franken's intention. He is a comedian....and he's writing one funny book...and he's making fun of people he really doesn't like. However, he is also stepping into the ring with the right's Limbaugh and Coulter who spout nothing but crap about the left. If he is seriously pulling us into that pissing contest then I will be more than a little disappointed.<br /><br /> Do not look to this book to reveal any &quot;truths&quot; to you. Find the truth through more credible sources. Find the humor with Franken.<br /><br /> I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to be accused of giving it 5 stars (for the humor) because I'm a liberal and I didn't want to give it 1 star (as a political work).	2004-07-29

Franken takes on the conservative right again, in much the same manner as in his previous book, Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot. He quotes the right's own words back to them, and points out where they got it (whatever &quot;it&quot; may have been at the moment) wrong, plus where they manipulated, distorted or outright lied about the facts. He cites his sources, he names names, he points fingers, and he doesn't cut anyone any slack.

I don't know if US political culture is just very right wing or European culture very left wing, but the whole political scene is different.   <br /> <br />We certainly don't have the type of radio, tv commentators as Rush or Anne - politics isn't dealt with in quite as an aggressive way apart from in the print media.

For someone who is so &quot;loved&quot; in his circuit, I was appalled by his book.

Franken writes with his emotion rather than his intellect. It's unfortunate that people will believe his &quot;lies&quot; and be decieved simply because they are looking for the truth. And how about that hypocritical title - A fair and balanced look MY EYE! Don't waste your money... <br />  <br /> It seems to me that the author is so concerned about getting his EMOTION across that he forgets that America is who it is because we stand behind eachother and don't try to tear down our fortress from the inside.

I reject ad hominem commentary and obscene language.<br />Yet Franken gets away with both and is very funny to boot.<br />He says things about Ann Coulter that I suspect many of us have been thinking since first seeing her on TV, but haven't wanted to say, out of courtesy's sake. Franken says these things in a way that is so funny you are laughing too hard to monitor your laughter to make sure it is polite.<br />In his own defense, he points out that his targets, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, etc, have made ad hominem commentary their stock in trade. Franken reports on Limbaugh referring to the teenage Chelsea Clinton as the &quot;White House dog,&quot; for example, and Ann Coulter naming a list of ugly Democratic women. After Franken exposes the venom, the distortions, and the mean-spirited sneakiness of his opponents, you see the logic behind his own exasperated and yet precise attacks.<br />Too, Franken points out the simple, basic lies that these same folks have promulgated as facts. And he has had the courage to confront his opponents in person.<br />&quot;Facts are stubborn things,&quot; as John Adams said. Franken has done considerable research to use facts to expose his opponents as basing their positions on sand.<br />And yet, for all its genuine erudition, its core of compassionate and patriotic outrage -- this is a very, very funny book. This is the kind of book that is dangerous to read in a public place. You can't help but laugh out loud and draw attention to yourself.<br />This book aroused in me a great admiration for Al Franken, and a feeling that if liberals want to regain power in America, they might do well to learn from his humor, his armory of facts, and his considerable courage.power in America, they might do well to learn from his humor, his armory of facts, and his considerable courage.	2004-07-17

It was about the Fox News Channel, which is a fair, balanced news organization that roots for America. The Left says they are conservative. They are not. They just look that way compared to the liberal CNN, CBS, and most of the other network and cable stations (except for MSNBC). Fair and truthful analysts have concluded that Fox is the most believable and trusted news organization. Fair and truthful analysts concluded that Franken's book was, like Michael Moore's books and documentaries, filled with lies and half-truths. Franken was fed information by the Democrat-leaning Kennedy School of Government, and funded by George Soros, a socialist billionaire, who started Air America. Air America failed immediately. Conservative talk radio succeeds where liberal talk radio fails because conservatives, like Christians, are starving for Truth and decency in a world of anti-Americanism, religious intolerance and negativism. Conservatives are more likely to be educated people who prefer to improve themselves by learning about the world by listening to talk radio. Liberals are more likely to be old '60s rockers who prefer to listen to Santana and The Grateful Dead on FM. Res ipsa loquiter. <br />Throughout the Cold War, does anybody really doubt that, all else being equal, the Communists &quot;voted&quot; for Democrats over Republicans? Is their any doubt that terrorists prefer Democrats to Republicans? Is commentary really necessary? Res ipsa loquiter.<br />Hollywood and the rock'n'roll world is solidly Democrat. This is a world of drug abuse, alcoholism, adultery, divorce, homosexuality, atheism and immorality. The country 'n' western community is overwhelmingly Republican. This is a world of religion, family values, patriotism, respect for the military and overall morality. Res ipsa loquiter.<br />Time has forced many historical facts to recede in our collective memory, replaced by afuzzy kind of Leftist thinking that has even romanticized Communism among our youth, who do not always know the complete facts. How else to explain the popularity of Che Guevara t-shirts and posters? Some celebrities - Chevy Chase, Oliver Stone, Steven Spelberg, to name just a few -  have gone so far as to travel to Cuba and meet with  Castro, returning with glowing reports about the Cuban dictator's &quot;charisma&quot; or some such malarkey.  <br />Based on the undeniable Truths of empirical evidence, one is left to determine the simple fact that those aligned with the right are more likely to be good and decent people, while people aligned with the Left less likely to be. To deny this is to be a sophist and rely on various and sundry lies, identifiable by those who can read, write, see and have access to facts. Franken is another of these leaches who eat away at traditinal goodness, using the youth's ignorance as his weapon.<br />Forgive me my tresspasses as I forgive them theirs. <br />STEVEN TRAVERS<br />AUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;<BR>STRAVERSCA@AOL.COM	2004-07-15

Reading the book was worthwhile just to find this quote, which sums up how I feel:<br />&quot;You see, they (Conservatives) love America the way a four-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a four-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow.&quot;<br />Yep, that's pretty much it, isn't it?	2004-07-12

By most liberal standards I'm fairly conservative (and have been since waaaay before that PR*CK Bush made it an insult.)  But when I was bed ridden for weeks with a severe tear in my hamstring I became a little desperate for things to read.  When a more liberal friend brought RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT in for me to read, I was, well, hesitant.<br />I read the entire thing in about 5 hours. . . Then I read it again, laughing my *ss off!!  My wife read it, and we then we began buying copies for our friends.  We gave copies out for Christmas and birthdays.<br />The short of it?  This book is genius.  It's pure unadulterated genius, and I love it. . . ALMOST as much as RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT.  When it hits softcover, you can bet we'll be buying it by the case, as well.<br />Franken is smart, outspoken, funny, and worst of all, correct.  My party has fallen into a shameful pit of greed.  Being Republican used to mean that you were for bolstering the economy for ALL Americans.  It used to mean keeping an eye on the government so things like the &quot;patriot&quot; act (patriotic in title, ONLY) would never come to pass.  It used to mean that you were going to retire rich because you'd worked harder than others.<br />Please, oh please, young readers, do not judge all Republicans by the slanderous slimebag that oozes about the Oval Office these days; we do actually have a purpose. . . We've just forgotten what it is.<br />Come back Bill, all is forgiven.	2004-07-11

It is largely an anecdotal collection of amusing stories and bitter tyrades. Franken makes no excuses for the fact that he's basically a comedian, and his skill at tickling the funny bone shines through every chapter here; it's a very entertaining read. How seriously you can take it however is questionable. Franken devalues the significance of his more pointed questions and assertions here through his level of attack. There is certainly plenty here that warrants attention but it is best left to those more articulate and boring to speak in a way the right wing is more likely to accomodate. For a more serious read, pick up Ivins, Chomsky, even Moore. For a light-hearted romp through one of the most despised people on the left showing you why he is hated so much, and making you laugh along the way, this should do you. Those of you on the right won't have to try hard to find things to critizise here (always a easier choice then tackling some of the real questions and points which you'll also find here); those of us on the left will just enjoy the tales and the humor.	2004-07-10

It's clear Franken has a political jones that won't go away.<br />Regardless of your political stripe, you've got to give Franken credit for the work that went into this book: marshalling a team of 14 over a two-year period, this is no hack, slap-and-paste effort.

Franken had some kind of research situation at Harvard, where he could make use of a team of graduate students to ferret out facts that refute the intentional misrepresentation of both liberal and conservative political statements and events by the right-wing media (E.g., Fox News, Sean Hannity, etc.) The result is surprisingly well-documented, although using mostly secondary sources, so there is a serious point being made.  But Franken's angry, vitriolic sarcasm reveals he has no distance on his topic- it is personal for him.  That detracts from the serious message of the book. In the end, I don't really know if Fox news is any more or less balanced than ABC news.  But his diction and timing are so perfect, it just makes you erupt in involuntary laughter.

A significant fraction have torn it to pieces over minor details.. reading all the vicious, jabbering motormouths who've here is very strange.    Somehow there has to be a way to get beyond the he-said she-said sniping and mud-slinging and evaluate this book based on objective facts.  I have no use for people who hate this book because there are typos in chapter 7, or more often, just 'it's full of lies' - all unspecified lies.      My sense is that Franken's detractors are mostly Limbaugh lemmings who will do no data or policy analysis on anything they might disagree with.      Now I believe that many subjects, like the war in Iraq, have not played themselves out yet..  There is no fixed data & it's too early to tell what the final story is..  Maybe Iraq's democracy will take root.  It's possible.   But the Bush administration's record and their legislative priorities & methods are as plain as day.  The people who are gunning for Franken should defend Bush's record & stop pursuing the side-characters.  They won't convince anyone of anything through these self-back-patting excersizes on Amazon.    For example, if Al says there are giant lakes of pig sh*t in West Virginia, someone should say why Bush supports this as good policy.  Insulting Al & calling him a liberal says much more about the writer than about the book.      To be honest, I don't think the dittoheads here have read the book.  I don't think they could logically debate the positions of the book - the substance, not the nitpicking details.      I think the right wing has become a cult-like institution.  That's not hyperbole. really.. It's a cult of personality around Bush & Limbaugh & friends.  If Cheney said that the earth was flat, millions of people out there would say..maybe he's right. (!)    I think they'll be defeated in the election.  That will be wonderful, because these lemmings are insufferable.  I'm looking forward to watching them eat crow in November, and then hopefully they will once again become independent and logical thinkers.  It's better for them & better for us all.

He takes the smallest errors that a conservative figure might have said or made and tries to make it a huge significant issue. Frankly, it's boring. He goes on and on about the most remote matters and you quickly come to the conclusion that he's just another hardcore left-wing lunatic grasping at straws in the most desperate manner. And just like the left-wing, he focuses on the minor issues while ignoring the major deficiences of those on the Left.

And his attempt at wit is as successful as his movie flop, &quot;Stuart saves his family&quot;.<br />After reading this tripe, I was considering throwing the book in the garbage but he's so insulting and so full of himself and so full of lies, that I got the receipt for the book and I returned it for a refund. That was the best part of the book; getting a refund.<br />I mean, if there were some value to this book like how the liberal mind works and the arguments they put forth, then it might be worth keeping. But this book is so irratic and indiscriminate, that you think that there's no way a person really believes this nonsense.<br />My advice: If you see this book in the bargain bin in a book store, walk away, you'll be glad you did.	2004-07-04

The majority of people who read this book will miss the real message involved in the book and completly ignore the fact that it is a satire. Al Fanken attacks the right for a majority of reasons that have no meaning and are stupid, like Ann Coulter calling someone a son and not grandson. While at the same time defend Gore for inventing the internet. The most moving chapter in the book is the one about Paul Wellstone denouncing smear campaigns and the evil involved with them. But the book is a smear campaign, hence the irony. The overwhelming message is not that the right is a lying machine, but that politics should not be about berating and lying about your contenders but about the people you represent.

Just try to be interesting for God's sake. Pages and pages on Ann Coulter (whoever that is) and Hannity (from some stupid TV show, I guess) is not interesting. The low point of this book is when he goes on and on taking apart some obscure editorial about gun control. So the editorial is garbage. Who cares? I can only imagine how bad his book devoted entirely to debunking Rush Limbaugh is. Basically, what you have here is a boring book that butts heads with other bores in a big bore-fest. I will give Franken this much, however: He is a better writer than Limbaugh. Franken at least has a little bit of interesting material when he gets off his 'conservatives are liars' soapbox and discusses some real issues. The book has three interesting parts. 1)The comparison between Clinton's and Bush's (pre-9-11) fight against terrorism. 2) The stuff on Rupert Murdoch  (which everyone already knows but is still amazing) 3) The chapter on pig feces. <BR> <BR>The whole Republican vs. Democrats thing is for simpletons.	2004-06-29

Al Franken takes the unpleasantness of politics and makes it entertaining. Along the way he illustrates the tactics of several popular right-wing hacks and delves into the legitimacy of their claims.

The majority of his points and topics are well thought out, well reasoned and will change the way you view talk radio, Fox News and the supposedly-liberal media.

Skits like Operation Chickenhawk and Supply Side Jesus make their points while making you laugh, and repeating themes like the Bush administration's pre-9/11 terrorism plan, Operation Ignore, bring a necessary levity to a very serious topic.<br />If you only read one piece of non-fiction this year, make it this book.

The book was funny, as I expected from an SNL alum.  As I read, I started to realize what attrocities people like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity were committing.

The USA PATRIOT ACT, &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot;, Tax cuts, the Death Tax, and many other policies are looked at with a fine-toothed comb.  Also, Al was able to make a highly convincing argument that proves that our President ignored the terrorist organizations and allowed 9/11 to happen.

I first read Coulter's book &quot;Slander&quot; and expected it to be a pure rebuttle to her book, but it was not!  Sure, Franken uses her as a punching bag, but he points out that she set herself up for it.  This book is not so serious, and should be read as a light and humorous view of the liberal side.  His use of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard for the reader to tell the truth from an exaggeration or satirical remark.  It bothered me at first, but after a few pages I realized how much it adds to the book.  Unlike Coulter's dry (allegedly) fact-filled book, Franken presents his facts in an easily absorbable manner.  This was a quick, fun read that raised issues and allowed me to think for myself--not propogandistic material against the other side (Coulter).	2004-06-12

This book was especially good for me in particular because I don't have cable and I don't listen to right wing shock radio or read crapmatter like National Review, Wall Street Journal op-eds, etc., so I'm not really up on infotainment affairs. This being the case, I was brought up to speed on the infotainment pop culture zeitgeist, and unfortunately it's even more appalling than I thought. Franken's documented fact checking and subsequent confrontation with liars is awesome. The humor aspect is cool I guess, but go down one thin layer and it's easy to see a patriotic American who is in a lot of pain over all the swine who have commandeered the media and all the sheeple who eat this stuff for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

But then again, just how hard is it to find inaccuracies, half-truths, lies and worse in the rantings of zealots like Coulter and Co.? Unfortunately, Franken misses the larger issue, which is that public discourse in America is increasingly dominated by zealots of right and left, and Ivins, Moore, Hightower and their ilk play just as loose with facts and are just as ideologically driven as their right wing counterparts. So unfortunately Franken misses a nice trick by focusing on the blatant stupidity of his political and cultural enemies, and ends up merely preaching to the choir instead of capitalizing on the opportunity to examine a problem of real urgency, which is the increasingly fundamentalist character of America, or rather, of two competing Americas.	2004-06-09

All of that does not matter as long as you subscribe to their left wing pink communist beliefs. It has been said on so many occasions, Liberalism is a mental decease. One that must be fought from all angles so that our stars and bars do not get replace by an axe and sickle.	2004-06-08

I love listening to him just to hear what will come out of his mouth next. When he's making political jokes and parodies is when he's at his best. When he makes serious biased political remarks, sometimes my lips kind of cringe a bit. Many of his &quot;facts&quot; are not the objective two-sided facts that he would like them to be. I guess the same problem I have with this book's liberal bias is the same problem I have with, say, the conservative bias of &quot;Deliver Us From Evil&quot;. But regardless, this is a very entertaining read, and it makes many good points about the mistakes of the Bush Administration, and when he does it with a straight face, his satirical wit and humor are matchless! This book is only half the truth, but you should read it to understand this perspective. Al Franken won't tell you that LIEberals lie just as much, if not more, than Conservatives, because he wants you to believe his beliefs and he wants to get his book on your bookshelf like any other author. I don't applaud his partisan spin and misinformation of facts, but I do highly applaud his other good points about this Administration's dismal economic record, lack of environmental initiative, and responsibility for causing rampant anti-Americanism world-wide.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;	2004-06-08

An even more cumbersome title, but perhaps a better description of the book.  Just kidding!  \\"Kidding on the square,\\" that is.  Seriously, I don't think Al Franken is a liar.  He means well.  But this is no \\"fair and balanced look at the right.\\" Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile, entertaining, sometimes even informative read.  <br />Franken reasons that the profit motive drives the mainstream media rather than any real or perceived liberal or conservative bias, and this affects how we get our news.  Bear this in mind the next time you feel your favorite politician is either getting shafted by the media or receiving a free pass.  They all take their lumps (yes Al, even George W. Bush.)          <BR> <BR>Franken does a number on the usual cast of conservative windbags (Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, etc).  Fair enough.  But if you take their words (or Al Franken's, for that matter) at face value, then you're a dupe anyway.  <br />Franken's humor saves this book from simply being a mean-sprited attack on the right.  Barely.

America is the best country in the world because the people with the lowest intelligence and ability (liberals) are not rewarded for the work of others.  Liberals are simply unable to answer the following questions that destroy their intellectually bankrupt arguments that buckle under the slightest scrutiny.<br />He exemplifies why Liberals believe the following seven lies :<br />1) America is rich only because it has stolen money from other countries. Africa would be rich if America had not stolen from Africa. Even the wealth created in the last 10 years from software development was the result of exploiting the Amazon jungles and the Congo.<BR>2) Blacks in the US deserve reparations, even from people who's ancestors came to the US much later than the Civil War. Even Asian American taxpayers who arrived in the 1970s must pay reparations to Blacks who would otherwise be wealthy in Africa had they not been taken from there. Blacks are continually discriminated against by whites to this day at every possible opportunity. The fact that black immigrants from Dominica and Jamaica are doing much better than African Americans means that they are selectively not subjected to racism, even though their skin is even darker. <BR>3) The SAT is racially biased. The fact that Korean, Chinese, and Indian students do better than whites still means that it is biased against blacks. <BR>4) All rich people are rich because they had rich parents. If someone has poor parents, they have no chance. Communism, which fairly redistributes the fixed amount of dollars in the US, is the only fair solution. Even the immigrants who became rich after coming here (Andy Grove, George Soros, Vinod Khosla, Arnold Schwarznegger, etc.) have exploited others. <BR>5) Bush's tax cut only favors the rich. The person making $300,000 was paying $100,000 in taxes, and now will only pay $80,000, getting a refund of $20,000! The person making only $20,000 was paying $2000 in taxes, and now will still pay $1500, getting a refund of only $500. It is unfair that the rich person gets a refund that is 40 times larger than the poor person! They should get a refund of the same size! The fact that the rich person is STILL paying $80,000 while the poor person is only paying $1500, or less than 2% as much, is irrelevent. The rich are evil, and we have to take it away. <BR>6) We have NO right to attack the Taliban, even though they don't allow girls to go to school and force women to wear a burkha. Women in the US, however, are still held back by the glass ceiling.<BR>7) All the world's cultures are equal. The fact that immigrants from every part of the globe want to leave their countries and come to the US is not a valid point. I do not need to visit Africa, China, Brazil, or Iraq to know that their cultures are better than America. It is okay for China to massacre its own students at Tianamen, and conduct genocide against Tibetans and Uighurs, but it is wrong for the US to attack the Taliban while providing food for the Afghan people. <br />If you are a conservative who is angered by liberals who put forth these arguments, you will the vacuum of liberal thought in this book. You will also know when you have WON when liberals say 'you are dumb' or 'you don't know' without putting forth an intelligent sentence. <br />If you are a liberal who thinks this book is true, get out into the real world and gain some common sense for a change (liberals usually only believe in free speech when it consists of their own liberal intellectual incest.). <br />Note that the fools giving this book five stars do not actually point out any flaws in conservative reasoning, but just scream about things not relevant to common sense. That is because CONSERVATIVES HAVE ALREADY ANALYZED AND DEFEATED THEIR POINTS, and they have no choice but to cry in protest to their being outwitted and embarrassed. It is easy to win a debate against some liberal pseudo-intellectual. <br />Liberals are so dumb that their fanatical beliefs have actually become their religion. They are religious fanatics to just as great a degree as a Crackpot Christian. <br />Liberals are also incredibly racist - they hate educated minorities only because they are dark-skinned people who do not subscribe to their fanatical religion of liberalism	2004-06-04

Franken isn't exactly halarious, but &quot;Lies&quot; does a great job of describing the Right's constant hypocrasy (IE: They say Presidents don't directly control the economy, but according to the right Bill Clinton's success with the economy was due to &quot;Reaganomics&quot;). I was expecting more humor but it's mainly a good source of information. Franken tackles conservative diva du jour Anne Coulter, radio favorites Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, FOX News, Bernie Goldberg (ironically CBS is my favorite news), The Wall Street Journal, Washington Times and other right-wing outlets. Thankfully the left is just starting to grow and is no longer the &quot;underdog&quot; party. I dont exactly agree with Franken's (or Michael Moore's)stance on the war and other areas but I agree with him on most things, which makes &quot;Lies&quot; enjoyable.  Most likely if you're a Democrat or Independent you'll like &quot;Lies&quot;  Is this book partisian? Of course...but what commentator isn't? (Some claim to be: IE FOX's Bill O'Reilly but COME ON we all know the truth here) &quot;Lies&quot; is one of the better liberal books published recently.

I suffered through 300+ pages and found myself asking, &quot;And?&quot;    I can only recommend this book to anyone who wants to know exactly what is wrong with the left today.<br />I won't argue about the discrepancies Al Franken and his all-white &quot;research team&quot; found.  [...] covers that well enough.  I do believe, however, they dredged the river for nothing.  Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter, and are biased?  No kidding.  Really?  Astounding.  This revelation is worthy of a book?  I should change jobs.  <br />The difference is they all admit it and are even proud of it.  I'm biased, too.  So are you.  Neither Rather, Jennings, or Brokaw would admit they were bias if someone were holding a gun to their heads.  The conservative slant these people showcase offsets the liberal slant you hear on ABC, NBC, and CBS everyday.        <br />Someone in the Bush administration gets confused and refers to &quot;rows and rows of crosses&quot; when the headstones at Arlington Cemetery are actually rectangular and Franken thinks he has uncovered a foundation-rocking scandal.  You woke me up for that?  Sorry, Al.  I'm hitting the snooze button.  <br />Besides, on the tops of most of those little rectangular headstones a cross is engraved which readers could've easily seen had Al included a better photo in the book.  But, hey, he had a point to make.  No need to confuse people with the truth.<br />What I read was the same hatred being parrotted by liberals everywhere- &quot;We can certainly do a better job- we just can't say how, exactly.  Oh, and we REALLY hate George W. Bush!&quot;  <br />That attitude has lost them the House, the Presidency, and the Senate.  And they will keep on losing unless they come up with some REAL solutions rather than a long list of people they hate. <br />Personally, I don't think a &quot;misunderestimated&quot; Texan mangling syntax compares with an elitist egomaniac ignoring Al-Qaida for eight years and letting North Korea build nukes while he ordered troops in a military he wouldn't serve in himself to invade a Balkan country that never attacked us and was no imminent threat to us.  I digress...<br />Al Franken and liberals completely miss the whole point.  Say what you will about our leadership- conservatism is winning right now because our faith isn't in the men wearing the suits but in our ideals.  The whole left-wing movement is wrapped in trivial nonsense.  <br />Here's an example of liberalism in a nutshell: <br />While we are trying to fight terrorism, the ACLU is making its own contribution to the effort by getting the cross removed from the seal of the city of Los Angeles.  That should help!  I'm sure we'll all feel safer when they succeed.<br />I'm happy I borrowed this book from a liberal friend rather than contributing to anymore of Al's foolishness.  Another positive result is that it provided some insight into the mind that created that &quot;Stewart Saves His Family&quot; piece of crap.<br />If this is the best Al and his ivy league toadies can do it merely reaffirms my convictions and proves someone wasted a lot of money when they cut that check to Harvard.	2004-06-04

He is able to hang the people he is critical of solely on their own words and methods of double speak and hypocrisy. He looks at nothing more than their research and sources and then exposes the inconsistencies in what they attempt to pass of as truth. This book is an eye-opening glimpse into how right wing media brainwashes its audience.

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It features a 15 year-old crack whore performing fellatio and depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.	2004-05-28

I enjoyed reading it, agreed with some of it, and learned some new information. BUT.......<br />Here is my problem: I have recently been reading a number of these popular one-sided \\"fact-telling\\" books such as Sean Hannitys' \\"Let Freedom Ring\\", Dick Morris' \\"Off with their Heads\\", John Stossel' \\"Give me a Break\\", Bill O'Reilly's \\"No-Spin Zone\\", and a few others. If you read any of these one-note books (Liberal is always right!, or Conservative all the way!!) you will not be reading anything that is even slightly objective yet they all try to take that tone. They all sound reasonable, at least in spots, with plenty of polls and statistics and stories to support their points. But they can't all be correct. <br />When you read several of them at the same time it starts to be overwhelmingly obnoxious. Well, quit shouting at me! If you have a point, lay it out there, but no single perspective is always correct with the other side always wrong. It just doesn't work that way in the real world. So why do they do it? To sell books, or on the TV shows and talk shows, to sell soap or whatever products the ads are promoting. Just remember that and don't allow yourself to get swept up in the muckraking.<br />One funny side effect that happened as I developed a huge skeptical chip on my shoulder toward these self-appointed partisan pundit books from both destructive sides of the political spectrum; I was reading a cookbook (from Cooks Illustrated, a great series) where they were talking about the process they went through to arrive at the best way to cook chicken breasts. I read it, and thought, \\"Yeah, right, that's just a one-sided explanation to prove your point\\". <br />Bottom-line, read Franken or any of these guys purely as entertainment and don't get your decision-making information from them.	2004-05-27

What's much harder is to do real political and media criticism, engage in serious discussion of policy, and be genuinely funny at the same time.  That's what Franken has set out to do, and he largely succeeds.  <br />The first 100 pages or so of this book take aim at O'Reilly, Coulter, Sean Hannity, and other titans of right wing propaganda, nailing their lies and evasions with considerable schadenfreude.  This part is superbly done.  Franken is consistently entertaining and his attacks are dead on target.<br />The remainder is primarily an attack on George Bush, although Franken goes along quite a few detours.  <br />This really isn't a unified book so much as a series of sketches, mostly connected and occasionally coming from way out in left field.  As such, it's definitely hit and miss, although the hits far outnumber the misses.  The chapter on the Paul Wellstone memorial is easily the best in the book; it's both a moving tribute to the man and his friends and an unsparing look at the lies that were spread to use the Wellstone service for Republican propaganda.  The 'Operation Chickenhawk' story is extremely funny, as is the visit to Bob Jones University.  The personal anecdotes of his encounters with O'Reilly, Paul Wolfowitz, Rich Lowry, and others are excellent.  There are some weaker sections, such as the chapter on Franken's search for weapons of mass destruction, a one act play about the Bush tax cuts, and an attack on a stupid editorial on crime by Paul Gigot where Franken uncharacteristically gets his numbers mixed up.  The last 80 pages or so is particularly a grab bag and, except for the Bob Jones story, most of it could have been dropped without great loss.<br />Most of the book is terrific, and the central case, that the propagandists of the current 'conservative' movement, whether in government or media, routinely lie with shocking brazenness and almost no consequences, is thoroughly demonstrated.   This book is a valuable resource for Americans aiming to take back our country from the present cabal.	2004-05-27

Franken gives us a refreshingly funny, and yet still truthful, examination of the right wing media machine. He presents us with several issues (things that make the right look &quot;bad&quot;) that the so-called &quot;liberal dominated&quot; media DO NOT cover. His sometimes scathing commentary of some of the right-wings darlings is spot on; he tears them to shreds by highlighting the unbelievable dishonesty in their &quot;reporting&quot;, and he makes no attempt to hide the level of personal dislike he has for several of them.	2004-05-27

Political satirist Franken obliterates the liars he focuses on.  It is like watching a skilled surgeon cutting out a malignant tumor.  I particularly enjoyed his dismantling of Ann Coulter and her book, Slander, where she tells outright lies that the average knee jerk conservative would never think to question.  Supply side Jesus has got to be my favorite part of the book.<BR>My only criticism is that Franken does not offer as compelling an explanation of the purpose and intent behind the lying.  If you want to go the next step and understand exactly WHY all these liars are selling their souls, read Francione's HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD.  Not quite as entertaining as Franken but it goes much deeper looking behind the lies to the reasons why.  If you loved this book you'll love it even more.	2004-05-27

I found some of the things true and also funny. Al goes after Anne Colture; nutcase. There is a reason she is a nutcase. In her book Slander and Treason, Al explains that in her book that liberials hate America, that liberials are the new terrorist to America. Liberials are against the working man and woman and want to bring big tax cuts to the rich. Then there was his encounter with Bill O'Reilly. Bill got mad because of how he looked like on the cover of his book. Al then goes on to tell the world that Bill lies on his show all the time. One of his lies that when Bill was on Inside Edition, he said that he won two Peadbody Awards; the most greatest award in journalism. Which of course HE DID NOT! So Al called Bill and addressed this to him. He then said that he meant to say that he won a POKE award, not a Peadbody. Al then takes on (and I hate this man) Sean Hannity. Hannity says the same thing that most consertives say; Liberials are communist, liberials are evil, and they hate freedom. I found this to be untrue. For one Liberials don't hate America, we just love America in a different way. Al then goes after Fox News Channel, and how most of the people working for them; Brit Hume, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, and the ONLY Liberial who works on Fox is poor Alan Homes. Of course when a Muslim man calls Bill on his show, when Bill said something about the Koran, which he felt hurt for Bill saying that. He called Bill a 'racist'. Bill then GOT MAD like he always does, and told him 'LOOK YOU HAD YOUR TIME TO TALK!' Whoa! Talk about the 'No Spin Zone.'. <BR> Al then happly goes after Bush and his administration, and Dick 'Haliburton' Cheny. Al hits everything on the mark about the right, and I did do my research about the things that is discussed in this book. Al then talks about how the Republicans went after President Clinton, and blamed him on the 9/11 tradegy. Instead of taking blame for themselves, they wanted to blame 'the President before them'. I swear, these liars are STUPID! Oh thank you Al, we need you and people like Jim Hightower, Michael Moore, Molly Ivns, and the hard-working liberials.	2004-05-25

Wow, what a read; to begin: Franken sets-up the book great from the beginning.  He lets the reader know WHAT'S UP right from the start.  Franken makes fun of and exposes, using facts and verifiable citations, the ultra-conservative far right media.  My favorite parts in the book include O'Reilly's 2 Peabodys, his book, the trip to Bob Jones University (hillarious), and most of all Wolfowitz's comment regarding &quot;Clinton's military.&quot;  The book is well researched and arguments are well supported.  Does it have a liberal bias?  Just a slight bit.  If you are a conservative, it is going to be a challange to refute a lot of the claims made in the book.  But I'm sure that you can find a justification and an exception for any case, can't you?	2004-05-22

I'll give you that the author is very creative and humorous on his approach and the book could be entertaining as fiction.  But to get to the point that a story is created around real life facts or headlines, a take it as the truth and nothing but the truth is awful.  Why are Liberals so scared of what the likes of O'Reilly,Limbaugh or Hannity talk about.  Only if there is some truth about their statements Liberals should be worried about.  This is for most the main reason why I trust them more that your Liberal media.  They are not ashamed to tell the truth &amp; critizise what needs to be, even if it is coming from the Bush Administration.  I watch FOX news &amp; I admire them.  They have good and instructional discussions, and always give the two sides opinions.  We as americans need to understand that the OPINION of the media is not the absolute word of the land.  We should be educated enough to listen or read or watch all sides, and all their OPINIONS and get to our own conclusions.  What is good for the country, is good for all.  What is bad, should be discarded no matter which side it comes from.  The biggest problem with this country is that everybody takes everything for granted.  People need to confront the reality of countries like Cuba, China &amp; yes Irak, and understand that there is no worst evil than communism, tyrannies and oppresive governments.<BR>I just praise anyone, liberal or republican who has the wisdom to know the difference and do something about it. I hope that the author will have the guts to write about these issues in such a humorous note. These are not laughing matters.	2004-05-20

When you read about all of the lies that have been told to the American public by not only the likes of Limbaugh, Coulter, O'Reilly and Hannity, but also the people who we need to be able to trust - the president and his people, it gets very depressing.<br />Yes, it's depressing, but it is also veeerrryyy funny and amazingly informative.<br />This is a truly scholarly book wrapped in an entertianing package.<br />Highly recommended.

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" (...)<br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give taxbreaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.	2004-05-14

Welcome back, Al! <br />Franken's the real thing, a genuine political satirist who serves his readers trenchant insights into political and social issues of the day along with a number of very big laughs. It's a pleasure watching the pious pontificating of Hannity and O'Reilly and other shills for the Republican party in the media getting punctured like a balloon by Franken's sharp wit. Not all is jolly here though. Franken's chapter on the Paul Wellstone memorial is unbearably moving, although one bristles at the same time at the way Norm Coleman and his GOP minions made political hay out of the event while pretending not to campaign. And &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot; is maybe the best lampooning of the whole mixing of church and state and media I have ever read. <BR>At times the book bogs down, especially when Franken gets into sticky economic issues, but for the most part this is a smooth, fun ride.

Its always a good thing when you find yourself laughing half of the time while reading a book... which I was. After finnishing &quot;Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot&quot; just a month ago, I rushed out and purchased a copy of this book. Franken does a good job at illustrating how Clinton was much more of a people's president than Bush ever will be. <BR>Being a Minnesotan, I especially liked the chapter about Paul Wellstone. I watched the memorial service on television, and I can clearly remembering how that brought closure to the depressing feelings I was having after Wellstone's plane crashed. I can also clearly remember everything that the conservatives were saying about the memorial service. Franken describes it very well in this book.<BR>My favorite part of the whole book was &quot;Operation ChickenHawk Episode One&quot;. It was very ammusing, as was the origianl one done in &quot;Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot&quot;. <BR>All in all I thought the book was another winner. Thanks Al Franken.<BR>One last note... this is to all of the conservatives that are reviewing this book. Unless you have read this book, don't write a review because you have no reason to.

He succeeds in doing what Rush Limbaugh can only aspire to do: deliver deft political commentary with the crafting, timing and finesse of a seasoned, professional comedian.  &quot;Lies&quot; is packed with cathartic laughter, particularly for those who revere news and analysis but have grown disgusted or discouraged with the force-fed polemics of conservative &quot;news&quot; broadcasting, personified by Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity.  As important as the abundant laughter, however, is Team Franken's documented, detailed, credible research substantiating what most of us know intrinsically: there is something institutionally cynical at the heart of Fox News and its commentators.  More than mere political philosophy distinguishes Fox from news and commentary as traditionally practiced by the &quot;Big Three&quot; and public broadcasting networks.  While mediocre pundits rail about the lies of  politicians, Franken makes a sobering, if hilarious, case that lies - big, important ones, in fact - are institutional in a media organization clearly established to serve a specific political demographic or political agenda.	2004-05-10

Drawing on numerous examples of blatant dishonesty and distortion of facts, Franken successfully discredits a number of high profile conservative blowhards such as Anne Coulter, Bill O'Reily and Sean Hannity. He also reveals some of the more flagrant untruths and falsehoods perpetrated by the current Bush administration - from the well known personal life lies of G.W. Bush to the blatant incompetence in dealing with terrorist threats prior to 9/11.  <BR> <BR>The Author's style resembles that of Michael Moore, however unlike Moore, Franken is occasionally funny and with the aid of an enthusiastic bunch of Harvard students, his research and fact checking display more diligence. At times Franken's sarcasm gets a little tiring bordering on childishness. Although, considering the hysterical finger wavers at whom he is taking aim, the tone is about right.<br />Franken makes the observation that supporters of the right's staunchest proponents are only interested in hearing what confirms their pre-conceived opinions. Ironically that's exactly the type of audience that this book appeals to. Franken encourages an attitude of us against them, liberal versus conservative but fails to address that behind the facade of left versus right, there is little difference in the ideological beliefs of either camp. More important issues get lost amongst the Democratic/Republican pissing contest. For example, the phrase 'government for the people by the people'is now an anachronism Eit's true nature  more akin to a private club representing corporate interests regardless of the persuasion veiled beneath platitudes of democracy and freedom to mollify the masses. Anyone with their eyes open will recognise the yawning gap between the rhetoric and reality.<br />To be fair, Franken doesn't pretend to tackle such issues, and even if such conundrums do concern him they are not the topicof this book. The agenda of &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them&quot; is to expose the often brazen dishonesty and barefaced lies of the right - and on that score Franken is successful.	2004-05-08

The book is no doubt humorous, even some conservatives admit to laughing in a few places.  The problem I found with this book is that not everything is true (I am not sure if that was intended as a pun on the title or a mistake).  He criticizes Ann Coulter on her 780 references claiming she lied.  As in my Ann Coulter review I pointed out, that she did her research very well and I know because it was for a project we had to check her research (it's called Journalism).  The next problem I find with this book is the chapter &quot;I'm a Bad Liar&quot; (ironically named).  The President of BJU denies that Al Franken ever visited their university.  I don't know whether to believe a university of high morals or an author who can't stop using the F-word.  Although many people will find this book funny, and no doubt it is, there has to be some questions as to why the author felt the need to make stuff up.	2004-05-04

Very rarely do I read laugh-out-loud funny books. I am very happy to add this book to the list.<br />As I read this book, I kept turning back to copyright page in shock. I could not believe that it was printed in September 2003. Fact after fact that were just shockingly \\"uncovered\\" during the 9/11 hearings were right there in plain sight, months before the mainstream media picked up on them up during Condi Rice's infamous public testimony before the 9/11 committee. On page 120 and 162, Franken goes into deep detail about the now infamous Aug. 6, 2001 PDB, even including the title: \\"Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.\\"<br />The day of Condi Rice's testimony, Chris Matthews of \\"Hardball\\" (who I like and respect) went on and on about how he had never heard of this PDB and how shocking it was. I thought the exact same thing until now, a few weeks later, and low and behold Franken had it right there in plain sight months ago. (Come on Chris! Expand your reading list a little bit!)<br />What is equally fascinating is how he exposes the lies and distortions of people like Limbaugh, Hannity, Coulter and O'Reilly. It is almost like these far-right conservations refuse to think about what they are saying. And then when their statements are proved wrong, they get all defensive and go back to the tried and true response of blaming everything on Bill Clinton. <br />Al Franken's 14 person \\"research staff \\", all of them students, deserves accolades and hopefully a cut from the profits of this book by doing miraculous research in meticulously exposing these lies and distortions.<br />One can only come away from this book with the impression that the \\"hate America first\\" crowd is really the Limbaughs, Coulters, O'Reillys and Hannitys of the world. These types are sick twisted people who have lost their moral compass and have begun to believe their own lies. The hypocrisy of their public statements is most disturbing. Whileit was perfectly acceptable for them to fling hate at the previous administration, anyone saying virtually the exact same things about GW is suddenly \\"unpatriotic\\" and a \\"traitor.\\" This is pure hypocrisy.<br />Now a personal request to Al Franken. Please, please start ghost-writing speeches for John Kerry. It is imperative he get elected and your incredible wit and insight might turn the tide. Talk to him! Coach him! I beg of you do this for America.<br />Now a few negatives about the book. Not every section is funny or appropriate. I thought the extended chickenhawks fighting in Vietnam wasn't that funny and it went on too long. The book would have just as good without this section.<br />Besides that, kudos to Al Franken for writing a courageous and funny book.	2004-05-02

Meanwhile Bush and the Republicans have generally got a pass. Only when it became painfully obvious in Iraq and on the economic front that things were not going as planned did the media even start to question what was going on. When Al Franken's book came out several months ago, it was the beginning of a period of rocky times for the rightist government. The problem with this book is that when Franken attempts to be humorous he comes across not as funny but rather as pretty boorish. Micheal Moore I think has the same problem. But I agree totally with his thesis that the right wing media has been spewing out either tabloid stories or distortions of the facts.	2004-04-30

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It features a 15 year-old crack whore performing fellatio and depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give tax breaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<br />This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.	2004-04-29

You see, they love America the way a four-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a four-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow. Love takes attention and work and is the best thing in the world.&quot;<br />Do Conservatives think that everything about America is wonderful? What wabout Welfare, Social Security, Progressive Taxes, and Public Education, and legal abortion? OK, Franken is really talking about foriegn policy, but what about Bob Novack and Pat Buchanan? They have criticized Bush on the war. Also, there was plenty of criticism of US foreign policy from the right in the 1990's. Conservatives love America despite the liberal parts they dislike.

Note that Amazon reviewers commented over 500 times on O'Reilly's latest book, while this book has over 2,700.  But, those are just numbers manipulated by someone other than Amazon.	2004-04-21

In much more eloquent language, this is the message of Al Franken's hilarious yet disturbing book.  The right is lying to you, and you're falling for it. (Hence, the disturbing statistic that 34% of Americans believe that we have already found WMD in Iraq.)<br />Franken takes on everything in this book:  the crazies at Fox News and their associates (Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, etc.); Bob Jones University; the distortions and outright lies told by both Bush and Cheney; the sick Conservative spin on Paul Wellstone's &quot;overly partisan&quot; memorial service.  Even Barbara Bush is not safe from his exposes.<br />I don't usually respond to other reviewer's comments, but I found one too good to let slide.  A reviewer wrote that Franken didn't back up his allegations--all that he could find bad to say about Ann Coulter is that what she calls &quot;endnotes&quot; are actually &quot;footnotes&quot;.  Yes, Franken does point this out.  But this reviewer must not have been reading the part where Ann Franken wrote that the New York Times was too elitist to run a story on the death of Dale Earnhardt until three days after his death, and then only in the back pages.  Did you miss the part where Franken included the front page of the New York Times from the day after the accident, and there was a story about the crash?  What about the part where she said she was &quot;friendly with&quot; Franken after meeting him only once for a few seconds?  How about where she wrote &quot;Even during the media's nightly flogging of Iran-Contra, Reagan's approval ratings fell only five percentage points&quot;, when they actually fell from 63 to 47%?<br />To people like this reviewer, the hope of instilling them with any insight as a result of reading this book is a lost cause.  They don't want to know the truth, and they have imitated the right's trick of distortion, ommission and lies.  To everyone who actually wants to know what is going on with your president and the press, this book is an eye-opener.  Al Franken for president!	2004-04-21

Most books on current politics, if they can be taken at all, are best taken in VERY small doses, sometimes less than a full chapter per day. Franken's book, however, is one you can sit and read for extended periods without becoming ill.<br />Unlike Nader's pet doctrinaire-leftist toady, Michael Moore, Al Franken is no extremist, and unlike Moore's lame attempts at humor, Franken's jokes are actually funny.<br />Franken never once spouts Socialist or doctrinaire-leftist diatribes, and never once characterizes Clinton or Gore as a Republican in a cheap suit. Instead, he uses dead-on facts, humor, and the occasional piece of illustrative fiction (including an entire chapter taking the form of a comic book) to skewer targets ranging from President Bush and his cronies to Bob Jones University.<br />My one issue of accuracy was in Franken's characterization of Coulter as having the personality of a dominatrix. I've met a dominatrix (thankfully not professionally!), and that characterization is grossly unfair. To dominatrixes.<br />Buy this, and buy Conason's &quot;Big Lies,&quot; and Brock's &quot;Blinded by the Right,&quot; but avoid Michael Moore the way you avoid his fellow (if diametrically opposite) lunatics, Coulter and Hannity!	2004-04-20

It's amazing the amount of dirt Franken has dug up on the present administration. The &quot;liberal&quot; media is a joke in more ways than one.  The over-arching principle of the Bush administration and its supporters seems to be that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it.  We saw this at Bush's press conference the other night.  He said the same things over and over (&quot;consoling the families of the fallen soldiers, who are fighting for our country's freedom...&quot; &quot;...stay the course..&quot; etc.) while not really answering most of the questions posed him. So Bush et al chant their mantra of let freedom ring, while systematically taking away those freedoms, national integrity goes down the tubes, and the liar is king!  It's enough the chill the blood of the staunchest patriot.	2004-04-20

Franken claims to have exposed &quot;the right&quot; as liars. He wants his readers to conclude that the right makes more noise than sense. How does he go about trying to do this? He selects out the least capable opponents he can find.<br />To Franken, a fair and balanced look at the right means attacking media personas like Bill O'Reilly, Anne Coulter, and Sean Hannity. While it is true that these figures are, shall we say, excitable, they are hardly the best opponents to Welfare State Liberalism.<br />If Franken really wanted to devastate opponents to the modern welfare/regulatory state, he should have gone after the most capable  of these opponents available. Franken could have written a chapter on John Stossel. Stossel is, after all, an important critic of big government. However, Stossel does not rant like Sean Hannity, he just lays out the facts in a sober fashion. Franken could have written a chapter on Walter Williams. Williams has written much in the popular media, and fills in for Rush Limbaugh on WABC. However this would mean taking on a real expert (Williams is an economist). Franken would rather take on O'Reilly, who tries to comment on everything and is therefore an expert on nothing. Tom Sowell is another economist, and widely read critic of big government that Franken avoided. He would rather call Anne Coulter \\"a nutcase\\" than risk entering into a real debate.<br />Interestingly enough, Franken accuses Hanity of employing this very tactic. He claims that Hanity wants Alan Colmes as an opponent because Colmes is a weak  opponent. Not only is this claim hypocritical, it is arguably false. Franken seems to measure the effectiveness of ones argumentation by how loud and animated they are. Fox News leftists like Alan Colmes and Juan Williams are not as animated as Begala and Carville at CNN, but that makes them more effective  to many people. There are many loudmouth idiots in the media, who rant and rave instead of presenting serious arguments. Apparently Franken feels comfortable participating in this kind of non debate.<br />The bottom line is that Franken fails even against the few he selected out as opponents for this book. Mostly, he is does what he accuses his opponents of doing. He slings mud, distorts the facts, and engages in seemingly deliberate deception. He does cite some real sources and evidence, but he does not understand much of it. He even caves in to Supply Side economics without realizing it (on p295). He also engages in near constant personal attacks. Franken seems quite at home in the gutter of popular debate.<br />I got what I paid for from this book.

Spend 10 minutes of your life to operate google to check if his facts are correct and lo' and behold, they are.

Obviously so many people lost the message here: those \\"nutcases\\" that he name-called are serial name-callers themselves, so let's see if we turn it the other way around. Of course, the name-calling comes after he bitch-slapped them first with hypocrisies, lies, distortions, etc.<br />Unfortunately, this book so-bashes the right wing that it will only find readers among the believers, and the conservatives will be turned off even before opening the book (but still put up a 'review' without opening a page).

I don't really think the Right is his 'target audience' here - just his target.  Those who pontificate on the vast number of Right-oriented talk shows that crowd the radio and television airwaves aren't likely to change their opinions or tactics under the influence of Al Franken (Arianna Huffington's conversion aside...).  I see Al more as a cheerleader for those already in the Liberal camp, a munitions supplier of ideas and facts, if you will.  My ex-wife has a great expression about what Al does - she calls it 'preaching to the choir', and it's an astute, perfectly apt description.  The implication of course, is that the choir is already firmly in the preacher's trench - but who knows what might happen if they are inspired to sing a bit louder, with more feeling and commitment...?<br />My friend had a point - the zeal with which Franken pursues his foes ('LIARS...!!'), combined with his piercing wit and his sometimes potentially-offensive language, could, I'll admit, put some people off.  Personally, I found it hilarious to the point of producing tears - but more importantly, backed up by meticulously researched source and background data.  There are a lot of personal opinions contained in this book - but the amount of verifiable information is quite stunning.  Subject by subject, point by point, lie by lie, distortion by...well, you get the idea...Franken exposes the methods of the Right like a surgeon going after a particularly elusive malignancy (an apt simile, if I do say so myself...).  It's tempting to dive into a discussion with one's friends or coworkers of the opposite political persuasion with a hearty 'Oh YEAH...?!!' - but in order for productive discourse to occur (hopefully without resorting to schoolyard fisticuffs), it's a good idea to have a quiver of facts with which to reload your bow again and again, sending barb after barb into enemy flesh...sorry, I got a little worked up there.

Actually, nothing could be further from the truth.<br />The book is funny, but in a serious way.  Between jokes and funny stories, Franken meticulously documents untruths that have been put forward as fact by politicians and pundits.  Along the way he makes a distinction between mistakes and lies -- mistakes are withdrawn, corrected and not repeated.  He documents that in many cases lies are repeated louder the second time.<br />As a democratic society, we depend on the press and our representatives to help us make good choices based on the facts.  It is reasonable for us to hold political commentators to a standard -- it's fine to have a viewpoint and express it, but not to support that viewpoint with falsehoods.  Hopefully, this book will help make the targeted pundits more careful with the facts, and more apt to acknowledge their mistakes rather than turning them into lies.<br />A reasonable criticism of this book is that he only takes aim at the pundits of the right.  Have pundits of the left been similarly loose with the truth?  The job of exposing them is left to an author with different motives.	2004-04-16

Similar clear and factual evidence of lying is presented for every liar cited in this work. (3) If Rush, Hannity, and O'Leilly are truth tellers, than the definition of truth has shifted dramatically since I last looked it up. (4) The reason so many copies of this book are lying around (no pun intended), is due to the fact its wildly successful. Lies made its debut about the same time as O'Leilly's Whos Looking Out For You. Yet its O'Leilly's book that you can now find only in dumpsters. (...)	2004-04-16

Can it get any worse for this fat, steel wool-haired, Buddy Holly glasses wearing  pig?  The answer, sadly, is yes.  He'll blame the &quot;vast right wing&quot; for sabotaging his radio show.  He says that the LIES in this . . . this . . . thing (it is only a book according to the dictionary because it has pages with words - but they are filled with dozens of lies and statements taken out of context) that his mean-spiritedness and cruelty to other, much more influential members of American culture, is simply satire.  It is amazing - if a Republican/Conservative would have said some of the things that this no-talent, over rated, worthless, liberal swine said on the pages of this &quot;book&quot;, Alley would have been the first one to stand up and cry about it.  What a hypocrite.  Al, you told us you were going to do &quot;drug-free radio&quot; (your VERY funny slap at Rush Limbaugh's SELF-ADMITTED prescription drug dependency).  You should have given FREE uppers to anyone who dared to tune in.  Maybe then you would have held their attention long enough to stay on the air more than a few weeks.  It won't be long until the other stations drop you as well - just as I predicted a few months ago.<br />If you people out there really want to read a book by a REPUTABLE liberal, buy Alan Colmes book.  I hardly ever agree with Alan, but at least he is above name-calling (something that can't be said about the ignorant, unfunny Franken) and is willing to discuss the issues instead of pointing the finger of blame at any and everyone but himself!<br />The O'Franken Factor?  Do you not have an original thought in your minuscule, warped mind, Al?  Do you ALWAYS have to elicit the REAL movers and shakers of our time for your retched little endeavors?  Can you do ANYTHING without attempting to steal a bit of spotlight from Rush, Sean or Bill?  The answer is NO.  <br />Face it, folks.  This is not a book that you will glean any information from.  You will not learn another point of view from it.  You'll only get name-calling, finger pointing and a great many LIES from the king of all Liars himself, Al (I've got a face for radio but no audience) Franken.<br />If you are looking to buy a book to agree with (if you are of the far-left liberal crowd) then by all means, buy this piece of garbage.  You'll not have any trouble finding one . . . there are DOZENS piled up in your local bookstore and close to 50 here on Amazon.  If you are indeed an \\"Independent\\" thinker, then don't waste your time.  <br />This book is as classless as the washed-up, parody of himself clown without an original bone in his body - Al Franken.<br />Why don't you just retire and let some new blood get some spotlight?  Just have ONE original joke every once in awhile . . . that's all we ask, Al.  But that's just too much for you, isn't it?  You are a disgrace to America.  Do us all a favor - take your family and yourself and all of your books (the thousands left on the shelves of the Nation's bookstores gathering dust) and go over and entertain Osama and the rest of your friends.  I'm sure they would LOVE your \\"humor\\".	2004-04-15

I thought the title was a bit biased, however I read the book.  If you are into left wing propaganda and lies, without any evidence this is the book for you.  I think Franken is far worse than anyone that he reviews in his book.  For instance his chapter on Ann Coulter is entitled Ann Coulter: Nutcase.  And then he proceeds to tell you that she is a liar since she used end notes instead of footnotes, and she had so many of them that she was obviously lying.<br />If you can find humor in a very poorly documented book that calls everyone else a liar without producing any evidence, this book full of useless diatribe is for you.	2004-04-15

I've never taken issue with him as a comedian.  I'm able to laugh even if I don't agree with someone's politics.  I read this book because I wanted to see the other side.  I'm sorry I did.  While his cause may have been noble, the book was severely hypocritical.  While he bashes Ann Coulter for name calling, it seems to me, he has the market cornered.  He didn't make much of a case for documenting anything he said either.  Ane he does a real good job of taking things out of context in order to suit his argument.  If the book is read with the thought in mind that it's funny, it will satisfy the reader.  If you are looking for a true, intelligent, political discourse... try somewhere else.	2004-04-14

Kudos to you Al for exposing these Neocons for who they really are. O'Reilly is really a liar of the worst sort because he tells so many lies he thinks he is telling the truth. He is pathological in the sense that he comes down hard on anyone he perceives to be lying or not telling the story the way he wants it told. O'Reilly is a perfect example of someone who hates others for what he sees in himself. Al pointed out in this book at least 3 major O'Reilly lies: that he is an independent voter (his voting card shows he checked off Republican), Then he stated he checked Republican because democrat was the only other option available (the voter card clearly shows sevreral other options), his bald-faced lie about receiving a Peabody award, and that he was a poor kid from Levitown when in reality he is from the more affluent Westbury. Some may say, \\"so what, these are minor indescretions\\". But if a person is lying about fairly minor things you can bet the ranch he is lying about larger more important things. Bill O'Leilly continues these same lies to this day, last week on his radio show saying he has always been politically independent and is from Levitown. He maintains that his show is where you get the facts and absolute truth (as does Sham Hannity). I have always been very leery of someone who has the truth and can tell me exactly what it is. And any thinking person should be that way also. What I really liked about this book is the \\"FAIR AND BALANCED\\" title that Fox and O'leilly went after Al over. They, of course, were laughed out of court. True to form, O'leilly maintained it was Fox who sued, not him. Liar, liar pants on fire. The truth is, Al Franken is a lot smarter than Bill O'leilly and clearly OUTFOXED him! (pun intended) Even right wing Drudge caught O'leilly in a lie when O'leilly stated his book was neck and neck with Al's book and closing in on Hillary's for top sales. The truth is O'leilly was being outsold 3 to 2 by Al, and nearly 2 to 1 by Hillary. Great work Al. I really look forward to your next book. I really do want the truth!	2004-04-12

One thing I love about his work is that he attacks right-wing pundits with intelligence, humor and logic, some traits his targets lack. Rather than do all the research of these lies himself (which would indeed require tremendous fortitude), Mr. Franken enlists the aid of students from Harvard University. What better group to dissect the lies than a team of intelligent, educated people? Besides, who can actually take Limbaugh, Coulter, et al with a modicum of seriousness? Limbaugh has never had credibility and Coulter lost what pittance she had when she shed her dignity and joined the campaign to oust Clinton from office (I'm sure it was well before then, but who knows what she did prior to that). From what I can glean from their antics, they apparently compete to outdo one another to see how outrageous and preposterous they can make their claims while still maintaining the guise of legitimate work (needless to say they fail to pull it off). This provides Franken with the perfect venue for his satire, which he employs most deftly to counteract the Right's punditry and expose them as the Charlatans and liars they are. It is the perfect scenario: the Right attempting with a straight face to pass off absurd lies, only to have their arguments both mocked and simultaneously dismantled by a person of vastly superior intellect. It is great fun to read and serves as terrific reminder of how ridiculous, shameless and pathetic these right-wing pundits truly are.<br />I deduct half a star because this book is marred by the same affliction as his previous effort, \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot,\\" which are his tangents about his family and other distractions. I am sure his family is wonderful and he loves them very much, but why interject those anecdotes into this book? It detracts from the central theme and crux of his arguments. Other than that minor grievance, however, this book is perfect.ral theme and crux of his arguments. Other than that minor grievance, however, this book is perfect.	2004-04-11

Yes, Franken makes jokes when possible but as comedic relief. <BR> <BR>The book is a thoroughly researched dissertation of a corrupted media advancing the questionable agenda of the radical right wing element represented by the Bush administration.<BR>  <BR>This book chronicles the outright lying of the right wing &quot;journalists&quot; and highlights their doublespeak when it isn't actually a technical lie.<br />Also well documented is the Bush/Rove administration's flagrant hypocrisy. It is shown that they will do anything to get in and stay in power.  This includes dirty tricks, outright lies, doublespeak, and misinformation.  These tactics are all undertaken while wearing the smile, white hat, and slick speak of snakeoil salesmen pushing a toxic brew to those who would love for it to be true.<br />Unfortunately those who are swallowing their lies in hopes of it being true are also those least willing to accept straight facts pointing out the deceptions.  They don't realize that it is they who are being most used because they only true Bush agenda isn't even a true ultra-conservative agenda.  It is just that those ultra-conservatives are most likely to accept that Bush's policies are in furtherance of that agenda.<br />They will realize they are being duped when someday they put together that Bush's only agenda is keeping the rich rich and staying in power to do that.  The Medicare bill is a great example.  An anathema to the right, this bill's true effect is to further enrich the pharmaceutical industry and its fatcats.<br />This book is a must read for all who want to see the playbook of this administration and to be enlightened to the way in which their media lapdogs at FOX further those aims.	2004-04-11

He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" <br />Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It (...) depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong.

I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over.

His book was a page turner because he accurately checked his information and placed it in footnotes, and because he then made me laugh.

The reader reviews reflect the degree to which the Bush Administration and conservative media has polarized the political debate. Americans would do well to travel and see how other people around the world feel about their governments actions. Unfortunately far too large a number could care less what the rest of the world thinks. I am somewhat taken aback by those readers who rate the book one star and back their ratings up with childish name calling and libelous attacks. I suspect these people have not even read the book or if they have read it the did so with their opinion already formed. We are in the middle of  a dark chapter of American politics and I can only pray that the American public will come to their senses and send the Bush administration packing this fall.	2004-03-31

Franken goes into excruciating detail on everyone from Sean Hannity right on up the ladder to George W. Bush himself.  The most poignant chapter in the book is Franken's one page chapter on our &quot;National Dialogue on Terrorism&quot;.  In this brief chapter, Franken, in a pseudo-conversation of alternating quotes brings to the forefront the far-right's presumed view on concepts like terror, patriotism, and freedom.  Overall, Franken brings up many strong, well-researched points, but if the book has a downside it's that Franken is overly repetative, and at times incessant getting his point across.

The Hannity/Coulter ultra-conservative cult encourages an oversimplified approach to the world, in many cases devoid of actual facts. The facts they do mention are so twisted and misrepresented it's almost sinful to call them facts. Republicans make strong arguments in some key issues, but with mouthpieces like this making the case, it's hard not to dismiss it all as drivel. In addition, Franken offers perspectives you may not have heard before about: the truth about Al Gore's problem with lying, Bill Clinton's attempts to thwart terrorism, what really happened at Paul Wellstone's memorial, amongst other issues. His most astute commentary may be that the mainstream media is neither Liberal nor Conservative, but they are lazy. Through it all, Franken's sharp sense of humor dominates the book. Anyone with an open mind can enjoy his jokes and one liners in spite of political idealogy. The book's not perfect (I could have done without the chicken-hawk and Supply Side Jesus cartoons), but it does provide a much needed balance to the political discussion. As you prepare to consider your vote for '04, give Franken's book a look. Let him report and you can decide.	2004-03-29

For quite some time,  neo-cons have suggested that they are the Davids in a world of liberal Goliaths and the battle-ground is  the media with Goliath having the home court advantage.<br />Franken has empowered me with a feeling that I already had, but was afraid to show. We here time and again how evil the liberals are and yet, I never felt evil. I never felt as if I was un-American but was told again and again by Larry Elder, Bill Orielly, Sean Hannity, Rush... that I hate this country.<br />I will say this now. I love this country. I will scream it... <br />I was afraid most of all that Franken would reduce himself to scream back over the fence with the same tactics used by the right and was pleased to find that this just was not the case. His clear rhetoric gives a voice to the liberals that does not exist, if only because fighting the loudest of the neo-cons requires denials of so many lies flung by the right that the meer constant defense implicates them. Because of this, liberals tend to shy away from comfrontation with the right. In a rather un-Michael Moorish way, Al rallies the troups with truth about these lies that have been slung for so long now.<br />If you are a liberal, read this book.

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times. <br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media. <br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" (...) <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. After all, the top 20 reasons for going to war stated by Bush, Cheny, Powell, and Rice have ALL been PROVEN wrong. We give taxbreaks to the rich, yet the Bush administration announces they want to cut back on Social Security benefits. <br />WOW! Don't you see something wrong with this?<BR>This book is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations. <br />Red Rover, Red Rover, let the illegal aliens come over, and over, and over. They draw Social Security Benefits, we pay for their schooling, health care and they take jobs that Americans DO WANT. Corporations are able to suppress wages; proof is that the Gov itself shows that minimum wages should be at 9.00 dollars an hour to keep up with 1950s buying power, yet corporate CEOs are making 400 times what them made in the 50s. Conservatives wake up; you are paying for corporate welfare. Al Frankin's thoughts are right on. <br />If you are open minded and looking for those books begging for its pages to be turned...look no further. I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program `insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. I also really liked Dan Brown's `Angels and Demons.' Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban.

Yes, I am a liberal, and I knew that there were distortions and exaggerations going on (by both liberals and conservatives, to be fair), but I didn't realize there were such blatant lies being told.  I guess I'm naive that way -- I want to believe people are honest. <br />Franken has actual evidence for the lying he points out!  I didn't really expect that -- I was thinking more of the humor when I picked up the book.  So I was surprised.<br />Yes, the book made me laugh, but it also made me think seriously. <br />I was also interested that Franken seems to share some of my own naivete' -- he admits to sometimes actually being &quot;charmed&quot; by George W. Bush, for instance.  I've definitely been in that position.  I'm a Christian, and I do believe in seeking and following God's guidance, which Bush claims he does also.  So I've wanted to believe that he's sincere.  I've prayed that God *will* guide him.  But lately I just feel disillusioned.<br />Franken describes being &quot;charmed&quot; when he met Bush, and tells that he actually supported the war on Saddam Hussein originally.<br />In summary, I enjoyed the book, I related to a lot of what Franken wrote, and it made me think.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-03-25

It sheds a lot of light on the games and deceptions that some politicians and a lot of the media engage in.  He does a great job of researching the facts in his book and showing how people like O'Reilly, Hannity and Coulter distort facts for their own objectives and have no real journalistic integrity.  I think both so-called liberals and and those in the center will enjoy this book, but those on the &quot;right-wing&quot; will naturally avoid it.  I think Franken is a bit too glowing in some of his comments regarding the Clinton administration, but all in all, most of his comments ring very true once he lays out his research into topics such as politics, 9/11, and economics.

He finally hit upon the idea of having a group of students do research for his book. They bought the idea.<br /> His first target is Ann Coulter, author of Scandal. Franken methodically picks apart her book, revealing it for the inaccurate, if not disingenuous, piece of nonsense it is. He also shows how she has blatantly lied about things.  Her Connecticut driver's license shows her birth date as 1961; her Washington DL says 1963.  She claims the Washington DL is correct, which means she voted as a sixteen-year-old.  On one of the applications she lied about her age. Now, many people have done that, but since the US Patriot Act makes it a felony to put false information on a government ID, she could be whisked away and held without counsel for a long time.  I wish they would.  Simple charges she makes in her book were never checked.  For example, she complains that Evan Thomas, supposedly one of those heinous liberals, was the son of Norman Thomas, four-time [sic] candidate for president on the Socialist party ticket. Actually, he ran six times, and a simple phone call to Evan Thomas reveals that he is not the son of Norman Thomas.  Coulter's book is filled with such false details.  Either she is extremely lazy or a blatant liar.  Franken obviously suspects the latter.<br /> Francken has infuriated that scion of right-wing Fox Bill O'Reilly by publicly pointing out many untruths that O'Reilly has put forth. At Book Expo in Los Angeles, O'Reilly was humiliated by Franken, who categorically listed all sorts of lies O'Reilly had perpetrated on the public. Now, Franken makes clear that occasionally making a mistake on a statistic is hardly a crime, but O'Reilly's customary tactic, when challenged with the correct information from unimpeachable sources is to simply bully and yell at his challenger rather than correct the mistake.  The problem is also that he makes lots of mistakes.  More from the \\"sewer of right-wing dishonesty.  When he interviewed the son of a worker killed on 9/11 on February 4th, 2003, he became enraged at the son's opposition to the war in Iraq, had his engineer cut off the man's microphone, and sent him packing saying to him after the show's end,  \\"Get out of my studio before I tear you to f*cking pieces.\\"  <br /> O'Reilly, who constantly rails at the lyrics of rap songs, wrote a murder mystery in 1998, Those who Trespass (about a serial killer who murders everyone who interferes with his rising television career), that took explicit sex and violence to new heights and the English language to new lows. In one murder, the victim is killed by having a spoon driven through the roof of her mouth into her brain stem. Variants of the \\"F\\" word and \\"B\\" word are used more than 51 times. Case of the pot calling the kettle black? O'Reilly is not a nice man. <br /> Team Franken took a look at Hannity's (of Hannity and Colmes,) book to verify the factualness of his statements. Examples of disingenuousness and dishonesty abound. <br /> Bush's initial indifference to al Qaeda prior to 9/11 is astonishing.  The Clinton administration had developed plans for eliminating Bin Laden, but those plans were ignored.  That the Bin Laden family were good friends with the Bush family is well-known, and Franken speculates as to what might have happened to Clinton had he been so nice to the Bin Laden family, permitting aSaudi plane to fly around the country picking up family members for return to Saudi Arabia, while American airplanes were grounded.  In the meantime, President Bush has broken all presidential records for the number of days spent on vacation.<br /> The book is often uneven, some parts funnier and some more serious.  Should one laugh or cry learning that many of our leaders today, Cheney, Wolfowitz, Perle, Bush, and other chickenhawks who are sending men off to die in war, did everything in their power, having their fathers pull strings and inventing flimsy excuses (shouldn't pick on Limbaugh, I think he was just too fat) to avoid service in Vietnam.	2004-03-25

Well, unfortunately for Mr. Franken former President Bill Clinton has admitted that this is the absolute truth and that he regretted this over any thing else that happened in his administration. It appears he asked Janet Reno if we should accept the offer's from the Sudan and Reno's opinion was that we did not have the evidence to try him yet. So Clinton said NO to the 3 offers from the Sudan. On the last offer he told to Sudan to let Osama go on to Afghanistan well, Mr. frankin maybe I should write a book about you lying, you got some explaining to do.	2004-03-23

The only point I have a problem with is using the same tools and methods described by Mr. Franken himself you could spin the facts he presents as well. As much as he slams Rush and Hannity for being on one side he approaches the opposite side with the same blind devotion.<br />In their eyes Bush can do no wrong and the way Mr. Franken talks about Clinton you could almost picture Al following Bill around like a lost puppy.<br />Both sides have issues and neither side is without a flaw, if anything I can thank both Rush and Mr. Franken for pushing me into seeking out a third party that is not simply a puppet with a different face.	2004-03-22

Did any of the people who rated this book with only one star actually bother to read it?!?!  Franken does a first class job at exposing how many Republicans distort and factually mislead the public.  His analysis of books by Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, and Sean Hannity were FACTUAL and undermine their integrity.  He does so truthfully and without spin.  Even the most die-hard of Republicans should read this book and take a hard, honest look at who's out there publicizing their beliefs (after reading the Ann Coulter chapters, I can't image ANY true republican wanting her as a party spokesperson.)

The book is largely broken up into dozens of small chapters that can be read in a few minutes.<br />Franken goes after a few easy targets with amusing results - O'Reilly and Coulter are almost too easy for him.  But his assault on Sean Hannity is brutal, Hannity is exposed for the partisan hack he is with a merciless recounting of his own stupid work.<br />The book later moves into different territory with mixed results. His trip to Bob Jones university and his operation chickenhawk sketch fall flat under the thinness of their gags and the constant quoting of Bill O'Reilly's sex writing loses it's comic zeal.  Franken's comic timing seems best suited to short, sharp jabs.<br />The book's most memorable chapter is his account of the funeral of Paul Wellstone and the subsequent distortion of it by the 'liberal' media.  This is the the long chapter that works the best as it is driven by a moving story and Franken's anger to those who tried to rubbish the legacy of this great man after years of misrepresenting and ridiculing him.<br />Despite some parts of the book not working well overall it is a splendid read, uproariously funny at times.  However Franken's message is ultimately serious.<br />Through History both personal and general Franken makes an argument for a social-democratic agenda in governemnt, and this is where the book finishes well.<br />This is book is more than just a partisan screed, it is worth noting that in his very public turn against Bush, Howard Stern noted this book was crucial in his change of mind.<br />Let's hope a few more people read it before November.	2004-03-21

It pays special attention to Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly.  O'Reilly once violently threatened a man who lost his father in 9-11 because the man didn't support the war in Iraq.  He then went on to spread lies about the man.  This book has a transcript of Hannity lying about Al Gore.  This book was not as funny as Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot.  It has a more serious tone.  It does have alot of funny parts though.  I especially liked the cartoon Supply Side Jesus.  Some reviewers don't seem to understand that Franken's subtitle A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right was meant to be ironic.  The Fox news network uses the slogan Fair and Balanced.  They then go on to be blatantly biased against democrats.  Fox tries to make democrats look as dumb as they can.  Franken doesn't mean for this book to be fair.  He was making a joke and giving conservatives a taste of their own medicine.	2004-03-19

It is only too bad that Al is a comedian, because he'd make a great president.  After all, it seems that the qualifications for the job aren't much anymore, so why not Al Franken.  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them gives the real lowdown on the lowest people in America, from George Bush to Ann Coulter to Bill O'Reilly, all of the lying liars are covered in this great romp.  Another good thing about Al's book is that he documents what he says.  You won't find documentation in O'Reilly's books or Ann's books.  But then again, they probably don't really write their own books anyway.  <BR>Al leaves no stone unturned as he exposes some of the biggest, most absurd people in modern history.

I am pretty middle of the road when it comes to politics (or at least that's how I see myself), and I'll take Bill O'Reilly any day over Al Franken. O'Reilly has integrity, enthusiasm, and his views are those of an independent thinker. Look at Franken's criticisms of O'Reilly: Franken says O'Reilly was once a registered republican, Franken says O'Reilly is not where he says he's from, and he offers several examples of O'Reilly losing his cool. Okay, so here's Bill O'Reilly, who has 3 books, is on TV every night and on the radio every day, and this all that Franken can talk about??!! Franken merely adapts the liberal agenda and puts it in his own voice-- at least O'Reilly, like or hate him, has his own views. Franken is not an independent thinker, he is a pawn of the liberal media.<br />I don't mean for this review to be about how O'reilly is better than Franken, but I think that by contrasting the two it is easy to see Franken's extreme short-comings as a writer and an analyst.	2004-03-18

However, I'll take this space to beef about one concept of the book that I did not enjoy and seems pervasive in all &quot;liberal&quot; books: hero worship of Bill Clinton.  Now, Bill Clinton was not the worst President ever, but why do smart people like Franken act as though he is the best ever?  It's not because of they're smart and it's not because they are correct.  Bill Clinton, obviously, is a slime who time and time again humiliated his office.  Agreed, Republicans wasted this countries time and energy on affairs that were none of their business and Clinton did have some excellent policies (as well as policies, such as cutting welfare, that were straight robbed from the GOP playbook), but that doesn't change that Clinton was a slime.

It's time the 'right' wake up in this country and show some real &quot;compassionate&quot; conservatism. Spreading lies, covering up the truth and what not is no way to win over the &quot;liberals&quot; to their cause. Besides, I think Al Franken encourages everyone (if you read between the lines) that it's about time we define the word 'liberal,' and that born-again Christians in this country start showing some respect for their fellow citizens' rights and opinions if they want to preserve their (already very weak) credibility.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this latest Al Franken book, and I would have given it five stars if it weren't for one of the chapters that appears to be more fill than anything else.	2004-03-17

Who provides arguments instead of venomous mud-slinging and name calling?<br />Finally, one would also note that the doctrinaire right wing types will suggest that liberals are ivy tower dwellers, and go so far as to suggest that perhaps liberals might be too smart for their own good . . . this county has a pretty long history of anti-intellectualism, clearly, but wouldn't you expect the smart people to also be the ones who are right?  Just some food for thought . . . I hope that our friends can digest it . . .	2004-03-12

His wit on SNL was not quite me, but as a political satirist, he is in the genius category - in my humble opinion.  After recent events in the 2004 political campaign, I have started re-reading this book.  It was thought provoking, entertaining, funny, sometimes infuriating the first time I read it.  Infuriating not at the author, but at those &quot;Lying Liars&quot;.  Reading it the second time, within the context of this presidential campaign, it is most revealing.  I find myself referring to this book as a literal reference source for discussions with people, contacting politicians, writing letters to the editor, and finding facts or clarity about facts that are brought up in the news.  <BR>I was puzzled with the &quot;outrage&quot; by the Bush group at recent comments by Kerry &quot;the biggest bunch of crooks and liars&quot;, etc.  Then, I remembered something in the book, and voila, there it was:(pg 352) Franken writes, &quot;Yes. Lying is a serious matter. And calling the President of the United States a liar is not something I say with any relish or self-satisfaction&quot; -- Ah, Hah, the &quot;L&quot; word.  I don't remember any calls for Franken to apologize, maybe there were? He continues, &quot;Bush lies about important things. Like the economy, his tax cuts, education, our reasons for going to war... But I think he lies only when he feels he has to.&quot;  The truth hurts, as they say.<BR>I HIGHLY recommend this book to those who have an open mind and a desire for the truth. The fact that it is presented with humor is a great bonus!	2004-03-12

I am a lifelong Republican and activist. My party stands for those who are successful, Christian minded, and controlling those who want to hurt American business. <br />- First of all, how dare you oppose Bush in not supporting of the glorious war and Crusade against non-Christian infidels? What's all this bull about WMDs? Saddam killed, so we killed, might makes right in any sensible mind. So all those who are against Bush are going to hell.<BR>- Democrats are all renegade swine, quite frankly, and it's a crying shame they are even allowed to vote. Jesus would have supported Bush in his war against muslim sheep and cutting funds for people who are disabled, crippled, retarded, old, etc. It's their own fault, Bush didn't make these losers the way they are.<BR>- So Bush didn't win the popular election; God wanted him to be President, God didn't trust the `popular majority' and God wanted a military hero like Bush in office. Thank God for our unbiased Supreme Court. <BR>- Furthermore, how dare you show narrow-minded animosity at Bush when he is a self made man. Don't believe those who say the US doesn't have enough jobs. If the Mexicans can find jobs, so can you. Republicans get better jobs because we know the game, know how to take advantage of the system, and because of our Godly contacts.<br />You should buy Anne Coulter books instead. She is the leading spokeswoman for the Republican party because she knows and speaks our truth.  Quotes from her:<BR>* \\"I think [women] should be armed but should not [be allowed to] vote...women have no capacity to understand how money is earned. They have a lot of ideas on how to spend it....it's always more money on education, more money on child care, more money on day care.\\"-- Politically Incorrect, 2/26/01<BR>* \\"...a cruise missile is more important than Head Start.\\"-- Speech, 11/01, rebroadcast by C-Span in Jan. 2002<BR>* \\"In his brief fiery ride across the landscape, Joe McCarthy bought America another thirty years. For this, he sacrificed his life, his reputation, his name. The left cut down a brave man, but not before the American people heard the truth.\\"-- The Drudge Report, quoting from Coulter's new book, Treason, 6/19/03<br />* \\"We hate them. Americans don't want to make Islamic fanatics love us. We want to make them die. There's nothing like horrendous physical pain to quell anger. A couple of well-aimed nuclear weapons will get our opposition out of the way.\\"-- Column, 9/25/02<BR>* \\"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity.\\"-- Column, 9/13/01 <BR>* \\"We need to execute people like John Walker in order to physically intimidate liberals, by making them realize that they can be killed, too. Otherwise, they will turn out to be outright traitors.\\"-- Speech to Conservative Political Action Conference, January 2002<br />* \\"Soldiers are just cowards with their backs against the wall. The lowest IQ men in our society, those incapable of normal careers enlist. Their choice in life; prison or the military. Some will have to die in the support of our cause.\\"-- Intervention Magazine, 11/06/03<BR>* \\"The only beef Enron employees have with top management is that management did not inform employees of the collapse in time to allow them to get in on the swindle.\\"-- Column, 1/24/02<BR>* \\"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to the New York Times Building.&quot;-- New York Observer interview, 8/20/02 <BR>* \\"Then there are the 39 million greedy geezers collecting Social Security. The greatest generation rewarded itself with a pretty big meal.\\"-- WorldNetDaily, 12/10/03<br />My hero is the Ex-House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, GOP presidential prospect, and architect of the Republican Party's failed impeachment of President Clinton. He only failed because Newt was having an affair. Who could blame Newt, his wife went and got sick with cancer. That was completely different from Clinton.<BR>Unlike Clinton, Newt was smart enough to divorce his wife after she got sick and could no longer drag him down with her.<br />Lastly, how dare you stumblingly expose your miscreant incompetence with rantings against the Patriot Act. In my mind<BR>Some Americans have too many Constitutional rights. The Bill of Rights should not even apply to the blue-collar middle classes who are too stupid to get involved. No Bush hating media or newspapers should have `freedom of the press,' since they only have their rights and freedoms because the rich allow them to have them. Ever see some poor slob or middle class idiot who owned a newspaper company? <br />You defamatory libelous, uneducated swine should keep your comments to yourselves or we'll send your job overseas.

When Franken is raking these and other Bushies over the coals (they don't deserve the name Conservative because they hold very few Conservative Principles any more, it's simply support Bush no matter what) it is pure bliss.  Towards the end of the book, though the book loses some steam.  <BR>Unfortunately, the people that NEED to read this book never will, they will continue  to obtain their &quot;NEWS&quot; from Hannity et al.

Written as a counter to books like &quot;Bias&quot; and &quot;Slander&quot; I think the humorus jabs at process rather then real argument on the claims reinforces the arguments of Goldberg and Coulter rather than debunks. Franken takes issue with Mrs. Coulters footnotes actually being endnotes, rather than engaging her arguments. Which is a shame, becasue I agreed with his premise, but he doesn't follow through. Mrs. Coulter does represent the hysterical right, but it is clear Franken represents the content free,but far more amusing left.<br />I give it three stars becasue it is funny.<br />Other recomendation on Media Bias I would suggest &quot;Amusing Ourselves to Death&quot; by Neil Postman. Postman puts forth no arguments on Bias, rather describes a battle for our attention spans that drives the media.	2004-03-05

I found this book to be a little too droning for my taste.  I liked Al's book on Rush Limbaugh.  And the first few chapters of this book concerning Fox News and Bill O'Reilly are enjoyable, but the later 2/3 of the book are just hard to read.  Al's shrill anti-conservative rant comes across as anything but fair and balanced.  Liberal inaccuracies and falsehoods are downplayed as everyone is human and can make mistakes, and who could remember those arcane statistics anyway.  While any minor mis-quote or inaccuracy on the part of a conservative is labelled as a LIE and a calculated campaign to discredit the left and deceive the American public.  I find it very hard to believe that every Democrat and every liberal is pure and altruistic while every Republican and conservative are an evil horde bent on the total destruction of mankind.  Give me a break.  There are very few books that I put down and never finish.  This was one of them.	2004-03-04

If you weren't expecting that to be the case before you read this book (if you did indeed read it), then I understand your outrage but cringe at your stupidity...<br />The unfortunate aspect of this book is that it is largely going to be a political symbol around or against which staunch supporters of either side are going to rally.  However, the real value in the book is not in what is being said, but the way in which Franken's case is made.  Whatever his politics, the method of actually providing examples, statistics, etc. that Franken employs puts him a cut above the name-calling tactics used by the \\"journalists\\" he takes to task.  I have a lot more respect for getting out a message in this way than in simply telling people what to fear and who's to blame for it (i.e. tax-loving Liberals).  Yes, Franken does also resort to name-calling, especially when it comes to Ann Coulter (though only after having discredited much of what she has said), but we shouldn't forget that this is intended to be a humorous piece, though not of the lowest-common-denominator type (sorry, one-star reviewers).<br />Being from Minnesota, I found Al Franken's chapter on Paul Wellstone's death and the subsequent memorial service to be both a moving tribute and a disturbing illustration.  Franken does a nice job of deconstructing the events that transformed one community's grief into a national political circus with widespread ramifications.  In the days and months after the memorial service, I even found myself feeling angry at how the Democrats \\"blew it\\" for the country with that event, but was stunned to learn through various accounts, including Franken's, about the distortions of truth that were enlisted by the Right for political gain.  Paul Wellstone is one of the purest examples in recent times of a public servant dedicated to helping all people, and to see how even his tragic death could not escape the grip of people with an evil agenda, while not necessarily a surprise, was an eye-opener.  \\"Fool me once...\\" wait, how does that go GW?<br />Above all, Franken makes me want to take action.  It will be interesting to see in the coming years if our country is shaped by leaders who are committed to helping their fellow citizens or by corporate puppets who distract the public by telling them what to fear next (now it's gay marriage) so that they can continue with business as usual.  If it's the latter then rest easy, one-star reviewers, because if that is really what you want then you can keep your country and I will gladly move away after my military service is up (that is, if I don't get picked off first in the terrorist training camp that we created by invading Iraq).	2004-03-04

Team Franken obviously went to painstaking efforts to ensure their accuracy, pre-empting a counter-attack from the right.  Before you demean his work and his credibility, at least check these facts on LexisNexis and Google as he suggests.<br />Whether you have a sense of humor and are able to laugh at a conservative pundit's mistake is your own issue.  Perhaps a therapist can help you with that.<br />Mr. Franken's book was funny and well-written.  The change of tone was a little inconsistent toward the end and read a little more like sketch comedy (as opposed to the real comedy of conservative pundits being caught in their own exaggerations), but I enjoyed the book entirely.  I'm glad he has the temerity to put his opinions unabashedly forward.<br />He's right.  It's about time we took back the word &quot;liberal&quot; and stopped the conservative right from making it sound as though it's a travesty to be in favor of civil and environmental rights, not to mention the truth.

But where would be without our democracy?

The book illustrates so many examples of blatant dishonesty by journalists and officials on the right. Franken is a clever writer and has uncovered a wealth of material to work with. He also had a team of student researchers and this was really evident in the detail and documentation he provided for his arguments.<br />One of my favorite bits was the discussion about a chart Hannity presented which showed the difference between Reagan's yearly budget and congressional spending. The chart had a number called &quot;cumulative difference&quot; which was listed as 24.5%, indicating what seems to be a big difference. In actuality the average yearly difference was (according to the chart) 3.1%. The number 24.5 was 3.1 multiplied by Reagan's 8 years in office!	2004-02-28

First off, I'm giving this book 5 stars, not because I think it necessarily earns all of them (I'd give it 4 stars, normally), but just to offset some of those people who don't actually write a review about a book, instead choosing to make themselves sound like third graders by calling names, and insisting on what a &quot;liar&quot; Mr. Franken is, just for being a liberal.  <br />Yes, this book definitely holds some left-wing bias, BUT it is absolutely infinitessimal in comparison to the type of bias that Rush Limbaugh, or Bill O'Reilly show on a daily basis.  Usually, Mr. Franken's bias only extends to being overly nitpicky about a few small things that some of these conservatives have wrong.  He doesn't blow them out of proportion, but gives them a little more space in the book than they're worth.  Besides, even WITH any sort of bias, he actually gives a reason for his beliefs, and backs it up with factual data to show you how he came to his conclusions.  <br />If the messenger is biased, at least the message isn't.<br />Also, please, if you're going to write a review about a book, try showing that you've read it instead of just throwing around insults at the author without pointing to any examples as to why you feel the way you do.	2004-02-27

There's no way you could walk into a Barnes and Noble and even hold that book for more than a minute, much less fork over your hard earned money.

Intelligent, insightful and with an acid wit, Franken tears apart the right-wing case for a liberal bias in the media, and proceeds to tear one by one into his critics in the right, exposing each for the fraud that they are.<br />Better still, he rips into the idea that the views of the left amount to 'hate-speak' or treason, and catalogues the vile bigotry, racism and general low-brow babble propagated daily by the right, with a little help from their media mogul buddies.<br />Franken does what the Bush administration and the right-wing media like to talk about but seem categorically incapable of: he 'changes the tone' and attempts to bring 21st century America into a place where responsible, high-tone political debate can flourish, and the real winner is the truth.  He combines perfectly the freedoms so fiercely guarded by the left with a sense of real responsibility to truth and a genuine concern for tomorrow and those who will inherit this earth from us.<br />The open-minded reader will gain a real sense of the political and media climate in the States at the moment, even as an outsider, and will see the hatred, bigotry and deception perpetrated by the right, in all its forms.  A must read for every responsible, concerned citizen out there.	2004-02-26

I found the book to be bitterly humorous, ironic, and sad. I am not a fan of Franken on SNL. I guess I'm too old for SNL retreads to amuse me--I remember better days. But there is significant substance in Franken's books.    By the way, the use of \\"left\\" and \\"right\\" in association with political parties comes from the location of seats in some European legislative buildings. And the words \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" don't connote anything terrible. Both approaches have validity and benefit, especially in concert. Protect and maintain the good things, for example our Constitution which assures our rights and protects our liberty. Discard what is destructive, such as slavery and withholding the right to vote.     Franken and many other observers of those currently in power, have persuasive evidence of wrong doing. The elected officials in our overtly Conservative government have clearly gone astray. They persist in promoting an administration which poses as conservative in order to foster radically self-serving and illegal activities. Congress, in giving away our constitutional rights, has been neither conservative nor liberal, but instead, astoundingly STUPID. The President, the Vice-president, and their elite gang, (cutesilly nick-named, the Vulcans by a President stuck in an immature cheer-leader phase) endlessly repeat their  stories, telling us WHAT to fear and WHO to blame, without proof, in order to scare Congress into giving away the rights of We the People. That is unconstitutional. There are way too many criminals, convicted and otherwise, running around the Bush White House. Franken is irreverant, sarcastic, and rude when stating his case. That does not, unfortunately, make him wrong.    What I can't understand is why haven't more Americans (and I include the members of the news media--they are not exempt from the demands of citizenship) asked WHAT Bush and his cronies get out of it, and WHO will get screwed by it? Dammit, I want my Constitutional rights!Wake up people. Our problem is not just an alien fanatic. The President lied, and continues to lie, in order to smother the rights of the free citizens of the United States of America. He dishonors his office and our country. It is our duty to go to the polls this fall and replace these chickenhawk lawless liars, along with the members of Congress who sold us out. Ours is a country of the people, by the people, and for the people, and it is up to us to maintain that trust as long as we live. The Bush administration sent our children away to needlessly die!

His elitist and partisan-typical liberal slant evoked in this book are the best evidence of his inability to reach the mainstream of the US.  His one-sided rants on the media, conservatives, the President, etc. are humorless and based on supposition and radical liberal theory.  His book is ugly, hateful, and worst of all, factless.  But give him some credit -- pander to the most radical of the left, make a few millions, then move on -- he may be a disgusting example of the worst of the far left (or far right for that matter) but he knows how to sell his sickness.  For comparison sake, he is as out of the mainstream on the left with the Al Gore's and Hillary Clinton's as Jerry Fallwell and Michael Savage are on the right.  If you want to read something that is based on evidence, fact, and research, read Hannity or Zell Miller.  I'll never stop being amazed that there are so many sheep out there who will follow such a hate-monger when there are Democrats and liberals out there who have class, can debate and speak with tact, and oh yeah, base their opinions on facts.  You'd never see such putrid trash from John Kennedy, the hero of heroes ofthe left (despite their refusal to admit that JFK was no liberal like his out of touch brother).  Don't buy this book, but for a laugh, borrow it so you know what you're up against with the Deans, Kerrys, and Ted Kennedys of the world.  Oh, by the way, so as not to seem like one of the sheep, I'm a proud pro-choicer & supporter of gay marriage - a Drudge-readin' small business & Patriot Act loving agnostic who would fight tooth and nail to lower taxes, fight terrorism just the way we are, and re-elect Bush.	2004-02-24

The book fails of its promise, which I took to be an objective de-bunking of some of the conservative populist media.  The style borders on being nauseating - I mean, how many times do we have to be reminded about his &quot;popular&quot; corporate speaking business?  Most of the criticism he levels against others applies to his own conduct as well, including rather childish name-calling and patently obvious fact distortions.  I mean come on; anyone with an IQ over 80 is not going to find much here that is either new, of interest, or compelling.  There are a few (and I mean a very few) funny bits, but you need to be into &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; humor.  If he could have left his ego out of the book, it would have been much shorter, but also much more readable.<br />This is a story that needs to be told, how misinformation is being paraded on major networks as truth.  If you hear a falsehood often enough, it become &quot;true&quot; in popular belief - how many times have you heard that the Great Wall of China is visible from space?  I just heard that long standing Chinese propaganda from the early 70s on CNBC again recently.  If people can repeat what &quot;they heard&quot;, then they don't need to think about what it is that they are saying.  A book needs to be written exploring the conservative movement's use of this tactic, but sadly it's not this book.	2004-02-23

Of course, he doen't realize that was too big a job even for Jesus Christ, he got himself crucified for it.<br />Franken, who is a bona fide Marxist, went and recruited several students from Harvard (Sin #1. Name-Dropping. I'm smart enough, & people like me, God Darn it) to \\"expose\\" those in the Government who either Don't Like Him, or Disagree with Him.  Trouble is, he's picked the guys who belive in his brand of politics with their own personal axes to grind or agendas to further. He never really backs up his argument with any other kind of facts other than the ones espoused by his party and their machine. The result? An uneven, boring and ultimatly libelous book (contrary to the title, which should garner him some lawsuits)with BIG print. I could not even bear to finish it.<br />Didn't his editor think to remind Franken he is an comedic actor, and a horrid one at that? He was a staff member on Saturday Night Live. Since when he make the conversion to America's #1 fact finder? That's the story I want to read. What University did Franken graduate from, what's his background? What about some anecdotal evidence to see why he is spitting his vitriolic venom at the Right? In short: Facts before Opinion.<br />I also find it interesting that Leftists like Franken are really pumping out titles and an unbelivable rate since Victory 2004.

But it's a little white lie. Since this sort of book always attracts dozens of 1 star reviews from &quot;reviewers&quot; who never bothered to read it, I thought I'd cut Al a little slack.<br />The style of humor here is the type we've grown to know and love, or know and hate, depending. That is to say, Franken imitates an over-the-top, foam-mouthed hurler of vile epithets, going so far overboard that no one (except his targets) could possibly take him seriously, meanwhile utterly failing to hide the pussycat within.<br />He does get seriously angry (and seriously unfunny) in only one chapter. He takes the matter personally because Paul Wellstone was a personal friend of Franken's (as he was of so many.)  It's the chapter detailing how the right wing successfully planted the meme that 20 seconds of endlessly played clips, pulled out of the four-hour memorial service for Paul Wellstone and the family and friends who went down with his plane, constituted proof that the whole event was a partisan hack job. That was, of course, a lie. Fox and friends found the only political 20 seconds of the evening, distributed them on endless tapeloop, ignored the three hours of tributes to the others who died, lied again about Republicans being &quot;booed off stage&quot; (there was a barely audible smattering of boos at a single point, when the camera picked up Trent Lott in the crowd - a clip that was never shown on the media, because the applause drowning out the boos would have contradicted the preferred lie of the moment), and got all the &quot;liberal&quot; media to echo their howls of indignation. Echoing was easier for CNN and the gang than sitting through four hours - or even ten minutes - of tape to learn what actually went on.<br />For the rest, Franken has five targets here: Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, each of whom is savaged mercilessly simply by juxtaposing a few of their blatant untruths side by side with the facts of the case. None of them are accorded any quarter, and none of them, shameless and basically nonstop prevaricators all, deserve any.  The other two faces at the center of the dartboard are corrected more gently: liar-in-chief George Bush, and the lazy &quot;Why check out a lie when you can just<BR>report it?&quot; media.<br />Yes, it's funny. Very little of it is laugh out loud funny, but it's at least up to Franken's usual standard of risibility. If you liked his other stuff, you'll like this every bit as well. He is not as entertaining (in the punch line per page sense anyway), nor as angry, as Michael Moore. He is, happily, every bit as unbalanced as that worthy. But he is considerably more fair. He documents everything he says, and like Santa checks it twice. Unless he can delegate the checking to his elves. Or as he himself assures us, &quot;Thanks to Team Franken, you can rest assured that almost every fact in this book is correct. Either that, or it's a joke.&quot;<br />If there's a difference between this and his earlier bestsellers, it's the quantity of good solid political ammunition it contains:  hard facts, hard quotes, lie after lie nailed to the wall and spread out like an entomological specimen for all the world to see. Though much of this ammunition is expended on already dead horses (the &quot;credibility&quot; of the Coulter O'Reilly Hannity triad), the rest is potentially handy. Once you've chuckled your way through the book, you might want to feed it to any friends who are suffering from information malnutrition thanks to Fox and the Fox wannabes.  They might just perk up far enough to take those TV IVs out of their arms.	2004-02-23

I think we can all agree that, before we set about our Democratic duties to have serious discussion and debate, we need to have the facts straight when it comes to our country ant the policies that effect it.<br />Like him or not, Al Franken discusses the serious lies and mis-representations in the conservative media. &quot;Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; is a polemic, confrontational book, as are the various anecdotes Al writes about, confronting various Conservative pundits, reporters, and politicians. But, this book isn't about style - it's about facts. And the fact of the matter is, Franken has the facts right. <br />I personally found the book hilarious - I'm sure many readers will find it crude and offensive. But still, if you really call yourself a patriot, you will know that those who love this country will not be swayed by honey lies. We will find the truth. And, whether it's on Limbaugh's shows or in Franken's book, we all have a duty to search.<br />This is an excelent book, a must read. 5 stars.	2004-02-22

Here he parses the sentences made by the fair right and other monsters to point up their lies, half-lies, innuendoes, quotations out of context ad nauseam. Mr. Franken lists his sources and backs his statements up with references in the back of the book, not that that means anything to his critics. Thank you, Mr. Franken, for reminding us once again of the many good things that President Clinton did for America. That information alone would make the book worth reading.<br />There are lots of funny things here - \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" in which Lieutenant John Kerry's Vietnam troops consist of George W. Bush, who is usually a little tipsy; Dick Cheney, who in the heat of combat has a heart attack; Clarence Thomas who is into pornography, along with John Ashcroft, Bill O'Reilly, Phil Gramm and Rush Limbaugh. In the midst of this gaggle, Al Gore comes to to an article on Kerry. Delicious. Then there's the \\"No Child Left Behind Standardized Test\\" and the list of people-- Ashcroft, Ralph Reed, Phyllis Schlafly, Condoleezza Rice, the Cheneys, Pat Robertson et al-- whom Franken writes to get their personal abstinence stories. Then some of the scary stuff: I found it incredible when it happened and Franken reminded me that Max Cleland in the 2000 election was portrayed as \\"unpatriotic\\" by his opponent. This is a man who lost three limbs while serving in Vietnam. That that lie stuck and probably cost Cleland the election is scary beyond belief. Don't forget Jerry Falwell's statement on 9/13/01: \\"I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way--all of them who have tried to secularize America--I point the finger in their face, and say, 'you helped this happen'.\\" Well, the right Reverend Falwell forgot the little old ladies who play bingo on Wednesday nights. They are really what's sending this nation to hell in a wheelbarrow. But this book ultimately will make you sad, sad that we lost most of the world's  goodwill we gained after 9/11/01, sad that there is no civility left in government and politics. (I recently heard a taped conversation between President Kennedy and President Eisenhower in which Kennedy was asking Eisenhower's advice on what to do about an international crisis. There was respect and cordiality on both ends of the telephone. I don't believe that would happen in Washington today.) I was saddened that Paul Wellstone's memorial service in the hands of the right wingers became a \\"political rally\\" for Democrats.<br />My one problem with this book is that Mr. Frankel is so good that sometimes I cannot tell if he is joking or not. For example, did John Ashcroft actually annoint himself with oil before being sworn in for public office in Missouri?e really what's sending this nation to hell in a wheelbarrow.

But, after reading &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot etc.&quot;, I was quite impressed.  This man is smart enough to be REALLY funny, while insightful at the same time.<br />I also have to admit I'm skeptical of any book that has a chapter titled &quot;Ann Coulter:  Nutcase&quot;.  But, after you read a few pages, you realize that it's a fairly accurate description of her.<br />This is a well-researched, insightful, and EXTREMELY funny book.  By far, my favorite chapter is the story of the Paul Wellstone memorial service, which is poignant enough to make you melancholy, but interspersed with enough humor to make it not a complete tear-jerker.<br />Of course, a book like this has sparked a storm of criticism from conservatives (the most obviouse evidence of this is some of the reader reviews on this page!), a storm of counter-criticism from fans (again, refer to other reviews), numerous websites attacking or defending it, and even a lawsuit from Fox News Channel. I have to believe, after reading the book, that that was sparked by Bill O'Reilly, angry over the HORRIBLE looking picture of him on the cover!  Needless to say, the suit was laughed out of court.  I'm sure Franken will have something to say about it when the paperback version comes out.<br />All of this controversy has no doubt helped sales of the book tremendously.

However, this book is well written and as a republican I felt it was necessary to at least mention this to be fair.  It seems that almost all reviewers here are either faithful democrats or staunch republicans and incapable of fair reviews.  This is illustrated by all of the 1 star reviews and all of the 5 star reviews.  <br />Seemingly, Mr. Franken has written a well researched book.  Sadly, how do we know if this is 100% true or not?  Do you actually read and research the footnotes in each chapter.  It's my opinion that after 9/11 this country has pulled even further apart. There seem to be no independent thinkers but rather partisan ideologues that continue to divide this country at its most crucial point in its young history.  People like Al, Hannity, Coulter, etc. are unfortunately polarizing the masses.  Truth be told there are a lot of not too smart people in the U.S.  I'm amazed at all of the people that get there news from the aforementioned people whether on t.v. or book and don't check the facts but simply believe the self-serving and partisan rhetoric spewing from the mouths of today's leaders in journalism, politics, etc.  It seems everyone has a motive today and few think of the Country first.<br />Read this book if for nothing else for the humor.	2004-02-19

They at least believe in the equality of all and live by those principles. North Korea may not be practical some of the time and maybe some unbridled individuals must be sacrificed for the common good, but North Korea sure is moral! I also think they have a right to have nuclear weapons and even use them if Bush and his cronies threaten them. <br />Here's another lie! Conservatives try to say that environmentalists have caused a holocaust by banning DDT and letting millions die of malaria which DDT almost wiped out. Rubbish! The number is no where near millions.

This book is considerably more scrupulously fact-checked than several on the opposite side of the aisle, most specifically those by Hannity and Coulter (Good lord!

My problem wasn't with the factual (which I checked on Nexis/Lexis;  pretty much every quote was verbatim and the facts check out).<br />While I realize Al Franken's job is to entertain, I wasn't fond of some of the tone of voice.  I think Joe Conason's book was a bit...well...classier.  Yes, he's a comedian.  Still, the opposition is so meanspirited and ugly that I find I'm particularly critical of that type of tone of voice.<br />That said, I do not give four stars lightly.

One of the most telling anecdotes is that of Dick Cheney, who has to pretend to have a sense of awe and patriotism when referring to Arlington National Cemetery, when he didn't have a clue as to what markers are placed over the graves.  What a phony.  This should not be dismissed as a Liberal/Conservative tome; it is an honest look at people in public life who are trying to grab attention through an undeserved podium.

The content is very serious of course, which is why I cannot read more than one book consecutively about the Bush regime, but Franken's wit makes it more enjoyable than the usual Bush indictments.

This book is wonderful at pointing out the lies that are perpetrated by ultra-conservatives like Ann Coulter. A conservative friend once asked me what the difference was between liberals like Franken (and myself) and conservatives when it comes to their views on politics. The difference is that liberals tend to back their assertions with cold, hard, easy-to-verify sources. Conservatives can only back up their assertions by quoting other conservatives or by distorting the facts by quoting things out of context. Everything that Franken says in this book is easy to verify in numerous sources if you take the time to do a little research.<br />Franken is quite witty, but I tend to like Michael Moore's style a little better. Moore is a little more down to Earth and, though the conservatives will never believe it, Moore is a bit more balanced in his criticism (he criticizes Clinton just as sharply as Bush at times, for example).<br />Franken makes lots of good points but, unfortunately, the people who need to KNOW this stuff won't read the book or they will read it with a closed mind. <br />Conservatives--do yourself and your country a favor. Read this book, verify the sources, and balance your views. Only by seeing both sides and acknowledging the truth can this country get back on its collective feet.	2004-02-11

With \\"Lies and the Liars Who Tell Them,\\" Mr. Franken and  \\"TeamFranken\\" have essentially given readers a mind-awakening tool just like Roddy's ghoul-detecting sunglasses! <br />This intelligently-written, insightful, well-researched, and fact-based book exposes the shrill propagandistic offal spewing from the media's and government's rich conservatives.    <br />And although the book is speckled throughout with a good dose of laugh-out-loud humor, it is mainly a sobering exposé of our country's takeover by the wealthiest 1 percent of our population and their malevolent intertwining of capitalism and fascism; <br />their turning a blind eye to white collar crime and stockholder ripoffs while angrily shaking their fingers at drug users and welfare recipients;  <br />their focus on \\"moral\\" issues so they can divert our attention from the common person's economic woes and lack of health care;   <br />and their evangelical support of George W.'s blind determination to \\"finish\\" his dad's war.<br />The stories about Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Hannity and Colmes are side-splitting.  The chapters on Karl Rove and Republican machinations and newspeak are frightening.  And the chapter on the Bush Administration's trashing of Clinton's national security programs before September 11 is truly horrifying.    <br />Although most of the book is a delightful, fact-based, and well-deserved skewering of conservatives, Mr. Franken bravely does admit times he has been wrong, such as his attempt to get dirt on Bob Jones University.  And the book is not perfect, as it includes a few stories which undermine TeamFranken's brilliance, such as the nasty, trivial, and rude confrontation of Mrs. Barbara Bush.  <br />This book is a MUST READ for every American.<br />It is also a MUST READ for people who live outside the USA and are fearfully watching the Earth's giant bully its way around the planet.	2004-02-11

Carville's gets very specific in his recommendations about what he is FOR (not just what he is against)--which is refreshing and helpful.<br />Franken's book is funnier and goes into more depth about the hypocrisy and mendacity and cruelty and elitism that are the Bush Administration.  That is, it's more about what he is against.<br />But who could reasonably NOT be against such things.  Even Bush pretends to be, which is why he has to lie so much.<br />Two of the very short chapters are brilliant and priceless.  Franken sent an Abstinence Endorsement letter out to the bigwigs in the Administration--Ashcroft, Rice, Wolfowitz, Cheney, Bush, etc.--and asked them to send back personal accounts of how they maintained sexual abstinence and how they profited by it.  None of them wrote back--presumably because they didn't practice it.<br />The other is \\"Supply Side Jesus,\\" which captures in nice, Chick Comic style, the hypocrisy of Bush's Pharisees, who believe that Jesus was for the rich and against everyone else.<br />A great and funny and illuminating book.<br />Franken is even honest enough to admit HE was deceived by Bush's lies about Iraq and at first supported the invasion.<br />This is his main point: Bush lies because lies work.	2004-02-11

Franken's book contains one small error.

Possessing little, and coming from a disadvantaged background to which Mr. Franken sometimes refers, he has through creativity and energy tapped into a lucrative reader market and vaulted into the thin ranks of best-selling authors.  His work -- his lonely work as a creative writer, his initiative as a commentator -- has produced for him a fortune, and he may now proudly consider himself a successful rich American.  His toil has made him wealthy beyond the dreams of most of us, and rightfully so -- Mr. Franken fully deserves every penny of the funds that people have paid voluntarily for access to his humor and commentary.  Mr. Franken never begged, or complained to the government or demanded any sort of subsidy or bail-out -- rather, he got to work, found a market for his abilities, took charge of his own life, became self-reliant, and grew very wealthy.  Everyone in our nation should emulate this concept, and do as Mr. Franken did:  Get to work for yourself, produce something legal/honorable that other people like, and reap the profits therefrom.  Congratulations, Mr. Franken:  It is the motivated individuals like YOU who prove that American-style, free-market, profit-seeking, laissez-faire capitalism is the greatest economic system ever devised by humans.  While Al Franken doesn't preach it, he definitely LIVES it.	2004-02-09

I've read both this book and &quot;Treason&quot; and all I can say is that I was able to get past the first chapter in this book without wondering aloud, &quot;what is your point?!&quot;.<br />There is a bit too much profanity in this for my taste.  I guess Mr. Frankin wanted to witness to his ire or add shock value.  He did not succeed in either case, I don't beleive.  <br />Still, with Mr. Franken's &quot;psycho&quot; personality (walking up to people and asking them pointed questions, rather than the softball stuff they get on talking head shows) he does hit some obvious vulnerable spots of the Right - particularly their self imposed &quot;moral authority&quot;.  Mr. Franken, rightly proves, that they have neither the morals they claim, nor any type of real leadership/authority (as the Iraq bumbling has once again proven).  The Right is made up, primarily, of blustering empty suits who do just as many underhanded things as the Left (if not more) all the while saying all the culturally PC things that their side wants to hear (and believe about them).  The list, for instance, of Rightwingers who have cheated on thier spouses is every bit as long as the Left's - yet the Christian Right continues to support AND FORGIVE them, but not their counterparts.  This book clearly points out the hypocrisy in that very action - the ability to forgive one on your side but deamonize, ala Coulter and Rush Got-any-Drugs Limbaugh, others who disagree with you.  Rush's hypocrisy is not on display here, but with Rush, as with most Republicans, it is only a matter of giving them enough rope/power.	2004-02-09

The right talks about growth but is not doing anything as large corporations are systematically migrating jobs offshore. The Bush Administration does not even have a plan for dealing with this offshore onslaught on the American Worker. <br />After reading Franken, I read this new book titled:  Offshore Outsourcing by Marcia Robinson and Ravi Kalakota.  <BR>  <BR>I was amazed to learn that over 70% of Fortune 500 corporations are adopting this practice and moving very high quality jobs overseas.  And the strategy they are using is not outsourcing but building their own captive centers in places like India and the Phillipines.  The captive center, basically their own subsidiary, gives them a platform as well as significant tax advantages.<br />There was a detailed case study on GE that was illuminating. According to this book GE has over 20,000 employees in India performing back-office activities for all the different business units. Another case study on American Express illustrates a similar captive center model. This is an alarming trend. <br />Assuming that India, China and the Philippines and Russia grow by 2M jobs every year, that means that U.S and Europe where the bulk of offshore outsourcing is happening are   going to suffer 2M job losses. That scenario means an increase in unemployment of .75 to 1% per year in the U.S alone in the next three to five years. This will be catastrophic to the standard of living if this scenario plays out.<br />I am only scratching the surface of what this book talks about. I suggest this book [offshore outsourcing by Robinson and Kalakota] for everyone who wants a better understanding of what's taking place. <br />Fair and Balanced policies against offshore outsourcing. That's what we need.	2004-02-07

When Bill O'Reilly claims on his radio show that he &quot;never said&quot; something, and that you cannot find a transcript where he said that very thing, and then Al Franken points out 3 actual transcripts where he said that thing, I simultaneously laughed out loud at what an incredible hypocrite he was and felt incredibly depressed at how influential and well respected O'Reilly is. That experience is indicative of the book as a whole: it used actual evidence, something &quot;nuts&quot; such as O'Reilly and Ann Coulter apparently haven't heard of; it was extremely funny and enjoyable to read about; and, the more I thought about, the more I was scared about not just the condition of the media in this country, but, more importantly, the flaws of the current administration as well as partisan politics as a whole in America.<BR>By the way, for those of you who attack this book simply because it is unabashedly liberal without having read the book and/or realizing that cold hard facts cannot be argued with, please don't bother to print your &quot;review.&quot; If you disagree with Mr. Franken, find a conservative-biased book with equally irrefutable evidence to support its opinions, and point to it.

Bush and Karl Rove. (I severly disliked both of them before and now can move towards the hatred mark of the scale.)<BR>Franken's wit is flat out hilarious and there were moments when I had so much trouble stifling my laughter, I had friends asking if I needed help. &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot; is one of the most memorable chapters I read which had me literally in tears.  The chapters on Ann Coulter made me realize, yet again, what a bumbling idiot she really is.  Plus, the chapter on Paul Wellstone was inspiring and reminded me just why I love politics and made me want to get even more involved in public service.<BR>As a self-professed bleeding liberal raised in a family of card carrying conservatives, Franken infuses his work with wit and poses significant questions regarding the current president and his cabinet.  This book confirmed my belief that the right truly is wrong.	2004-02-05

Using humor (sorely lacking from the anger, hate filled right), and facts (also in short supply from the Republican side), Mr. Franken exposes the lies and the liars that abound in our country, starting with the Chief Liar himself, Bush. Who knew that Clinton gave &quot;greater priority to terrorism than any president before him&quot;, and that the Republicans fought him every step of the way? We do now! Hopefully this book will inspire and educate enough people out there to throw out the illegitimate president we have now come November.	2004-02-04

I picked up &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot; off the discount shelf and started reading.  I could not put it down.  I ended up having to buy it, so I could continue to read it home.<br />I am of a liberal thought, so I was, I suppose, already agreeing with most of what Al had to say in the book.  However, the book does provide a breath of fresh air.  Unlike the tons of literature written by the right-wing talking heads, this book is using factual and well documented material.  Franken holds no holes barred.  He sticks it to the right wing, yet, he can back up his satire with hard proof.<br />Not only is his book a collection of exposed right-wing lies, it is unbelievably funny and easy to read.  His satire is powerful, yet there is some feel of Saturday Night Life on it.<br />Franken is definitely not an angel.  He is combative, as he himself admits, and he is not against playing pranks on his favorite right-wing targets.  These targets respond with more lies and the reader gets to laugh more.<br />The book definitely works for me.	2004-02-03

My Southern neighbors routinely vote against their own economic interests because the right cynically appeals to their prejudices, among other things.  Then others down here are taken in by the right's shameless appeal that they (and they only) represent God in this great country. Franken explodes this nonsense by exposing the moral bankruptcy of the Right. He shows that no scurrilous attack, blatant lie, or illegal act is beneath these usurpers.  I truly fear for my country if Bush and his ilk are allowed to rule this country for much longer. I can only hope that the Democratic nominee (whoever he turns out to be) wins the Presidential election by such a large margin that there is not an opportunity for the Right to steal another one.	2004-02-03

For me, as a universitystudent from Sweden, i have seen how the usa are represented in two ways. In one way, USA is the land of popular culture, alternative lifstyles and freedom. In another way, USA is the country that is ruled by right-wing warlovers thats only concerned about making money, often paid by thousands of innocents lives, and spreading right-wing christianity much like the old english crusades. &quot;The Lies...&quot; got me worried. I have always wanted to live in the USA. Im not sure that I want that anymore. If theese lying liars countinues to represent this country, usa will soon have no friends left (and everybody is happier with friends) But Al Franken also makes me hopfull about the future. Maybe one day the power is taken away from the right-wing ultra conservatives and given to the liberal peaceloving people. If so the USA can be the country that the whole world (or at least Sweden) wants to love. A great book by Al Franken! And by the way, go kerry!	2004-02-03

So the first thing a lot of people point out the obvious; Al Franken is a humorist.  That does give him a little bit of latitude to be cutting in some of his remarks (though he accuses no one of high crimes and misdemeanors based on manipulated research and conjecture, like some Coulters we know).  What it also does, is help make this book very funny.  What it does not do is take away any of the legitimacy of the well-researched facts he points out, nor does it lessen the impact of the eye-roll inducing stories.<br />But it is more than funny.  One way or another, this book will invoke some anger.  If you are inclined toward the right-dominated media, you'll quickly affect annoyance and dismiss this book.  If you are inclined to believe what is true, and you don't mind a few slaps at icons of the right, you'll enjoy Franken's book, but will seethe at revelations of media manipulation and outright lies by the right.  <br />In the end, Franken is no mystery - so you probably have a pretty good idea of whether or not you'll like this book.

Interestingly, the law suit brought by Fox News against this book, for violating trademark by using the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" in the title, was judged \\"wholly without merit\\" by a judge. Al Franken said, in response, that Fox News should change its slogan to reflect that ruling: \\"Fox News: Wholly without merit.\\"<br /><br />Franken's book makes a case for such a judgement. His convincingly researched volume is the product of his service as a fellow at Harvard's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy. In this capacity, he led Harvard students, \\"TeamFranken\\" in researching deliberate and ignorant mistruths promulgated by conservatives in the United States political process.<br /><br />Obviously, Franken has a decided political position, and one has to take his assessment of the \\"truth\\" with a grain of salt, as one should of anything firmly planted inside an ideology. There were times, specifically the \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode 1\\" chapter, that I felt that Franken was perpetrating the wrongs that he has accused the \\"other side\\" of committing, and I didn't enjoy it. But for the most part, I laughed, was outraged and felt confident with his research.<br /><br />Franken starts out and continues throughout the book addressing the idea that mainstream media leans to the left of the political spectrum. He notes instances in which general source media (network television and newspapers, like the New York Times) picked up what he believes to be right-wing reaction or language and promulgated it as accepted news. Two of these sitatutions were the Al Gore Exaggeration Story and the It Was Not a Memorial Service (for Paul Wellstone).<br />TeamFranken explicates the history of the universally accepted truth that Al Gore lies and exaggerates his own accomplishments. For example, Gore said, \\"During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet,\\" referring to his efforts in Congress to help fund the Internet's forerunner, a military computer network called Arpanet. \\"What he seemed to be doing is what members of Congress do: He was taking credit for a program he championed and funded. In this case, one that revolutionized the information infrastructure of the entire world,\\" writes Franken. Al Gore was also falsely accused of claiming that he and Tipper were the inspiration for the characters in LOVE STORY, Oliver Barrett and Jenny Cavalleri. What actually happened was that a newspaper in Tennessee had misquoted the author of LOVE STORY, Erich Segal, as saying the above story (Segal had actually stated that Oliver Barrett was based partially on Al Gore and partly on Tommy Lee Jones, his college roommate, but not that Tipper had a part in it.) Gore, having read the article in his home state paper, told another reporter that that was what he had read, not that he was the inspiration. Another instance included the New York Times and the Washington Post misquoting Gore saying that he had been the one who started it all, in terms of the investigation of Love Canal, when what he had said was \\"That was the one that started it all,\\" referring to a toxic waste dump in Tennessee that a little girl had written to his Congressional office about. Though the NYTimes and the Post issued corrections, the story took hold and furthered the idea of Gore as a congenital exaggerator (if I may be inspired by Safire here).<br /><br />The issue of the Wellstone Memorial is similar. Franken, who attended the service, said that Wellstone's friend, in his speech, went over the top and was inappropriate in calling for everyone -- including Republicans present at the event -- to vote for Mondale, but that previous to that many heartfelt speeches were made, one for each casualty of the plane crash that killed Wellstone, his wife, other family members and staffers. But by the time the story had moved through the \\"filtering\\" of theright wing, it grew maintstream media legs for the accusation that the mourners were \\"plants\\" \\"shuttled in,\\" that Trent Lott was booed off the stage (he never spoke, and smiled good naturedly at some teasing boos from a small contingent of people in the stands when he entered, sayeth Franken), and that they whole thing was conceived and planned as a political move against Wellstone's opponent, Coleman (who won).<br /><br />I won't list all the examples in the book, but wanted to present an idea of what is written in the volume and how Franken addresses what he decries as lowering the tone of discourse in politics in America, for which he holds entities like Fox News and people like Ann Coulter responsible. He seeks to shoot down right-wing propaganda and parses data released by the White House in furtherance of its policies, with which he disagrees, to show vastly different results.<br /><br />The writing is funny, and I laughed out loud often while reading LIES. Some chapter titles include: Who Created the Tone?, Did the Tone Change? Why Did Anyone Think it Would Change? and I Grow Discouraged about the Tone. He includes information about tax cuts and cuts to state funding in a witty play, and even includes a funny cartoon, \\"Supply Side Jesus,\\" for which he gives credit for the idea to Bradley Whitford (yes, that Bradley Whitford, from WEST WING). He does a hysterical typographical number on Colmes's name whenever he mentions the Fox News show Hannity and Colmes, in which Colmes is supposed to represent the Left -- it made me laugh every single time I saw it.<br /><br />Franken saves his deepest vitriol for George Bush, Dick Cheney, Ann Coulter and Karl Rove, not only showing another side to their presentation of policy and events, but also refuting the effectiveness of the administration's policies in humorous and convincing prose.<br /><br />Franken succeeds here at making political and policy knowledge and issues entertaining, in a substantive way. He is deeply offended by what he feels is a degrading effect on political discourse in this country by some of the right-wing's most powerful people and its pundits to win at any cost. This book is a vital part of the public discourse on politics and the state of the nation, whether one agrees or not, because it presents another side to accepted truths about our country.it grew maintstream media legs for the accusation that the mourners were \\"plants\\" \\"shuttled in,\\" that Trent Lott was booed off the stage (he never spoke, and smiled good naturedly at some teasing boos from a small contingent of people in the stands when he entered, sayeth Franken), and that they whole thing was conceived and planned as a political move against Wellstone's opponent, Coleman (who won). <BR> <BR>I won't list all the examples in the book, but wanted to present an idea of what is written in the volume and how Franken addresses what he decries as lowering the tone of discourse in politics in America, for which he holds entities like Fox News and people like Ann Coulter responsible.

(It appears Mr. Franken has something hard against the Irish.  Perhaps he should spend a few days in Belfast commiserating with Rev. Paisley or others of similar ilk for his next thoughtful tome). <br />Make no mistake about it, Franken can be a funny guy. Some of his yarns ring true. Others, such as Helen Thomas' alleged mauling by a Bush staffer, have already proven to be apocryphal. But throughout the book, the self-applied veneer of \\"satirist\\" wears thin, revealing again and again the invidious hue of an angry, partisan bully much like (dare I say?) his rotund radio nemesis.<br />One can hardly wait for Franken's next enlightening work.  Perhaps \\"Barbara Bush Has A Fat Ass\\" would be a fetchcing title. If, in the meantime, should some right wing bore come out with a similarly titled work on Hillary's derrier, Franken could regale us with another lecture on the sad state of our political discourse.<br />In Franken's solipsistic world view, the ranting of Limbaugh et al is insidious, the ranting of Franken is satire.	2004-01-28

I think I laughed more while reading this book than I have at the last ten years of Saturday Night Live. Al franken is what Rush Limbaugh wishes he was: witty, well researched, intelligent...How come none of the Democrats are man enough to stand up against this Troglodyte we have in the white house? It takes books like this one to Shed some light on what is really going in this country. How did we go from the most prosperous time in our country to where we are now so quickly? Read this book and find out. This is one of the best books I have read in recent years. Unless you believe everything President Shrub and Rush limbaugh tell you you may still have a chance to break away form the undertow this administration is throwing us into. READ IT!!!	2004-01-28

It's been difficult to be a liberal for the last, oh, couple of decades.  I used to think Ronald Reagan was bad, until George W. came along with his experienced team of grey-haired criminals.  Many is the time I've seethed as right-wing extremists like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter (aka Nutcase) criticized liberals at the same time they've coarsened public discourse, impeached a president, denied citizens the vote and stolen an election.  Then we're told we should &quot;get over it&quot;.  That Tom Delay and Dick Cheney love this country more than we do.  Well, I'm not over it, and Delay and Cheney and Rove don't know what this country is about, and it is absolutely lovely to hear someone (a) point these things out, (b) refute the BS with research and facts, and (c) do so with a laugh.<br />With chapters on Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, the Wellstone memorial service, the military, abstinence, tax relief, pig feces and Barbara Bush, this is a terrific mix of comedy and savage ridicule.  This is less detailed than recent books criticizing the administration (eg Joe Conason's Big Lies) but also more accessible -- a great gift for your conservative relations before the upcoming election.<br />I hope this is the beginning of a moderate and liberal movement to take back our country, and I hope the next president will appoint Al Franken Secretary of Information (and Ralph Nader to clean up corporate crime and Al Gore Secretary of the Interior) -- hey, a liberal can dream!	2004-01-27

After a few years, he left the show to make movies, featuring characters he recycled from the show. <br />When this charade ground to a halt due to total indifference from the ticket-buying public, he carved out a new and unique niche for himself as the ultra-liberal alternative to the wildly successful conservative commentators. The key difference being that millions of people listen every day to Limbaugh, O'Reilley, and Hannity, while Franken gets gigs speaking to the Des Moines Rotary Club and the National Association of Slaughterhouse Executives. At least Franken gets the occasional 3am appearance on C-SPAN, and is doing better than America's other liberal know-it-alls, Michael Dukakis, Mario Cuomo and Al Gore, who haven't left home in years except to pick up supplies at Walmart and to run the Buick through the carwash.<br />Having failed at TV, movies, public appearances, and numerous other ventures over the last thirty years, Franken turned to books. He is a reasonably good writer and like his earlier political book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, this is a funny, well-researched, though generally disorganized book. It is well stocked with funny bits, weird adventures, and chapters guaranteed to insult everyone, such as Supply-Side Jesus and Operation Chickenhawk. Even as a conservative, I agree that certain conservatives, such as Phil Gramm, Spiro Agnew, Strom Thurmond, and Dan Quayle are begging to be satirized.<br />Unfortunately for Franken, he has elected to take on the herculean and unwinnable task of disproving the arguments of very popular conservatives. When he shows them to be wrong now and then, one can easily dismiss him by pointing out that he has now shown his adversary to be 99.9% correct. <br />I dont see how therepublic is endangered by O'Reilley claiming to be from a lower-middle class Long Island neighborhood, instead of an upper-middle class Long Island neighborhood, especially since I have never been to either. Like most women that I know, the fabulous looking Anne Coulter lies about her age. Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh clearly don't understand statistical analysis or mathematics, but I doubt other radio personalities do either. <br />In other cases, Franken takes on politicians with mixed results. He obsesses about Bush's claim that the tax cut will primarily aid the lower income bracket. This is either true or false, depending on your assumptions, point of view, and definitions. To be clearer, the President should have said that the majority of people getting tax cuts will have income below a certain level. Or he could have said that low-income folks will get a larger percentage reduction in federal income tax. Both of these are probably true (I dont really claim to be a tax expert), and clearer than what he did say, although maybe that is what he meant. Unlike FDR and JFK, the Bushes are not known for clarity and exactitude of speech. <br />Read the book to see what the other side is thinking and also, find a few holes in our guys' arguments. Franken is best in his comedic trips and encounters, such as the admissions trip to Bob Jones University, the backstage argument with O'Reilley about use of splotchy photos on the book jacket, and the chance encounter with a former first lady.	2004-01-27

Franken's work is pure satirical brilliance and while \\"Lies\\" remains as clever as its predecessor, the hilarious \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot,\\" it also shines a light on some very serious subjects. Despite constant attacks from the right, Franken continues to fight on his terms, armed with humor and the truth (and sources to prove it... note to Ann Coulter). <br />His dissection of the right and its malicious influence over the media is levelheaded and so thoroughly researched that it cannot be dismissed with mere O'Reilly-esque invective. Among the hysterical rants and shameless personal attacks on Franken's appearance and intellect by rabid right-wingers who have no respect for the truth or civil dialogue found throughout these reviews, I have yet to see a single coherent objection to his conclusions.  Nevertheless, THANK YOU for so unwittingly illustrating the books entire message that neo-con fanatics can always be counted on to miss the point entirely, while remaining utterly humorless and ignoring all facts. <br />The most valuable lesson learned by reading \\"Lies\\" is that one must never take anything written or spoken in the mainstream media (or in Amazon's reader reviews) at face value. The conservative propagandists have disgraced the first amendment by using it as justification for their ruthless, stop-at-nothing smear campaigns. Sadly, this book reinforces the belief that the radical conservatives currently occupying the White House and news desks across the country, and their sycophantic minions are deceitful, spiteful hate-mongers, who have no morals and lack the slightest hint of integrity.	2004-01-26

If ever a book was a collection of vastly misrepresented facts surrounded by some witty sarcasm whose sole purpose was to distract readers from the truth, this book is it.  Franken's questionable research and truely dispicable view of people not just on the right, but also in the center of political ideaology are offensive at best and libelous at worst.  <br />Why is it, that for all of the intelectual elitism on display by Franken (and other leftists), all attacks switch from being based on fact and instead become personal.  Almost all of his opponents (O'Reilly, Coulter, Hannity, etc) seem to go out of their way to avoid personal name calling and ridicule.  My sense is that because the facts speak for themselves, personal attacks are not even needed.  Reading books from intelectual elitist like Franken only strengthen my view that they will never be in touch with the problems faced in today's real world, and will instead, attempt to distract us from their true feelings, by personal attack and witty banter.<br />While I regret that I cannot have back the hours it took me to read this book, it only reinforces my view that the left are a bunch of immoral, elitist, snobs who thumb their nose at the everyday person and couldn't give a darn about how the majority truely lives their lives.<br />I would suggest this book as a read for anyone who just finished their MAD magazine	2004-01-26

The trip to Bob Jones University was hilarious!  Many of those reviewers who disliked the book were very shrill and, occasionally, downright cruel.

I had to pleasure of reading Mr. Franken's book and mostly enjoyed it.  He will not get the Pulitzer, but he has gotten America to listen to another side.<br />After being bombarded with &quot;CNN bad&quot;, &quot;NPR bad&quot;, &quot;all media, except for FOX News, bad&quot; the American public is finally listening to somebody saying &quot;FOX News bad&quot;.  I am now thoroughly convinced that all media is biased (prove to me that it is not) and it is all the more important for all to make up their own mind, not to believe channels that say they are are &quot;balanced&quot;, only because they are.  Mr. Franken's book is as &quot;balanced&quot; as FOX News is.<br />It seems to me that ever since Clinton was elected, or more importatnly lied to America about a relatively trivial thing, the right has felt a sense of righteousness.  This has only resulted in the election of a president that is farther from center than Clinton ever was.  And the result, the hate for and lies being told by the for Bush and the current administration are much stronger than those regarding the Clinton administration.<br />I hope America stops this back and forth, as it is very destructive.  But in the meantime, Mr. Franken gives the left a lot of valid ammo (nobody has shown me the lies in his book) to volley at the right.	2004-01-25

There is generally not a shred of evidence in many of these so-called &quot;reviews&quot; that go on to attack Al's religion, patriotism, looks, family, etc.<br />Having read the book, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am troubled by almost everything about the current administration, and can do little but wait until the next election.  I was concerned that the book would enrage me even more.  Al has a unique way of tempering the outrage with a touch of humanity and humor.  <br />Franken's discussions of Clinton's military, foreign policy, and terrorism policies were most enlightening- and these issues are almost never intelligently discussed in the media.  <br />The rest of the book largely preaches to the choir, and undoubtedly will go over the heads of any self-described neo-con.  Why neo-cons are so opposed to critically viewing their own political beliefs is beyond me, and why they use Amazon book reviews to spew their garbage over something they have never read is even more strange.  <br />I hope Franken can find a voice in the wilderness of hate-filled right-wing talks shows (on talk radio, fox news, the op-ed pages).

I love the fact that he takes to task the people who are running the country and those who think they should be.  This is the literary equivalent of &quot;pants-ing&quot; George dub-ya, his cronies, and all his wannabes that enable him to lie and get away with it.  And I say good for Al!  Should it be read with a grain of salt?  SURE, every political commentary carries that warning, but should it be considered garbage because he brings to light the conservatives ugly dust-bunnies that have been shoved under the rug?  No.  The best thing about this book is that it forces the reader to ask, &quot;Is this REALLY what's going on?&quot;  It motivates the intelligent reader to become informed, to seek more information--which is what every voter in America should be doing anyway.  Congrats to Al and the members of Team Franken--you have made politics a dinner-table topic that's accessible to political apathetics like myself.

As Franken illustrated so many of the ways that this administration has lied to, cheated and misused its power and the people of the USA, I laughed at the satire while becoming increasingly disgusted with those currently in power as well as the media, who spin it and twist it in order to continually deceive the American people. Everyone should read this book and try to absorb what Franken is saying here. I eagerly await his next book and his upcoming radio show!	2004-01-24

I believe that everyone has the right to say what they want - even if that speech is laden with hate and lies, something in which Franken is outstanding.  However, after seeing this untalented, unfunny excuse of a human being appear on Letterman's show, condemnation is what this witless, soulless swine needs.  As an added bonus, it seems that Al himself reads these \\"reviews\\".  Feast on this one Al! This book is really an excuse for this chronically unemployed liberal to spew hatred and fabrication among the gullible.  Since only a select few would ever read something written by this snake (if he dared pen a tome with a title that didn't invoke the image or name of Rush or Bill) he feels the need to attach himself to the successful newsmakers of the 90's and the 00's.    There once was a time when Franken was funny.  Can you remember when?  Yes, I know it is difficult to try to think back that far . . . but there was a time - remember the mid `70's? Franken hates Rush Limbaugh.  Hates Bill O'Reilly.  Hates Ann Coulter.  Hates President Bush.  But most of all - hates America AND himself.  Hey Al, you had 8 years with Clinton/Gore.  Why didn't you help change the world then?  You had DECADES on SNL to shape the hearts and minds of young people.  But you failed then too, didn't you?  The fact is that the majority of the American people do not agree with you or your liberal ideology!  It is that simple.  I am happy of a few things in life  - my wife and family - my job - and the fact that I do not pray to the same \\"god\\" that Franken does.  Al - how can you tell a sympathetic audience that the \\"Republicans really hate\\" when sighting a stupid comment from a \\"reviewer\\" on Amazon.com about the death of your mother- and turn around and say \\"all you can do is pray\\" when making veiled threats and opaque hopes that Rush Limbaugh meets his demise in prison?  Or after saying those sordid, disgusting things about Brit Hume?  Or writing deplorable things about the President?  Or calling Bill O'Reilly a liar (and worse)?  Did your mother tech you that?  I'll bet not.  It is amazing to me that you spout deceit, lies, hatred and loathing about anything and everything \\"Republican\\" or \\"Conservative\\" - but you do not want to allow any other person you deem \\"on the right\\" to have a say about ANYTHING.  I guess its all OK as long as we think like you, huh Al?  You stand for nothing but arrogance and rage.  You and Howard Dean can check into the same anger management class in a few weeks (after Dean goes mental on the campaign trail).  You had the nerve to mention you wanted to do \\"drug free radio\\" (a VERY funny statement about Rush Limbaugh's addiction) when in the same breath mentioning how awfully Rush talked about Jerry Garcia (something I'd love to see you prove, by the way).  You worked with addicts all of your SNL tenure . . . do the names John Beluchi, Chevy Chase and Chris Farley ring a bell?  You should have tried harder to do \\"drug free TV\\" first.  You (and all your liberal pals) were a miserable failure at that.  I really hope that your new \\"talk show\\" does as well as \\"Stuart Saves His Family\\" did at the box office.  All we can do is pray!  After your show flops, I'm sure you'll blame the \\"right\\", \\"Republicans\\" or \\"conservatives\\".  You'll point the finger at everyone but the one person that will deserve it - YOU.  You will fail.  Your show will fail.  All we can do is pray.  And right now, you need all the \\"prayers\\" you can get, Al . . . and believe me, I'll be the prayer warrior.  Stop the hate, Al.  Start with yourself.	2004-01-24

Al Franken as well as Ann Coulter are guilty of the same problem; they use humor and insults in an attempt to make people see their point. That's fine if you are writing for sheer entertainment value, not so much if serious political commentary is your goal. Mr. Franken may be a very talented writer and a somewhat smart guy, that, however, does not mean he has a clue as to how this country should be handled. If you are looking for a comedic look at politics, read this book. For those of you who are looking for serious political commentary, look elsewhere.	2004-01-23

After reading this book, I came away thinking of Mr. Franken as the left's answer to Rush Limbaugh - - both expressing many accurate opinions sprinkled among half-truths, distortions, reliance on questionable sources, etc. One major difference I noted between the two was Mr. Franken's use (overuse?) of vulgar and tasteless language. In my opinion, this application of &quot;colorful&quot; language distracts from his message and casts suspicion on his continuing claim of adhering to the moral high ground. As to Mr. Franken's intimation that 9/11 could most likely have been avoided if only President Bush had not spent so much time away from the office and implemented the anti terrorism plans developed under former President Clinton, I say rubbish.  I believe that thought is completely without merit, one of those after-the-fact assessments that can never be proved - - one way or the other.<br />According to the book, Mr. Franken and his investigative team employed rigorous research in attacking the comments of their targets, an admirable tactic. I have to wonder, though, if TeamFranken, consisting entirely of 14 Harvard students, might have had some built in biases. As Mr. Franken writes, \\"you can rest assured that almost every fact in this book is correct.\\"<br />Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right is an entertaining book. It points out several erroneous comments and misstatements, as well as questionable data, from many conservative spokesmen and politicians. Regrettably, much of the language in the book seems to be aimed at those who find the frequent use of profanity to be an acceptable form of communication.	2004-01-23

Having become a fan of Michael Moore's work, but being aware that there are websites out there tearing through every word he says or writes, I reckoned I wanted to learn more about &quot;his targets&quot; and those who, in some ways, are coming from the same side, if not a different perspective. <br />I have just finished &quot;Lies,and the Lying Liars...&quot; and although I have never seen or heard half of those Franken writes about, I have taken the trouble to find out about them via the web. Unless you are one of life's &quot;don't know's&quot; you are invariably going to end up taking sides, in some way, and I have found myself more strongly on the side of Franken/Moore for their &quot;attacks&quot; on your President. I blame him for many of today's ills, and I'm ashamed of our Prime Minister, whose support aided Bush's foray into Iraq.<br />Al's book is VERY funny, and , like my copy of Stupid White Men, I look forward to passing on to friends.<br />Incidentally, last year, apart from Harry Potter, Stupid White Men sold more copies than any other book over here.

While that may sound like a slam on the book, it's not. It's a tribute to the intellegent, well-thought out approach this book takes to tackling conservative accusations of &quot;liberal bias&quot; in the media and backs it up with examples of hypocrasy, slander, and just plain straight up lies of conservative &quot;news&quot; sources. <br />It's kind of interesting that some of the names mentioned in this book (O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter, etc.) have decided to counter accusations (I'm not a fact finder, so I'm not going to claim that this book speaks the absolute truth) with more yelling and screaming about liberal bias than with anything else.<br />NOTE: I don't know much about Coulter or Hannity so I can't really comment too much on the whole truth about them, but anyone who has seen &quot;The Factor&quot; should know that it's all about O'Reilly and his mike being turned up enough to shout down anyone he doesn't agree with, but I digress....<br />Well written, humorous, and thought-provoking would be how I would describe this book. Be forewarned however, there are definately parts of the book that will cause you to question how much integrity US media as a whole really has.	2004-01-22

Reading this book, you get angered by the way that the Bush-led govn't can't seem to take responsibility for its own faults, and is amply content to point the unpatriotic finger at those who would criticize them.

Usually in their reviews they resort to vague accusations of bias and dishonesty without pointing out any specific examples, or they just use childish name calling.  The thing is, Bush represents a philosophy of life in which one aquires as much wealth and power as one can, any way one can, and to hell with the rest of the world.  When someone like Franken points this out, and shows how at odds this behavior is with any claim of &quot;compassionate conservatism&quot; there really is no way for Bush supporters to counter attack based on facts and logic, so they resort to ad hominem garbage.  Read negative reviews for further illustration of this principle.	2004-01-22

I don't buy the whole \\"liberal bias\\" the conservatives have whined about for years.  However there are biases--liberal and conservative.

Whatever.<BR>It seems to me that people would be doing themselves and this country of ours a favor if they tried to read what the \\"other side\\" is writing and sincerely tried to understand the other point of view.  From what I see on Amazon's own reviews, hardly anyone is doing that.  Most of the opinionated books have a 1/2 TOTALLY FOR, and 1/2 TOTALLY AGAINST crowd.<BR>I found this a good read and reccomend it, despite my criticisms of it, yet I also do so with books from conservative authors as well such as George Will (hey at least he has higher standards than Rush Limbaugh).  <BR>Seems to me the people totally hating it are the people who've put certain conservative icons on a pedastal, thinking they can do no wrong.

They seek to silence dissent and use the tactic of lying on a Goebbels-like scale to undermine those who don't toe the party line.  Their true religion is fascism and they are defenders of the faith.<br />The constant and relentless telling of lies is the heart of their strategy.  When one has no genuine credibility, lies are the only recourse.  Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Bernard Goldberg, Andrew Sullivan, Robert Novak, Tucker Carlson--all the Propaganda Ministers of the Bush regime are professional liars who are fanatically devoted to The Cause.  The depths of their duplicity and immorality are carefully examined in &quot;Lies,&quot; and it's a truly enlightening experience to understand the agenda of our conservative media.<br />This is one of the most important books of our time, as we face an incredibly important election this year.  In 2004, we will decide whether democracy in America is worth keeping, or whether the cowardly millionaire draft-dodgers who are slaughtering American soldiers for their own corporate gain will continue to lead us down the road to serfdom.  Read Al Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; and make the right choice.	2004-01-13

The best example of this in the past few years has got to be Ann Coulter who, whether in her books or in her TV appearances, seems physiologically incapable of telling the truth.  For Ann, the appropriateness of what she says or writes is determined not by the accuracy of the statement but by it's value in supporting her premise.  But make no mistake:  While Coulter is the worst offender, these characteristics are present in most or all books of this type, on the left as well as on the right.<BR>   Imagine my surprise, then, when I read Franken's new book - It's actually ACCURATE, and properly documented.  I nearly dropped off my chair with surprise!  As you might expect, he pulls no punches; and the smugness with which he insults his political adversaries is less than amusing (he calls it sarcasm - I call it boorishness).  This criticism aside, however, I must point out that the FACTS he presents are accurate and insightful.  His footnotes and endnotes provide a clear picture of the context of his accusations.  All in all, this is a superb work which people from all sides of the political spectrum - those, at least, who love the truth - will find valuable.  My highest recommendation.	2004-01-13

It was a pure delight to read Franken blowing away the well-oiled, well-financed right-wing propaganda machine. Al takes on all comers, such as Ann Coulter (who was long overdue), Bill O'Reilly, the myth of the liberal media in the 2000 stolen election (which is backed up by a real study) and all the rest.<br />No matter your political persuasion, give this book a look with an open mind and your laughing gun cocked. I would imagine if you are a conservative, you aren't interested, but if you are conservative, you may be surprised at the proof Franken offers up to debunk a lot of characters on the right.<br />I don't want to give it all away, but Al leaves \\"O'Lie-lly,\\" as he calls him, standing naked in public without a towel for the world to see. Exposing Bill's lie about his former show, Inside Edition, winning a Peabody, his voter registration record, and O'Reilly's tactics when someone confronts him with one of his own lies, Al gives Bill what's long been coming to him.<br />Not only is this book a great counterattack to all of the radical schnooks on the right, it's also well documented and researched, unlike Coulter's blarney. I'm not only proud to own the hardcover edition of this book, which I occasionally open up for reading and laughter from time to time, but this book makes me proud to be a Democrat. It's a must have for anyone who is tired of the right wing's incessant lying and distortion of the facts under this current administration. Buy it buy it buy it! I'm waiting with bated breath what Al has to say about Rush's latest slip ups, the latest lies of the right, et al in his next book. I'll buy an advanced copy right now!	2004-01-12

Oh well, why not? We all like to be heard.<BR>I give this book 5 stars, not because I want to bring the average up, but I thought Franken is brilliant. I also thought Michael Moore was brilliant, but in a different way. Franken goes for precision, striking at the 'enemy' by out-researching them, and checking their claims with the help of his research team, Team Franken. None of this is done unfairly, though. They are all given the chance to defend themselves. Franken is less confrontational than Moore in many ways - relying on his wit and charm in his many personal interactions with the 'subjects' of his book. But he can be even more biting. He shows no restraint in his scorn of Ann Coulter, for instance. But he does have a conscience. His undercover interview at Bob Jones university, and his early-on support of the Iraq war are not events he is particularly proud of.<BR>The book has a quirky format, and chapters with titles such as 'I Meet Former First Lady Barbara Bush and It Doesn't Go Well'. (Some chapters are actually shorter than this title).<BR>Whether Franken is 100% accurate, I can't tell, but he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who has trouble admitting failure. So if you disagree with him, you could probably tell him directly - he might even buy you lunch. I'm sure he'd love the challenge.	2004-01-12

If all you require from a book is that it call anyone outside of the left-wing nasty names like 'poophead' then this book might make you happy.  Or you can save yourself some money and just watch 'Jackass' on TV. <br />For those not militantly and religiously committed to the left-wing this book is neither insightful nor funny. It is hateful, bigoted, and dishonest. It appears to be yet another desperate attempt to recover the lost credibility that Bernard Goldberg's best-selling book, &quot;Bias&quot; has recently taken from the Left. And it is no mere coincidence that Franken's latest empty political joke book was rapidly released just prior to Bernard Goldberg's newest best-seller, &quot;Arrogance.&quot;  <br />If personal attacks against the opponents of socialism are what you love then this book was written for you.

The following comes from frankenlies dot com:<br />#17: We Are Discouraged, Al ... By Your Facts<BR>Chapter 22 of Franken's book is called &quot;I Grow Discouraged About the Tone.&quot; He spends its first couple pages revisiting 2001 media reports that there had been vandalism to White House offices by outgoing Clinton staffers before Bush's people moved in. In the end, of course, Franken tells his readers that these reports were bunk. On pages 153-154 of Lies, he writes,<BR>&quot;Of course, none of this horrible vandalism actually occurred ... Fourteen months later, this, the final investigation of the Clinton administration, yielded a 217-page report that found no damage to the White House nor to the Executive Office Building. `There is no record of damage that may have been deliberately caused by employees of the Clinton administration.'&quot;<br />I guess Franken is a comedian, because the `Conclusions' section of that actual report begins as follows,<br />Damage, theft, vandalism, and pranks occurred in the White House complex during the 2001 presidential transition. Incidents such as the removal of keys from computer keyboards; the theft of various items; the leaving of certain voice mail messages, signs, and written messages; and the placing of glue on desk drawers clearly were intentional acts.<br />But what about Franken's cited quotation (the one I put in bold) that appears to be from the 217-page report? The answer: It isn't. It's from an earlier GAO review from the spring of 2001, nearly thirteen months before the final 217-page report was released! In his &quot;Sources and Notes&quot; section at the back of Lies, (on page 359) Franken references a GAO &quot;report&quot; and a salon.com column from May 2001. The final 217-page GAO report is dated June 2002! Franken uses sources that date before the final investigation even being conducted!!<br />By the way, the line about there being &quot;no record&quot; (from May 2001) essentially refers to the fact that the White House/Bush administration had not yet themselves submitted a report (or &quot;record&quot;) about deliberate damage that had occurred. (Records were eventually submitted.) It was not a conclusion that there was &quot;no damage,&quot; as Franken leads his readers to believe.<br />In the end, there was, in fact, several thousands of dollars in damage.<br />Some of the vandalism? Here are some examples from a White House letter/report within the final GAO report. (Numberings of these examples are mine.)<br />1. \\" ... more than 20 W [keyboard] keys glued to the walls; at least 14 to 19 pieces of furniture overturned; computers piled up or overturned on floor; telephones and fax machines unplugged and/or piled on the floor in 25 or more offices; at least a dozen fax lines switched; 5 or 6 glass desk tops broken; a plant dumped in the middle of the floor; drawers open and their contents dumped on the desk or the floor; food inside of desks; and beer, wine and liquor bottles littering offices.\\" <BR>2. A sticker was affixed to a filing cabinet that read \\"jail to the thief\\". <BR>3. A key to a file cabinet was found broken off and still hanging in its lock by a metal thread &quot;(suggesting that the damage occurred not long before the transition) and, when the locksmith opened the cabinet, a Gore bumper sticker with the words `Bush Sucks' was prominently displayed inside.\\" <BR>4. A sign comparing President Bush to a chimpanzee was found \\"in a number of printers\\" and \\"laced\\" throughout reams of paper. <BR>5. A sign was taped to a desk. It was a mock MasterCard ad that included a picture of President Bush and read, \\"New bong: $50, cocaine habit: $300, Finding out that the good-old-boy network can still rig an election in the Deep South: priceless. For the rest of us there's honesty.\\" <BR>6. A sign was found reading, \\"VP's cardiac unit\\" <BR>7. Graffiti in the men's restroom read, \\"What W did to democracy, you are about to do in here\\" <br />There's more, but the point is clear. It's also pretty sobering. If all of this happened at a frat house, it would be one thing. But these events reportedly occurred within buildings that are part of our national treasure. Dignity and respect, anyone? Geesh.<br />How much do all of you want to bet that Franken WILL NOT make proper revisions for his paperback edition?	2004-01-10

This is a great eye-opener for those who actually believe the lies being marketed by the right, but unfortunately they won't read it (thier leader doesn't even like to read). And this is a better book for those who want to laugh at the right, and gain some useful ammo when those mixed up right-wingers start spinning. Frankin debunks the myth of the liberal media, pointing out some of the glaring truths of corporate-owned media. Unless you really, truly believe that Bush was telling the truth when he said &quot;By far a vast majority of my tax cuts help the bottom half&quot; (lol) then you should buy this book. The Bill O'Really and Ann Coulter section are great, proving with their own words what lying liars they are. <br />Frankin does have a boring section that I mostly skipped through. He points out how NONE of the current war-hawks in the administration, with the exception of Powell, ever served in the military (sorry Bush, putting on a flight suit after going AWOL in the National Guard doesn't count)and then makes up a hypothetical scenario with them all in battle. Its not that funny or entertaining, so I recommend skipping it. <br />Frankin doesn't cover the &quot;mushroom cloud&quot; of lies that led up to the war, or how Bush manupulated the public into thinking that Iraq supported 9-11 or had ties to Al-Queda, because many of those lies are just now coming to light. But he does detail how the Clinton administration stressed the Al-Queda threat (remember, Clinton bombed Afganistan in 1998)and how the Bush administration slept on it. If I recall correctly, before Sept 11th, Bush was taking a month-long vacation down at the ranch.<br />Frankin doesn't cover some of the bigger lies of Bush, instead he focuses on some of the right-wings minions. He gives short treatment to Bush's horrible education, environmental and foriegn policy record. Bush's religious hypocracy for example (I don't think Jesus was a reverse-Robin Hood, giving to the rich donors at the expense of working Americans) isn't mentioned. <br />In fact, the right complains so much about this book, which really is harmless, it seems like they are rather...sensitive. I mean no one claims treason when Bush personally denies due process rights guaranteed under the Constitution, but the right loves to use that word all the time. It is true that the Nuremburg trials highest charge was waging a war of aggression, which is exactly what Bush did, but Frankin never hits any hard points like this as Noam Chomsky would. Its a great book anyway.	2004-01-09

He hasn't done anything remotely funny since...well, I guess he never was that funny. Franken's star-power peaked about as high as his sub-par movie, &quot;Stuart Saves His Family,&quot; which is probably remembered by only a handful of people. <br />So that really didn't pan out like he would've liked it to. I guess that meant it was time to try a new angle to get the mindless sheeple in America to fill his pockets. What better way than to pander to left-wingers and their agenda, since most of them really are simply mindless sheeple. There's an audience out there who are just so emotionally livid that a Republican is President, they'll eat up anything that is anti-conservative.<br />That's where Al and his book come in. However, Mr. Franken has zero credibility and it is clearly evident that he verbally manipulates the things he choses to write about in order to suit his assertions.<br />Here's just one of many examples from frankenlies.com that reveals such tactics:<br />&quot;Bush's 2001 tax-cut plan is another target of Franken (Chapter 35 of Lies). Franken spins an array of numbers to give his readers the impression that George Bush's tax cut is just a swell arrangement for the rich.<br />What has a more objective source said about Bush's plan? Time magazine, certainly not a Bush administration sympathizer, admitted Bush's $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan, &quot;is not a sweetheart deal for the rich. It's primarily a sweetheart deal for just the people whom, [Tom Daschle said], Bush's plan 'shortchanges' -- working families.'1<br />The lowest tax bracket under Bush's plan was reduced from 15 to 10 percent, a difference of 33 percent. No other tax bracket sees nearly such a change. Of course, if you want to look at the tax plan in pure dollars, as Franken does, Bush's plan is open to all sorts of spin. The bottom line is if you give a gazillionaire any kind of tax cut, he will obviously keep more money than someone in the bottom bracket. But that's because he's a gazillionaire. Any tax cut at the top end will benefit the top end in raw numbers alone. Under the Bush plan, the top bracket is lowered from 39.6 percent to 33 percent, a difference of almost 17 percent. Compare that to the 33 percent savings found among those in the lowest bracket. Now people can understand President Bush when he says, 'The bottom end of the economic ladder receives the biggest percentage cuts.'2 The President is telling the truth. But Franken?<br />The issue of taxes has been major issue of debate between conservatives and liberals for eons. President Kennedy (a liberal) believed in tax cuts. President Clinton did not. Each side offers a respectable position. The least Franken can do is 'engage his readers honestly' (Lies, page 20).&quot;<br />__________________<br />Notes:<br />1  Frank Pellegrini, \\"Dissecting Bush's Tax-Cut Plan,\\" Time, February 27, 2001.<br />2  Ibid.	2004-01-08

I am a big fan of these kinds of books and enjoy reading from both the right-wing perspective (Coulter, Goldberg, etc.) and the left-wing perspective (Franken, Moore, Eric Alterman, etc.).  I thought that this book was an excellent example of the genre.  And yet I have to say that, as to the specific issue of whether the media tilts to the right or to the left, I find authors on both sides to be persuasive.  And yet how can this be, given that they are arguing diametrically opposing viewpoints?  <br />I think it is because the two sides are not in fact making directly contradictory arguments (all appearances to the contrary).  Rather they are arguing at cross-purposes like ships passing in the night.  The argument from the left (which is particularly well argued in Eric Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media?\\" among other books) is that it is ridiculous to say that there is a liberal bias when the vast majority of commentators on TV and newspapers and especially on talk radio and on the Internet proudly profess their conservative leanings.  For example, it is probably far easier to name 10-15 self-proclaimed conservatives in the media than self-proclaimed liberals.  I think that this is a perfectly valid argument.  <br />The argument from the right however is somewhat different and frankly a bit more subtle.  They claim that it is not the media you know that is the problem--it is the media you don't know. More specifically, it is not the famous commentators who are at issue since you know where they are coming from right from the outset and there is no hidden agenda there.  Rather (at least accoring to the right) it is those (relatively) nameless, faceless people who write not the editorials but the actual news stories which appear in the news articles, which, in theory, are supposed to report \\"just the facts\\". However rather then reporting just the facts, they manage to do their own little editorializing within the context of these supposed \\"straight news\\" articles.  Thesewriters tend to lean well left of center and tend to be concentrated at the large city papers (the New York Times being the prime example, with the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times right there as well) and the writers of the newtwork news shows.  The book \\"Journalistic Fraud\\" by Bob Kohn (which focuses solely on the New York Times) provides numerous examples of how the liberal leanings of the Times may be discerned not from the editorial pages (which are fair game for any viewpoint) but rather from the sneaky ways in which the writers of the news articles surreptitiously inject their views into what are supposed to be editorial-free articles.  Although there are countless examples of how this technique is used, an oft-mentioned example would be the use of the adjectives \\"conservative\\" or \\"right-wing\\" to describe a person who is in fact conservative or right-wing, but NOT to use the adjectives \\"liberal\\" or \\"left-wing\\" to describe a person who leans equally far to the left.  <br />Thus, if the question is one of counting heads, i.e. how many KNOWN and self-proclaimed liberals vs. conservatives are there in the media (which is a perfectly fair question), then there is no way that the media can be described as liberal.  If the question is, what are the true political and social leanings of all the behind-the-scenes writers of the supposed NEWS articles in the newspapers and TV (also a perfectly fair question), then the argument for the liberal media becomes persuasive indeed even if it is somewhat harder to pin down and less easily demonstrable.	2004-01-08

I don't have much to add, except that a pretty large percentage of the reviews here are completely wrong. Of course conservatives won't like the book, and you can tell from many of the one-star reviews that such reviewers didn't even read the book anyway. Reactionaries, just like their political heroes. Also watch for five-star reviews (not including this one) in which reviewers agree wholeheartedly with Franken's liberal views. That's fine with me because I'm (mostly) on that side of the political spectrum myself. But those types of reviewers have missed the point of the book. Franken is exposing the style of lying utilized by conservatives and their right-wing media lapdogs, by using the same kinds of polemics and truth-stretching himself, as an illustrative device. He's using the phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot; in exactly the same way they are. That's called &quot;irony&quot; folks, and I don't mean the type found in an Alanis Morrisette song. If you're a left-winger who can't figure that out, at least you'll like the way Franken shoots down conservative dogma with things they've never heard of - facts and evidence. If you're a right-winger who also missed Franken's use of irony, and have condemned the book in the usual reactionary and uninformed fashion, congratulations for taking the bait. You have proved Franken's points better than even he could have imagined. Next time, cut out the middleman and just jump right up into the boat. [~doomsdayer520~]	2004-01-07

You will laugh, you will cry, you will be a more informed member of society.  Al Fraken's satirical style is refreshing and a source of much enjoyment.  Fraken's wit is the perfect showcase for his insights. The most valuable quality of the book is Fraken's use of facts.  Fraken does not fall victim to baseless accusations or ideological spouting, although the reader is well aware of his view of things.   The book may be dripping with statements clearly stating Fraken's personal opinions, but they do not void his claims that have been proven by facts. Fraken's liberal opinion is deeply woven throughout the text, like the humor it is an integral part of the personality of the novel.   Reading it is like having a one sided conversation with the man himself (or so I like to imagine).  As in any interaction between one human and another, if there is a difference in opinions one or both parties have a high likelihood of being offended.  The same rings true for this book, it is proudly and boldly liberal, a reader identifying him or herself with the right will more than likely take offense.  However, everyone regardless of political affiliation, should be aware of the lies exposed in this book.  The qualities of this book, humorous, well written, insightful and factual, transcend political animosity.	2004-01-06

I could not believe these right wing media moguls could so conspiciuosly lie and distort the truth, with sneaky play on words, that even the most careful reader/listener might misconstrue. But his documentation is beyond refute, despite his selectivity. With outrageous humor he does to conservatives what they do to liberals daily, infecting the minds of those poor lazy mindless Americans that take everything the right wing media tells them for granted. Even if you do not believe a word he says, with wit and humor he reminds Americans that they should always question information and look at both sides of a story. Inquire, get the facts, make your own choices and then rub it their faces when your right and their wrong. A must read for everyone who doubts the mainstream media be it liberal or conservative.	2004-01-06

Al Franken takes aim at the conservative politicians and pundits that ride outrageous boasts and accusations to greater power and profit.  It's a simple enough task, you just do a little fact checking or number crunching and voila, the truth is revealed.  Okay, maybe he could list some of the claims that turned out to be true, but that isn't nearly as entertaining as exposing Bill O'Reilly's facetious claim to two Peabody Awards; or Ann Coulter's illusion of friendship with him.<br />That's not to say that this is a book dedicated to amplifying the occasional misspeak or slip of the tongue.  As a personal friend of the late Paul Wellstone, Franken is incensed with the characterizations of a memorial service (for the senator, his family and friends that perished with him in a plane crash) that likened it to a crudely partisan political rally.  He adroitly compares the smattering of boos that some Republican senators received to the treatment of Hillary Clinton at a post-9/11 tribute at Madison Square Garden.  And his high dudgeon is as well founded as it is well defended.<br />What separates Franken from many other partisan pundits is that he is genuinely funny and not reluctant to poke fun at himself.  When a smart-alecky idea, to have fun with the campus recruiters for Bob Jones University falls a little flat, he relates the entire adventure with self-deprecating humor.  He also owns up to second thoughts regarding his participation in an early pro-war with Iraq rally.<br />It's Franken's wit that ultimately holds sway.  With terms like \\"traitor\\" and \\"slander\\" often being hurled from the Right, the Great Political Debate is decidedly less high brow than most of us would like; but at least Al has fun with it.  Even the iconic Barbara Bush comes under fire after a chance encounter on an airline flight.<br />If your taste in opinion shapers runs more along the lines of Coulter, O'Reilly and Limbaugh, you might be better advised to just sit by your radio.

If we go through life unaware of what mischief our government is doing behind our back than something is terribly wrong with our society. Franken briliantly lays out his concrete points of evidence against the right with a fair overview of each situation thoroughly proving his point. In Chapter 16 \\"Operation Ignore\\", Franken proves that the Bush administration could have done much more to prevent the tragedy of September 11, 2001 than they actually did and that they were warned of such attacks by people in our own government. This is an easy statement for anyone to state but Franken digs into the situation and unearths the real truth and the real happenings involved with this statement which for some may be hard to accept but is nonetheless true and a proven fact. This book is definitely convincing due to its in depth analysis of each atrocity. it is equally comprehensive. Even people unfamiliar with government lingo and normality will have no problem comprehending this book. Franken is not necessarily biased, given the topic. True he does not delve into the flaws  of many liberals but he does admit some faults they have made over the years. From reading this book, the most stand-out question in my mind is why the American public is so oblivious to the wrongdoing that is occuring behind our backs and why we, as a country, are not in a political uproar about our lying, untrustable government. One characteristic of Franken is without a doubt his incorporation of humor into his life and his work, to infuse his book of government of and the right with comedy makes the book much more enjoyable, understandable and overall more accomplished. With titles such as  \\"The Bame America's Ex President First Crowd\\", \\"The Lying Years\\", Operation Chickenhawk:Episode One\\" and \\"Vast Lagoons of Pig Feces: The Bush Environmental Record\\" how could anyone not enjoy and not agree entirely with Al Franken and \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.\\"	2004-01-06

First off, this is not a serious discussion of liberal politics and thought. Lies and The Lying Liars Who Tell Them is what you might call a guilty pleasure. It's a humorous respite for any centrist or liberal who has gotten tired of turning on their TV or radio and being subjected to self-aggrandizing ego-maniacs hysterically spit out spiteful, bitter, unsubstantiated invective in their direction. Franken's primary goal is not to convince the reader that Democrats are correct, but rather to defend the reader, as well as the majority of Americans, from the vitriol (including accusations of conspiracy and treason, taken nearly verbatim from the Cold War era HUAC) routinely directed at them from hard-right-wing agitators who pose as journalists and commentators.  He uses a team of Harvard researchers to document how men like Hannity and Limbaugh, who have no journalistic education or experience, have made million-dollar careers out of polarizing American politics by pandering to gullible people with specious arguments, systematic deception, and blatant intellectual dishonesty. The book is filled with examples of how these pundits lie about everything from their political party affiliation to their age, how they filter news by telling their audience only what they want to hear, and how they will not hesitate to bend, distort, or invent facts to support their arguments. Coulter, in particular, is so far out of the solar system that Franken has a difficult time choosing which examples to use.<br />The second half of the book discusses the broader phenomena of right-wing news, demonstrating how organizations like Fox News, The Washington Times, and The New York Post decry what they perceive to be a liberal bias in the media, while making absolutely no effort to be fair and balanced themselves. Franken details how men like Wesley Pruden and Roger Ailes routinely violate journalistic ethics in an effort to slant news in a conservative direction. Pruden, for instance, has anadmitted habit of inserting politically-motivated contents into stories and columns in his newspaper without even consulting the authors. Such unethical actions are almost unthinkable at a mainstream newspaper; at the Washington Times, they're common practice. Franken also shows how conservative partisans use the right-wing press \\"echo chamber\\" to force questionable and unsubstantiated stories, especially Republican talking points and scandals, into the mainstream news media.  There is one emotional part in particular where Franken drops his humorous tone entirely and details how pundits such as Tucker Carlson and Peggy Noonan worked overtime to wildly misrepresent the funeral of his good friend Paul Wellstone. Both Noonan and Carlson later admitted that neither had actually watched the funeral before opening their mouths. Instead, they had watched one or two brief clips shown to them by \\"friends\\".<br />Overall, Lies and The Lying Liars Who Tell Them is well-written, quite funny, and painstakingly documented. Franken makes a particular point of avoiding most of the misleading and dishonest techniques used by the pundits he debunks. I'd recommend the book to anyone tired of listening to Bill O'Reilly refer to himself as a \\"news analyst\\" who's \\"looking out for you\\".<br />As a side note, it's nice to see that each and every member of the Ann Coulter fanclub had enough time on their hands to show up, falsely claim to have read Franken's book, and then go on to regurgitate, in some cases word for word, the same vague, inaccurate and spiteful invective they heard Hannity and O'Reilly level at Franken the day before.  A word of advice to the so-called \\"serious conservative\\" reviewers: You're embarrassing yourselves. Intelligent, thinking conservatives don't bother reading Franken (they don't read Coulter either), and they certainly don't waste their time logging onto the internet to lie about having read his book to drag down its Amazon user rating. That's just plain sad.	2004-01-06

I really like Al's alternate title - &quot;Bearers of False Witness and the False Witness That They Bear&quot; - because it brings home a point that underscores his whole diatribe: the current Administration and its propaganda mill are particularly despicable because they are so smugly self-righteous about their duplicity. I appreciated his deliberate hyperbole and frequent sarcasm, and found myself uncharacteristically cheering for his from-the-hip bravado, despite my aversion to such behavior among decision-makers. I found most chapters had enough humor to release the sense of outrage, with the exception of the Paul Wellstone story, which I ultimately felt deserved the serious treatment it was given. More than anything else I am grateful for the lesson learned, that it is so easy in this day and age to corroborate information that there is no need to take his or anyone else's word for anything. Case in point is the &quot;frankenlies&quot; website that was linked by a recent reviewer. I took the trouble to check it out - I mean REALLY check it out, and found in just a few clicks of the mouse that in many cases, their own sources discredit their arguments.

It was clear that he had a political agenda in writing this book, and the transparency of this agenda inspires only skepticism for the reader.	2004-01-05

I want to thank Al Franken for writing such an important book for todays public.  It is a must read for all Right-Wing Conservatives, but considering their &quot;pack mentality&quot; chances of that are slim-to-none. These people would rather spew uneducated hate than have an open mind to the truth.  The fact that Rupert Murdock has now purchased more media outlets to spew his form on hatred says that America needs to be afraid, be very afraid.  The dumbing down of America is starting at the top with GW who spent 42% of his time on vacation last year keeping out of Cheney's, Ascroft's and Rumsfeld's hair so they can run the country.  It will take numerous years for the US to recover from these environmental robber-barons.  It took Al Franken to point out what intelligent people in this country have known all along.	2004-01-05

I just read &quot;Dude, Where's My Country?&quot; by Michael Moore but his humor doesn't come off as witty and infectious as Al Franken's. I was seriously laughing out loud to this book! He does an amazing job at pointing out all the lies the right-wingers have told but at the same time is honest about the left. The difference between Al and Ann Coulter is, Al is honest, smarter, funny and frankly better looking than she is. As far as books go, I enjoyed Michael Moore's &quot;Dude, Where's My Country?&quot; more because he writes with more passion.

Before reading each chapter, I truly tried to put all my liberal biases aside and look at Franken's book objectively.  What I came to find, however, was that it doesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or a Republican - the lying and manipulating amongst the likes of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and yes, George W. himself is indisputable.  Franken's many years as a Saturday Night Live writer are evident on every page, and it truly makes this book a fast read, but certainly does not subtract from its depth.  What I love about this book is that it shows the wide, unclear, pumped up, and ambiguous statements that many prominent Republicans use to gain support and appear as though they have made a point.  This aggressive and defensive technique employed by the likes of Bill O'Reilly need to be countered in some way, and Franken definitely does it.<br /> These wide, sweeping conservative quotes (ex.  \\"Liberals hate all religion except Islam\\" - Ann Coulter) need to be shown for the nonsense that they are.  What I found most shocking is some of the complete fabrications of truth that were exposed from publications as big as The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.  It questions the journalistic integrity of many of these key publications.  The greatest example of this is the Wall Street Journal crediting Bush for the decline in violent crime from 1993-2001 and criticizing Clinton's gun control advocacy - completely forgetting who was president during those years.<br /> Ultimately, we should all want good, calm, political debate, and in almost all of Franken's phone calls and discussions with many conservatives, their defensiveness makes it impossible.  This book is not completely lacking of bias or bad arguments.  Some chapters are in bad taste, but still retain the comedy (see Franken's hysterical trip to Bob Jones University). The bottom line seems to be that we need to actually READ and see through political lies, and once we've done that, THEN to make a political decision. Liberals and conservatives both love this country, and debate does not change that.	2004-01-04

But even if the worst is yet to come, this collection of slapstick humor and wisecracks is tilted enough to assure that its subtitle -- A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right -- should only be said between snickers or with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />I don't differ with most aspects of author Al Franken's political agenda. He makes important points regarding the GOP's reliance on &quot;Clinton bashing&quot; as a fallback explanation for almost anything that goes awry. And I have always enjoyed seeing political figures with the spotlight placed on their job-related lies and misrepresentations, something that Mr. Franken's eager team of Harvard researchers seems adept at uncovering. In my opinion, the basic ideas behind his views on the Bush tax cuts, the war in Iraq, and election strategies come close to the mark.<br />But I wonder why it is so hard to produce some kind of thoughtful and intelligent partisan discussion these days, something biting and serious but written well enough to capture the public's imagination. By that standard, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them falls flat on its face. The book instead settles for being Mr. Franken's latest self-centered treatise with another title that sounds as if it was written by an R-rated Dr. Seuss and filled with arguments pat enough that they could fit into word balloons over the heads of teenage comic book characters. We deserve better.	2004-01-04

He dissects the rhetorical discourse and actions of the right-wing media and political figures with his satire and wit to ultimately create a book that is both well supported and entertaining. While Franken in no way does not give politeness a second thought nor does he shy away from injecting his opinion, he consistently backs up his arguments with thorough facts and examples. <BR> Franken shines light on many of the assumptions of the right-wing, such as the notion that liberals hate America or an existing liberal bias in the media. While these assumptions have been questioned and examined before, Franken's account is unique in that he raises his arguments in a manner that employs accuracy and humor. Sources range from personal conversations to document analysis to his own exploratory investigation. While some may argue that Franken undoubtedly has an opinion on the subject matter, they cannot deny the profundity of evidence he uses to support it.	2004-01-04

Just don't expect it live by it's tag line &quot;A fair and balanced look at the right&quot;.<br />Al Fraken is a very good political comedy writer.  And taking the book on these terms it works very well.  Things begin to get muddled when Al starts making serious allegations against such institutions as CNN, The New York Times and Time magazine.  The picture he paints is a bleeak one.  Essentially he is saying that we can't trust our newspapers, magazines, news broadcasts and especially our politicians when they are talking about politics because they are all lying to us.  Maybe it's true, but the comical tone undercuts these intriguing ideas.<br />Al knows his comedy weakens his stance and even plays into it.  This tactic left me unsure of how to be consuming the book, comedy - or serous attack.  Now that I've finished the book it's obvious Al Fraken wants it both ways.  Sorry to say, it doesn't gel into a masterwork.  Taken as a political comedy sketch though it's a laugh riot.  Approach the book from that angle and all liberals (and maybe even some conservatives) will enjoy it.  Hopefully some other less comical writer can tackle the seroius allegations Al Fraken makes.	2004-01-04

Sean Hannity during the 2000 election repeatedly slandered Gore by spreading false information about him. Franken calls him on it.  I really liked the chapter Supply Side Jesus.  It was funny and it made the point that many Christians especially conservative Christians don't follow the true teachings of Jesus. In my opinion this book wasn't as funny as Franken's other book Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and it could have been better if he edited some of the less important stuff out. On the other hand this book is more significant because it comes at a time when conservatives have the upper hand.  I checked that website about Franken's supposed lies.  It was pathetic.

The obivious reason you see this in the title was said by Al Franken himself to be a stab at Fox News.  However, it is really Al's way of trying to trick readers into thinking he is somehow fair and unbiased, despite the fact his values are about as left as you can go before being on the right.  There is no doubt Al Franken has a cute ablity to twist facts and bits and pieces of information into mindless meanderings in a rather talented way.  Give him credit.  <br />However, my critism of Al Franken is the same I said of Ann Coulter.  Simply, they lose their arguement by jumping into playground name calling.  Al Franken is a smart guy who happens to be a very negative in his views of the world.  I ended up being glad I don't think like Al or even Ann.  God how horrible the world must be to these folks.  The biggest difference between Al and Ann is the truth behind their facts.  Ann does a good job in backing up her facts even though she underminds her arugments with a biting wit that appeals to conservatives but, loses its point.  Al on the other hand twists the facts to make his point which finally resembles something other than the original truth.  Its a funny thing about modern leftest liberals.  They seem to make up the facts as they go, to try and prove what they believe which is Republicans and Conservatives are evil minded people bent on world domination by destorying the helpless poor.  <br />In the end, I gave this book 2 starts instead of one, because its actually kinda funny, in a sad sort of way.  If Al actually lightened up a little and find some positive meaning in life and leave the playground, he might actually write something that does not undermind his arguement.  Then again, his book wouldn't be the same.  Maybe thats the point?	2004-01-03

I strikes me as odd that the one star fanatics here accuse the left of slander, treason, idiocy, lying, and controlling the media when they don't apply the same scrutinizing eye to their own group.  One of Frankens main themes in the book is the myth of liberal controlled media.  He is completely correct, somehow the conservative controlled corporations that control most of the media have managed to fool it's followers into thinking the left is actually in control.

For the main reason being that in the first few pages of his book he talks about his 14 colledge graduates that he picked to do the fact finding for the book so that he would be sure to only tell the truth in his book and point out the lies in other authors books like Ann Coulter,Bill O'Rielly and Hannity and Colmes. I have also read reviews from other readers saying that his foul language and foul remarks make Al Franken look like an a$$hole himself rather than the people he writes about in his books. As a high school student a really dont have alot of intrest in reading about politics but the way Al Franken writes his books it makes it easier to read a book like that just by throwing in some funny jokes and comments he has about the lying media he hates. Overall i think that this was a really good book for a high school student like me to read to get a basic understanding on the liberal media and to start to become interested in politics. I would recommend this book to any high school student who wanted to learn about politics and how the media system works.

Message to Larissa Winstead: a book review is customarily done by someone who has ACTUALLY read the book, as opposed to simply knee-jerking opposition. It's called &quot;informed dissent&quot;, and you might consider pursuing the concept further.<br />Picking up where Franken's &quot;Rush Limbaugh&quot; piece had scratched the surface, &quot;Lies&quot; is a hilarious but fascinating - and, frankly, somewhat depressing - investigation of the political right's assault on both civility and fair play in America. There is unquestionably big money to be made in the conservative camp, and plenty of opportunity to demonize opponents and belittle issues in the pursuit of rather transparent (and often financially motivated) goals. Franken's dissections of hostility merchants like Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reilly (amongst others) are not only generally humorous and carefully constructed, but also backed up by the types of factual material these characters so easily sidestep in their own writings.<br />As well, if the material dealing with Bush's Operation Ignore and the events leading up to 9/11 are even marginally accurate, the United States will have truly become a frightening place to live.	2004-01-01

The San Francisco Chronicle has his book as #1, and I consider the SF Chronicle to be an unbiased newspaper, yeah, right!!! They are as liberal as they come. I wish we could just get this country back to telling the truth and quit pointing fingers everywhere. Terrible book, do not buy it. Worthless!	2003-12-31

This book would be a revelation to those Americans who slip in and out of Cable News,Time and Newsweek for a few minutes a week. It would be an eye-opener to those hardworking Americans who are too busy to see the external world, in this case the politico/news establishment, for what it is: a complex world of power, lies, print, videotape, colliding ideology, any means to an end.<br />Furthermore, whether ignorant or informed, if one is a reasonable and liberal person then one will be thoroughly entertained by Franken's wit. He is the American counterpart to the highly educated, scintillatingly funny British comedians like Stephen Fry and Rowan Atkinson. By liberal, I mean simply: liberal.<br />And by the way, If you do read the book Kharap Juta means bad shoes and Choto means small - I venture to guess that these names were suggested by Miss Chug.	2003-12-31

This book reinforced my views 200%. Franken's witty and hilarious writing style even kept my interest piqued when I didn't have background knowledge on his topics. It was very refreshing to have someone point out the ease with which others can distort facts. Since reading &quot;Lies . . &quot;, I have found myself reviewing the source lists for all non-fiction books and re-evaluating facts presented just in case they were tinkered with. This book is an invaluable teaching tool on searching for truth even if you don't agree with Franken's political beliefs. However, after a few hundred pages, people who are not fully politically-minded (like myself), might find themselves searching for the end. I definitely got the point of the book pretty quickly and perhaps the last few chapters just didn't hold interesting enough subject matter because they were hard to get through. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to laugh and learn simultaneously. Hopefully you'll enjoy it at least as much as I did if not more.	2003-12-31

Well I finally had a copy of this book thrust into my hands and it took the Jaws of Life to get me to put it down.  This book has more truth and good old reporting in it then a month's worth of FOX news.  It is just an all around good book.   Just when you think you have read about the nastiest outrage you could think off, the author and his team dig a little deeper to dredge up one more outrage of the Bush jr. reign of terror.  I just can not say enough good about this book.   If you like the author, are a bit of a moderate to liberal or just a free thinking adult you will eat this book up.	2003-12-30

Al Franken manages to be articulate, eloquent and extremely funny all at the same time.  Rather each charge he makes of \\"Liar!\\" is backed up by well researched, specific examples of the lies they have told.  He skillfully illustrates how our supposed \\"liberal media\\" is, in fact, anything but (including statistics to back it up!) He shows us how Bush lied to us about who would benefit from his tax breaks (again with stats and sources that you can actually look up and - lo and behold - they are the same as he prints them in the book!).  It can make you laugh and laugh (all the Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly material, the story of meeting Barbara Bush) and then can almost bring you to tears (the story of what the Republicans did to the friends and family of Paul Wellstone after the memorial, what the Republican party did to Max Cleland, and the story of how many children will, in fact, get \\"left behind\\" due to all Dubya's cuts to education).

I would encourage anyone who hasn't read it to beg, borrow, or steal (well, maybe not steal) a copy because you owe it to yourself and your country to be better informed of the liberties taken my the media and how it affects us all.

In that respect I consider it a &quot;must read&quot;. Did anyone besides me notice the complete lack of charts or statistics when Franken discusses the 2000 election? Instead we get a fictional romance story. Al tries to be funny when he doesn't have the facts to support his beliefs. His attack on Bob Jones U and Christian morals in general is sad - Funny that his own son had too much integrity to participate. Also Al deceptively implies without actually stating that the entire trashing of the White House scandal was a complete fabrication by Carl Rove. Nice try Al, but anyone who has actually read the complete GAO report knows otherwise. But I'd suspect many of Franken's followers aren't bothering to check up on his lies. Yes Al, you are a bad liar.	2003-12-29

Many people are quick to criticize Franken, usually with one or two sentences and very little thought.  My review is a little different, however.  I actually read the book.<br />Franken sets his book up nicely by focusing on the so-called Liberal media.  He manages to prove, rather quickly, that there is no such thing.  He quickly decimates previous books by Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter by debating them point-by-point and offering proof to back up his point (somthing they rarely do).  In addition, he identify numerous lies perpetuated by the right wing and decimates them.  Franken is an expert at playing devil's advocate and looking at what the right might say in response to him before he decimates their lies.  Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and the entire Fox News staff are basically taken apart by Franken.  While it's hilarious and thought-provoking, it's also downright scary.  If you wish to believe that we still have a free press that is not run by the government, you might want to read the proof Franken has that today's media (specifically Fox News), is nothing but an extension of the Bush administration.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It's truthful, accurate, and will really make you think.	2003-12-27

Franken, as usual, points out the dishonesty in the arguments of the right wing. If you start reading the book thinking that right-wingers are merely people with bad judgement, you'll finish believing they are nefarious devils willing to tell any lie to get power.<br />&quot;Lies&quot; lacks a fifth star because, even though comedy is Franken's day job, the book isn't really that funny. Sometimes it's hard to tell when Franken is making a joke (a fact that may reveal as much about the conduct of his targets as it does about his style). Too much of Franken's comedy revolves around simple vulgarity, and his whimsical story about Republican draft-dodgers in Vietnam is unreadable. <br />That said, I still recommend the book highly to anyone with an interest in politics.	2003-12-27

In \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them\\", Al Franken becomes a left-wing version of the right-wing extremists he targets.  Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh -- meet your left-wing counterpart: Al Franken.<br />This book is cover-to-cover partisan ranting.  First of all, how do you write a book about Liars, and in it worship every word that comes out of Bill Clinton's mouth?  Bill \\"I didn't inhale\\" Clinton?  Bill \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\\" Clinton?  Hey,  I voted for the guy, but come on -- a little reality please.<br />I really gotta laugh, not because Al is funny, but because he is completely guilty of everything he accuses the republican / neo-conservative right-wingers.  At one point, he launches into a rant of how the neo-cons (and other similarly labeled individuals) are mean, but Al is guilty of the same sourness.  He plans a trip to Bob Jones University (BJU -- ok, that's funny) to make fun of a bunch of people with deeply moral / religious beliefs -- you know, like unmarried couples on a date need to be chaperoned to prevent immoral behavior.  Not that I have the same beliefs.  I don't!  But I don't plan trips to places where they congregate with like-minded folks to try to make fun of them.  The whole concept was a complete failure.  He even had to admit that everyone -- to a person -- that they met were extremely nice.<br />Later in the book, Al annoys Barbara Bush who is, by chance, on the same flight as he.  His whole approach to this nonsense is that because Mrs Bush doesn't wish to deal with him after he explains that he plans to use her son for material, then of course, she's mean.<br />Well, I guess as long as you're being mean to the other side, it's ok.<br />Last point.  Back when political satirists could actually produce material worth buying and reading, these political pieces used to cut into their target making a valid point and providing excellent entertainment.  Today, they're mindless rants.  Anyone can rant.  In the introduction, Al explains that if you're reading something that doesn't quite make sense to you, then it's probably a joke that you didn't get.  Well, thanks for blaming this material on your audience Al, but that's just not the way it is.<br />Was it interesting?  No.  Was it funny?  No.  Where's the satire?  I want my money back.	2003-12-27

George Bush uses friendly sounding names for programs that eliminate health, safety and environmental regulations that are poisoning our air and water including safeguards that protect us from things like Mad Cow disease.<br />George Bush is raping and looting our democracy and handing over the wealth and power of our nation to his richest friends and campaign contributors.  Recommend this book to friends and family and help take back our country in November, 2004.<br />There is no left wing bias in the media.  There is a right wing bias.  Our media outlets are owned by a small number of large corporations which benefit from spreading right wing propaganda and suppressing the truth.  Fox Lies - Scare and Dishonest reporting is a GOP infomercial.  Despite this, the majority of people who work in the media are liberal because they are better informed than most.   Al Franken reveals the lies.  To see how the rest of the media suppress the truth read \\"The Best Democracy Money Can Buy\\" by investigative reporter Greg Palast.

At first I thought it was going to be really boring and make me fall a sleep everytime I open it, but it was actually the complete opposite from the very beginning. I was not sure whether I was Liberal or Conservative but after reading this book and agreeing with Al now I know I am a Liberal and proud of it. This book was a funny piece of political writing and done in a very smart way. Al's arguments are done in a respectful, diplomatic and intelligent way. Which allows the flow of the book to run very smoothly for the reader to follow. Al uses the facts to dissect the lies that the right-wing or Conservative people have been telling America. The book itself was really entertaining. I enjoyed the comic &quot; The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus,&quot; in the back. It made issues clearer for me. Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One should be made into a short film it shows todays leaders as they truly are and how they really act. The part of the book that I enjoyed the most was &quot;Our National Dialogue on Terrorism.&quot; Because it is true about the way America feels about trying to understand the terrorists and why they do what they do. I shared that piece with my senior English class and eveyone felt that was the true outlook America has and we had quite the conversation on the subject. So if you are a Liberal or not quite sure read this book and you will know for sure.	2003-12-27

While critical of sloppy research by Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly we have Franken and company stating on page 146 that Sam Houston was killed at the Alamo (by ha ha Mexican Terrorists).  The battle for the Alamo took place in 1836, Sam Houston died in 1863 - I guess they just transposed the numbers.  Another item of poor research concerns the wounding of Max Cleland.  Sorry guys he did not lose his limbs because of a VC grenade; it was a US grenade that fell off another US soldier's equipment losing its pin and detonating while the men were getting on a helicopter.  <BR>I guess it is appropriate that we have a cover with Al Franken displayed next to the title &quot;Lies and and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.&quot;	2003-12-26

Yes, the vain clowns on a.m. radio who, surprise!, aren't so square with the listening public. But despite the impact these megalomaniacs have on political culture, can their advocates' opinions really be changed by Al Franken? And while the bugle call of ultra-nationalists like Coulter, Limbaugh and Hannity has resounded in American society since its inception, shouldn't these egoists be dutifully ignored rather than glamorized on book covers of their opposition? But a late chapter reveals why Franken's wrath is directed more at these nutcases than the one running the real show--turns out Franken had to humbly admit he initially supported the Iraq war, and even took a fun ride on the bandwagon bashing the Germans, the French, and the Dixie Chicks. Of course the said war--now proven completely unnecessary--makes America (and sorry, you too Al) seem even more like some big, dim-witted bully teeing off at anyone in range after someone just put gum on his chair. Jeez, you know just how far right your country has gone when a centrist like Franken is considered one of the left's foremost champions. Franken will likely run for office some day; sadly, this shows in his latest work. <BR>Moore's book is the more effective, but not just because of his steadfast vision and relative fearlessness. His research is far more essential, as it's directed at the true villains rather than their fear-laden, pom-pommed cheerleaders. One section--and one that's probably out of Franken's reach--beautifully articulates that while terrorism poses a virtual non-threat to one's safety, the hype of this ghost has allowed the radical right's agenda to haunt America nearly unchecked. Seems America has become the home of the cowardly, the wimpy--anyone but the brave. And the neocons know our penchant for getting easily spooked, and are poised to use this shortcoming to further dismantle the America we know and love. Amid all this, while uncovering lies of nutty pundits Franken-style is entertaining, it avoids the dredging of dark truths found in Moore's book--an exercise of far greater commitment, integrity and substance.	2003-12-26

With that said, I will say that I was surprised at how heavy handed Franken's humor was.

The blatant lies and distortions by numerous conservatives in positions of governmental and commercial power, all in an unashamed attempt to manipulate us smaller folk so they can have their way, must be fought with vigor and ridicule. It's likely someone cautioned Franken that, by soing so, he would be no better than those he has written about. And thinking this, I was reminded of a &quot;Taxi&quot; episode in which character Elaine Nardo (Marilu Henner) is given the ugliest of hairdos by an arrogant, high-pricing coiffeur (Ted Dansen). When she is about to dump a bowl of hairdressing goo on his head, she is stopped by Alex Rieger (Judd Hirsch) who says she would be stooping to Dansen's level and that she is better than that. But Louis DePalma (Danny DeVito) says he &quot;aint better than nobody&quot; and promptly upturns the bowl on Dansen. And that's how Franken comes across: he doesn't consider himself to better than anyone. He'd simply like everyone to know how they are being lied to from the other side. And he's done it. Thank you, Al.	2003-12-23

From that point, the book was mostly worthwhile. As a writer, Al Franken is not very good. He is crude, confused and confusing. As a comic writer, he is not very funny. I got literally one belly laugh and maybe two or three grins, but that was it. He obivously thinks a lot more of his talent than I do. His continued need to state how wonderful his corporate presentations are I suppose is done as humor but really suggests a sense of major insecurity, a need to justify himself. So be it. I don't recommend this book to anyone other that those interested in letting the hot air out of the evil Coulter's, O'Reilly's, Hannity's, Limbaugh's and other President Shrub operatives.	2003-12-22

Liberals nowadays are in much need of a popular commentator 1) to defend against the plethora of conservative criticism towards the left, 2) because not responding to the false accusations amounts to admittance. Franken carries out this role successfully with humor and rigor (he hired a team to verify sources of claims present in this book). I enjoyed the book, and even learned a point -- that one has to verify validity of each sentence *independently* so as to guard oneself from falling prey to sleight-of-hand tricks, which Franken asserts prevalent in recent political commentaries (again especially in Coulter's, O'Reilly's, Limbaugh's, and Hannity's arguments). However the book lacks a constructive view. It criticizes the right, but stops short from providing alternatives. For instance in my opinion the book would have been better if a comparison to the Democratic Party's monetary policies was included in addition to his criticism against Bush's tax cut proposal (even if the proposal didn't make any sense to begin with). The best part of the book to me was anecdotes of Franken confronting proponents of conservative propaganda. Those were hilarious in a profane way.	2003-12-22

I really liked Al Franken when he was funny.  I also liked Woody Allen when he was funny.  Problem is, neither of them are right now.  Allen just lost it.  Franken, sadly, decided to take on the mantle of Political Philosopher and Left-Wing Pundit.  Unfortunately, he isn't all that up to the task and, in all honesty, it's a sad waste of his considerable skills as a comic.<br />But, people buy his books in large numbers, perhaps out of thirst for a courageous liberal voice to stand up to the booming chorus from the right on conservative talk radio and an increasing number of cable news channels.  That thirst is understandable.  Right now, the drought of articulate, sensible politicians on the left is the worst I've ever seen.  Sure, we've got our share of Democrat attack dogs (like Howard Dean), but if you've watched even Dean in pointed interviews, he collapses.  Tim Russert turned Dean into mush in one recent appearance.  There is no reason for this deficit.  There are smart, articulate liberals out there, and on many issues, liberals hold the moral high ground.  But, Franken just isn't the right man for the job.  I'm not sure who is, but it's not him.<br />Franken's book takes a chapter from the right-wing kooks he critiques.  He is as selective in his facts and stories as Limbaugh, as defensive O'Reilly, as overbearing and kooky as Coulter.  Granted, he can be funnier, at times, than all three, but not here.  He's too busy pontificating than turning the witty phrase.  He goes for the lowest common denominator for humor, sadly.<br />The other thing he does is he fails to counter the most powerful conservative propaganda of all:  That the left doesn't have a point, they don't have a plan, they don't have an alternative.  I know this isn't true, but Franken all but proves me wrong.  And the problem, I think, is that like so many liberals, he doesn't have the courage to actually say what he really believes.  Why?  Because the liberal point of view is in the minority.  Always has been.  Except for support for government programs that pump out money and jobs, the core liberal principals just aren't in sync with most Americans.  And, as a result, many liberals have dropped them (Bill Clinton, the prime example--see, e.g., opposition to the death penalty, aggressive wealth re-allocation, opposition to prayer in school, aggressive equal rights programs), or don't speak about them.  These are unpopular views, but some of them are just plain right.<br />Sure, Franken effectively points out the self-proclaimed conservative spokespeople who play fast and loose--even pathologically, it seems, in some instances--with the facts.  No surprise there.  They are marginally trained windbags who are more entertainers than savants.  And none of them are serious journalists.  Is it any surprise that they'd get caught up in manufacturing a world that supports their ideology?  But there is just as much stuff that the lefties manipulate and get wrong--with some intentional misrepresentation to boot.<br />If you want a discharge of gas from the left as pungent and potent as that from the right, buy this book.  If you want a chuckle at the expense of being mean-spirited and downright nasty at times, buy this book.  But if you want someone who actually has a message, who won't stoop to the level of those he seeks to pillory, go elsewhere.  Where?

Franken convincingly shows what many liberals suspected all along:  The \\"liberal\\" media has many strong conservative factions, passing themselves off as either moderate or impartial.  Franken never hesitates to expose distortions, information taken out of context, and poor research, which Franken more bluntly characterizes as lies.<br />Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Fox News are targets for this expose', and Franken humorously, yet carefully documents why he claims they lie.  Alan Colmes, the left-wing foil to Sean Hannity is even skewered for being too meek and timid.  The book is laugh out loud funny in many places, but the material is complex enough to be mind expanding at the same time.<br />It also makes a convincing case that the Clinton administration was far more effective and understanding in dealing with terrorists, while the Busch administration was dismantling the United States defenses against terrorism, until September 11th forced the Busch administration to backtrack.  This was a surprising revelation to me, adding additional depth to Franken's critique of the right in general<br />It loses a star for being about 100 pages too long.  You should not feel bad about skipping a few of the chapters I didn't find to be funny or added little to the book.<br />This is one of those books where one's opinion of it says more about the person giving the opinion than the book itself.  So it should come as no surprise that I'm an unapologetic liberal.  Liberals will love this book.   Conservatives will probably hate it, but it should make them feel uncomfortable.	2003-12-20

Radical Liberals choose to express their dissatisfaction with the media and politics with anger.  They can not believe where the country stands and are angered by its leaderships decisions and direction.  Anger is not appealing to a moderate electorate.  Even if a situation in politics or the media is painful and distasteful getting angry at this only means to prod the wound as if to remind oneself that it is still present.  Franken chooses a different approach for his memoir on the current state of the media and politics.  Dabbing into anger only when absolutely necessary, only when Franken's chosen medium isn't enough..  Franken's medium is Humor.  Not to say humor doesn't achieve the same ends.  Robert Heinlein in his novel _A Stranger in a Strange Land_ once put humor as being a human development to cope with pain.  When something becomes so uncomfortable or distasteful or outright painful, you have to laugh at it.  If you get angry you only breed more pain.  Humor is the one way to cope with the lies, and discourse that the Right has so insidiously ingrained.  When the fate of the Nation can be decided by people who are either Liberal or Conservative, when the very foundation can be changed by people on either side, you have to do something to alleviate the pain that this can cause.  You have to laugh.  Right now Liberals have to laugh because all they see is the painful truth.  When the Right stops telling lies and start preaching the truth, it will be there turn to laugh.  When that happens Franken may need to change careers, or change idealogies, much to my dismay.	2003-12-19

This is a great book, meticulously researched and backed up by facts that you, yourself, the reader, can check.  Anyone with an open mind, who is willing to read both conservative and liberal books and pick the truth out of the lies on both sides, will be happy with this book.  <br />All of you who call Franken a liar, please point out exactly what you mean.  He took the time to cite his sources, to explain contexts (rather than take things out of context for political gain), and to document everything he did.  So where, exactly, is he making things up?  His entire point is that the conservatives he writes about (not all conservatives) distort what their sources say and/or simply do not give accurate examples of what they are talking about.  Those of you calling him a liar are doing exactly what he argues against--you're not giving any specifics about where he is wrong.  <br />Although I could do without the Chickenhawk stories, this book is funny, well written, and just plain excellent.	2003-12-17

I scanned through Bill O'Reilly's book and it was all double-spaced, thin, and short. Al Franken's book was tightly packed, thick, and substantial. I kid you not, I am totally serious! I would have bought Bill's book if it appeared to have any content. Meanwhile, Al's book had me laughing and at the same time amazed at the weird but true facts he and TeamFranken managed to dig up.<br />After reading \\"LIES\\", Hannity and Coulter are now more than entertaining  pundits. They are weird and scary representatives of a troubling side of America. Yes, I was laughing, but I am also scared that so many of my fellow citizens have forgotten or perhaps never learned what it means to be \\"the land of the free and the home of the brave\\". Instead, they run around afraid of anyone who doesn't attend their church.<br />But I digress. I found it somehow hilarious that \\"Colmes\\" always appeared in small font. I didn't get it right at first, but it had me howling when I caught on to the joke. But Franken can poke fun at himself, too. Check out that photo with John Glenn, when he was going to entertain the troops, it is just so goofy. Also, the entire BJ University thing was kind of embarassing and sad, but he still had the guts to tell the story. I came away with a much, much better opinion of Al Franken, and a gnawing fear in my gut that America is in need of a fresh and optimistic new direction.	2003-12-17

While you are trying to read something political, you can't take arguments seriously from someone who thinks debate should be about slander and crying and insulting like a big baby. <br />I felt nauseated every time I read the book, and it took a long time to read as I had to put it down so often for feeling slightly sick. His points didn't sink home with me, because I couldn't get past his condescending tone. He does not invite any sort of debate with what he says - he wants his words to be taken as gospel truth, and calls anyone who doesn't see things the way he does stupid idiots. While some of his points I understand or can see the humor in, others I don't agree with at all, and why would I want to read the words of a man who thinks I'm an idiot because I'm not with him 100% Do I want to be insulted every time I think his logic doesn't add up? No, and that made reading the book almost like a constant adventure in insulting myself, or allowing Al to insult me and other people every time I opened the book. <br />For the record, I consider myself a moderate, and that is the attitude I went into while reading the book. I come out of it thinking I'm downright unrepenting conservative. In part because I don't want to be put into any group that would find me rubbing shoulders with Al Franken.	2003-12-17

I have to give Al credit for selling a book just by a clever title.  His book on Rush Limbaugh, though now inaccurate due to Limbaugh's weight loss, grabbed attention just by its sheer rudeness.  <BR>  Now he takes on the entire right wing with his new book.  I mean, really, is it any big secret that politicians are lying to us?  Franken's real problem is that he paints just as broadly as those he attempts to indict.  The mark of a great political satirist (and there aren't many) is to point out the folly of our leaders/public figures without making us hate you while you do it.  Here Franken utterly fails.  <BR>  It's a real shame, however, because he's a bright guy.  He has, unfortunately, been brainwashed by his long relationship with academia and the entertainment business.  His prose, while sometimes attempting humor, always contains that sharp edge of liberal elitism that seems to imply that you are stupid if you don't agree with his opinion.  Save your money, and invest in a library card to check-up on our leaders yourself, instead of depending on a partisan who may need checking-up on himself.	2003-12-16

Al practices something these right wing hacks think is beneath them, something that has become almost obsolete in modern day political discourse: Checking the facts.  Whenever Al had a question, he would simply pick up the phone and ask away (no matter what side of the political fence they were on).<br /><br />You can put his END NOTES to the test and they'd pass.  He doesn't just take the first thing he sees from Lexis-Nexus and distort it to conform to his parallel view of the world.<br /><br />Through his painstaking research (and that of the 14 members of TeamFranken), Franken refrains from stating that Democrats are the \\"true patriots,\\" refrains from calling Republicans and/or conservatives \\"idiots,\\" and while he peppers his commentary with sarcasm, it's not \\"vituperative.\\"  He doesn't make baseless, childish accusations about the people who do not share his political viewpoints.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed his chapters on Ann Coulter and his touching tribute to his friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.  It was refreshing to get the truth about that \\"controversial\\" memorial from someone who was actually there and didn't just watch 2 minute clips on CNN and go on TV verbally assaulting everyone.  I also love the chapter about the \\"Blame America's Ex-President First Crowd.\\"  I'm sure that touched a nerve with frothing Clinton bashers everywhere.<br /><br />Once again, the right and their sheep have proven that they can dish it out but they just cannot take it.  We're very well aware that you people go through every positive review of a non-conservative book here at Amazon and give them negative ratings while repeatedly voting in the positive for Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly, ad nauseum.<br /><br />This should be required reading for anyone who wants to know the scoop on the draft dodgers and elitists that compose \\"conservative\\" political commentators.	2003-12-16

CNN also has become biased as they generally have been as positive toward Bush as they were negative toward Gore and Clinton. No one, not even conservatives can refute that Bush has generally received a positive spin from the media while Clinton was constantly bashed. 364 days a year we get these dubious polls and then one day a year the voters vote on voting machines owned by republicans, with constant propaganda from the entire media about how patriotic the republicans are and what losers the democrats are. This is what democracy has come down to in the 20th century. We have something like whitewater and clinton being given a blow job hyped into something criminal by the media. Then we have Bush being praised as supposedly an honorable man by the media, when in fact he is stealing from the poor and giving to the very wealthy. So Al Franken and the others who have in a humorous way criticized the right wing punditocracy that rules the land is to be commended for giving us some truth.

I found it to be surprisingly well written, well researched and just plain funny.  I liked it so much I've since bought 3 more copies to give as presents to friends.  There are a couple of chapters that are undeservedly mean or even just dumb, but the entire rest of the book is a biting but humourous response to the barrage of talking points repeated time and time again as unbiased commentary, and a spirited antidote to the nasty and abusive tone of discourse coming from certain elements of the conservative press.  Unlike Michael Moore, Franken gets his facts straight and most of his humor is right-on.  And as someone who thinks that using Christianity to support right wing economics is taking Jesus' name in vain, I think the chapter &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot; should be mandatory reading for all true Christians.

Franken manages to confront the conservative base with energy that matches their constant harangue against the left, but an underlying essence of compassion comes through in every chapter (I thought especially in \\"I'm a Bad Liar,\\" in \\"The Waitress and the Lawyer,\\" and in his discussion of \\"TeamFranken\\").  I was a bit disappointed in his willingness to use physical deformities as the subject of a joke--e.g. In chapter 13: \\"particularly inept guests like the man with the lazy eye and the speech impediment who's come on The Factor to demand rights for child molesters,\\" or chapter 23: \\"let's face it, you might be willing to alter wire service copy about a guy who has the power to force you to marry the gal in ad sales with a hump.\\" (Admittedly, the first is somewhat arguable--he could say he was just trying to define which guest--but the second example is really hard for me to excuse in such an otherwise excellent book.)  Nevertheless, it's an important book for the quality of the research, the warmth and humanity that comes through, and the brazen humor.	2003-12-15

Ironically, Mr.Franken got caught up in lie immediately after publishing the book. A lie that he responded to saying it was &quot;regrettable&quot; by citing a source that was made up. Liberal's look at this book as a bashing on O'Reilly and enjoy it because of O'Reilly's huge following. Yet, O'Reilly IS a political commentator and not a comedian. Naturally, he (anybody) will have a large following if he speaks to Americans critical mind. I'm sure all whom agree with the words of Franken also find the political commentary of people like Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Alec Baldwin, Danny Glover, etc. to be well thought out rationalization about politics in America. And if you believe that you probably also think that Bill Clinton was a moral man injected with family value's.

Why now?  You may ask.  Well I've read this book 2 or 3 times and have found that it is a great read.  It's often funny, more often than not insightful and if nothing else great food for thought.  The whole point of the book is to present arguments in a constructive (while at times hilarious) manner based on facts.  Sure there is satirical fiction in the book (operation Kitty Hawk) but it's obviously not supposed to be taken seriously.  But that's not why I'm writing.  So why the review?  I've been looking over these 1 and 2 star reviews written.  Specifically I've been looking for one of these reviews that actually has something to say other than call Franken names &quot;traitor&quot; &quot;liar&quot; &quot;commie&quot; &quot;ugly&quot; &quot;dweeb&quot; etc.   Guess how many of these eloquent reviewers actually backed up their claim that Franken is a liar. Zero!  None!  Zip!  My challenge to you who write these reviews and honestly just make nasty, petty, dim witted insults (if you don't belive me just look at the reviews) is to present the cases where Franken is lying.  What specific problems do you have with the book?  For God's sake just think or better yet do us all a favor and actually read the book before you start calling someone a commie traitor.  Is that to much to ask?  Can you all handle that?  Maybe take a page from Al and do some homework.  So you say he's a liar...PROVE IT!!  Just like Al did with your sacred cows O'reilly, Hannity and (Gasp!) coulter, Limbaugh, Cheney etc. etc.  Just make a tactful and factual argument (is that really to much to ask?)

I remember that name being superimposed at the bottom of the screen, \\"Al Franken\\", and laughing out loud.  That was some funny stuff.  Too bad he \\"peaked in the 70's\\" (to borrow a line from the late Phil Hartman).<br />So, why isn't he funny anymore?  Granted it's hard to top the, \\"yes it's me...Al Franken\\" bit, but I truly expected better.  So, he wants to write political books now.  So, he wants to take on O'Reilly, and other Right-Wing pundits.  That's cool, there sure is enough opportunity.  So why didn't he?  He spends a whole chapter telling how O'Reilly thought he won an award for a show it turns out he didn't?  WOW.  Hold the presses.  What is this, Jr. High?  I'm sure he can do better than this? His chapter on sex education was so lacking in basic common sense that I kept looking for the punch line.  Are we supposed to think abortions and teen sexually transmitted diseases are a good thing?  Is this what Liberals believe nowadays?  I find that hard to believe.  Nonetheless, when the only thing you can do is slam an idea that is sound because people fail to execute it, and then offer no suggestions of your own, you leave yourself open.  Franken does so here.<br />I think that his extended comic on \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" had some merit.  This is too bad, in that many are in fact corrupting the Faith for monetary gain.  So I will give him some credit for at least trying here.<br />Overall, I guess that if you are a liberal you will cheer this book, if for no other reason than he supports your worldview, but as an independent who doesn't agree with either Left or Right extreme offered, I just thought it was pretty ordinary and not very funny.  I miss the good ole days with the \\"yes it's me...Al Franken\\".  Can we get that back again?	2003-12-14

It's not his politics that I disagree with but his attitude. He's mean, petty, and lacks the compassion that liberals claim to possess but, sadly, almost never do. It's because of this mean-spiritedness that I find so typical in those who profess to care about the common man that I am reluctant to identify myself as a liberal, even though that's where I stand politically. Besides, Franken is a limousine liberal, a hypocrite who makes money from the very system he professes to find so unfair.	2003-12-13

It doesn't take a genius to point out these lies either.  <br />  the true genius of this book is in the humorous way in which he approaches these things.  the tone of the book is not one of anger.  he must have been smiling the whole time he was writing.  he is after the truth.  when he hears some outrageous claim from coulter or o'reilly he doesn't just believe it.  he looks it up.  he talks to people.  he learns things.<BR>  <BR>  and so we learn things.  we laugh.  we may grind our teeth at times, but it isn't franken that's making us mad.  its the facts.<BR>  <BR>  its funny that if franken really is lying so much in this book that he hasn't been successfully sued for slander as of yet.  coulter went to law school didn't she?  well i suppose she's still looking for some out of context remarks to use. <BR> <BR>  if you are conservative i wouldn't so much bother with this book unless you have an open mind.  i admit that i doubt i could get through a whole coulter or limbaugh book and i don't believe any truly rightwing people should subject themselves to this book.  they will be hurt and will lash out, but toward franken instead of their leaders who deserve it.  to open minded republicans with some sense of humor and democrats with a sense of humor this is a must have.  if you don't believe it all look some of it up.  it'll be fun.  it is fun.	2003-12-12

I'm glad my friend suggested I actually read his book and discover he isn't.<br />The book is a painful read because of the clarity with which he shows the horrible treatment good and decent people suffer at the hands of right-wing blow-hards.  From the simple and only slightly disturbing (like Rush's attack on 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton) to the much more disturbing analysis of the \\"liberal press\\" where he lined up the ammo for negative press on Gore (with all of his truthful statements that were interpreted as lies--the Internet comment for one) with the much less common negative press for Bush even though he actually did lie or have his talking heads lie for him (like when he was pulled over for driving too slowly when he actually crashed into a hedge while driving drunk).<br />Unlike right-wing books from hacks like Hannity, Coulter, and O'Really (sic), this book is backed up with real facts.  He doesn't try to stick in a few near-truths (or complete untruths) to make his points.  He respects his readers a little too much for that.  Although his research is painstaking (he had the help of a crew of Harvard undergrads), he interjects a bit of humor from time to time to make sure the painful lessons are not unbearable.<br />This book will make you both laugh and cry.  Only a comedian could tell it like it is without driving us to depression.	2003-12-11

I began reading this book which basically tells me that &quot;the right&quot;, whatever that is, are a bunch of liars... and he's so mean about it. It reminds me of the cruelty of children, on the playground.

I look at who they are and make my decision.<br />This book makes me not want to vote at all. Who can you trust when you have liars on one side, and liars on another? It hurts my head to think that politics is this dirty. I wish it wasn't but people who have to make their points by belittling others has their own issues. Some of it was funny, I can't lie. So I gave it three stars. But I don't like this guy's method of making his point. It's just too mean for me. I know this probably didn't help anyone, so go ahead and click on how it didn't.

Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad.&quot; This statement sums up Al Franken's point of view, and his method of expressing it --- it's a simplistic way of describing the difference between liberals and conservatives, but then it has to be. After all, Al Franken is a comedian. To make you laugh, he has to simplify things, keep them quick and entertaining, and poke fun at the right wing's worst moments.<br />He starts off with Ann Coulter's well-documented lies from her books and editorials. He moves on to Rill O'Reilly, showing that O'Reilly lied about his awards and where he grew up. His chapter on Sean Hannity includes the infamous chart that covers up Reagan's tax-and-spend policies. The chapter on the Paul Wellstone Memorial is the least funny, but the most important. Al Franken is really upset about how conservatives twisted the heartfelt sentiments expressed at the memorial.<br />Halfway through the book, he shifts gears. He returns to his &quot;Chickenhawk&quot; tale from his Rush Limbaugh book, adding new characters. He writes about infiltrating Bob Jones University and attending the White House Correspondents Dinner. He adds in a one-act play and even a comic book about Jesus. The examination of lies slows down in the second half, but the shift to personal stories keeps your interest.<br />If you want a careful analysis of the lies on the right, there are plenty of other books you can read after this one (like Joe Conanson's new book). If you start here, you won't regret it.	2003-12-11

Not being an American and thus neither right wing, left wing, liberal, republican or middle of the road joe I found this book to be pretty interesting. If even half of what the author claims in this book is true it is a shocking indictment to the much of the American media, Politicians and institutions.  The book is witty and amusing and even though I don't know half the people mentioned in the pages I found myself with some stark images of their personas with Frankens descriptions.<BR>My main gripe with this book though is the title which claims to be a &quot;fair and balanced look....&quot;, which I would have to say is not.  Throughout the pages there are many lies and liars exposed in a fairly sarcastic and condesending manner, which Franken seems to enjoy (and I admit, I did too).  But Franken is just too pro Clinton for my liking and in titling a book &quot;....fair and balanced...&quot; I would have liked to see a more balanced approach in some of his comments.  Whilst I would agree to a certain extent that Clinton was an excellent President for the US it doesn't seem quite right to me to sing his virtues over and over again and seemingly 'forget' the scandals that affected him throughout his Presidency.  I would recommend this book, certainly for Frankens humour alone but if your looking for a truly balanced view of American politics and policies then perhaps you should look somewhere else.	2003-12-11

My wife and I listened to the audiobook of Franken's latest book on the way to Omaha this Thanksgiving. Franken's delivery features his typically sacastic and sometimes smug deameanor, but is largely entertaining... that is if you can be entertained while learning about how blatantly the right wing media and their minders in D.C. consistently deceive the public by twisting and, oftentimes, fabricating the truth to suit their political aims. Franken's drops a big ol' bunker-buster of facts on these slimy snakes and rousts them out of their caves of lies. With each passage, you feel initially amused, but then thinking &quot;Hey! That is downright sickening!&quot; When we arrived in Omaha I was frothing at the mouth to grab the first Republican relative I could find and rip him a new one. My wife talked some sense into me. But if that's the kind of reaction you're looking for in your political satire or if you are a Right Winger that wants some truth with your media, try this one on for size.	2003-12-10

I spent a few minutes just now, however, looking at other people's reviews, and I have to say that I am dumbfounded.  The people who wrote bad reviews on here are remarkably illiterate:  Their rantings are short, with most reviews a few words in length.  None of the reviews I've read provide any details as to why Franken's book wasn't worth their time, just the kind of name calling that most right wingers resort to when their reactionary views collapse under scrutiny: \\"worthless punk,\\" \\"pure crud\\", \\"foul mouth fool\\", \\"low life\\", \\"lying basketcase\\", \\"Moron\\" (all of these provided, amazingly, in one short rant by a particular reviewer, who nevertheless is unable to dispute any part of Franken's book), and names from other people so blatantly racist that I won't repeat them.  Those attacking Al's book strictly on the grounds of his political leanings or his ethnicity are about as classy as the people who Al criticizes in his book.

The only source, of the three, that even existed was a NY Times article which was quoting a web page of a fanatical leftist from San Francisco.

He goes after O'Reilly on a number of levels.  The 2 Peabody awards turned out to be a Polk, which the tabloid show Inside Edition was awarded _after_ O'Reilly left the show.  Afterwards, O'Reilly falsely accused a journalist of lying when he exposed the story (and as Franken points out, its somewhat ironic that the award was a _journalism_ award).  Everyone makes mistakes, weasels lie about them.<br />O'Reilly also compared the Koran to Mein Kampf (and then lied about having done so), lied about his party affiliation, lied about where he grew up, and repeatedly gives false statistics to support his arguments (claiming that they're dead accurate).<br />And the wonderful picture of O'Reilly on the cover (and the lawsuit it sparked) is worth the price of the book alone.	2003-12-08

Calling All Americans to stand up to this left-wing hypocrisy thats infiltrated our young minds!!!

Clinton was a lying lyar too, and although Franken acknowledges this, I think he presents a prettier picture of him than he deserves. There are plenty of negative reviews in this thread, which amount to little more than the whining they accuse Franken of.  Not one has anything resembling a scholarly refutation.  Michael Moore is biased for sure and shouldn't really be grouped with Al Franken.  It's a good light read and well worth the time.	2003-12-08

I note that one reviewer pointed out the otherwise trivial details of how Ol Wild Bill O'Reilly was painted a liar. I have to agree that the fact Wild Bill lied about where he was reared, lied about being a Republican, lied about winning a Peabody Award for Inside Edition(isn't that a hoot), and the other lies he told weren't exactly earth shattering in the grand scheme of things. However, that is the whole point. Franken is making the point that these right-wing idealogues engage in this very technique on a fairly routine basis. In other words, they  take a rather small irrelevant assertion of fact and completely blow it our of proportion to its value and then exclaim that an individual is a liar. He gives some excellent examples of just how this technique was used extensively by right-wing idealogues when attacking Al Gore. I do note that when these same techniques are used against the very right-wing idealogues, i.e. Ol Wild Bill, that created the technique they become enraged. A perfect example of that is when Ol Wild Bill started screaming at Franken at a joint appearance in which Franken was promoting his book. So I would certainly recommend this book and would hope people could read it with a little more understanding of its basic premise than some of the reviewers.	2003-12-08

Unlike books by his &quot;colleagues&quot; such as Ann Coulter, Al Franken does a painstakingly thorough and well-researched opinion peace with the wit we've come to expect from the former SNL writer (I still remember and love that Colossal President skit, Al!). For liberals, it will not only seemingly re-affirm everything you know, but also open your eyes to some scary realities (such as those outlined in the Operation Ignore chapter). For conservatives, it will just give you more reason to spew your disgust at everyone who doesn't agree with your pathetic ideologies. However, this tends to be true of most liberal books and, in all fairness, vice-versa for most right-wing books too. <br />Like most left or right-wing books, the favorable reviews in this section are filled out by those who are on the same side of center as the author, most of whom have probably read the book, and the negative ones are filled out by those who are on the opposing side, most of whom have probably not read the book. So it should come as no surprise that I share Franken's political views and have read the book.<br />What Franken exposes here is the hypocricy, contradictions and flat-out lies conservatives like that kneecap with hair Ann Coulter tell. Only unlike Coulter and Bill O'Reilly, Franken goes to great lengths to prove his work. He not only cites his facts (almost all of which are from highly reputable sources), but has not been afraid to go straight to the source when he cannot find the desired information through conventional means (see the Evan Thomas interview). Despite Al's advice to the contrary, I read &quot;Treason.&quot; I can't really justify this action, other than to say it had been a long night of drinking and I needed to induce vomitting. The contrasts between the two books are, in my mind, indicative of the contrasts between the hard right and the left. Whereas Treason was factually distorted and hate-filled, Lies was methodically factual and morefrustrated than hate-filled, although Franken's dislike for many conservatives is as thinly veiled as the right's hatred for ideological opposition. Overall, an outstanding read for any educated individual who can read a well written book objectively. By the way, Al...if you're ever looking for members for TeamFranken, give me a shout!	2003-12-08

That was the only way that the Dreyfus affair could be cleared up once and for all.

Unforunately, Mr. Franken has fallen into the trap the he so artfully sets for those who disagree with his political philosophy.  The lies he purports being sold are what those who disagree with him would call truths liberals and Democrats hate to admit.  It is another example of how people have no concern for the common good, only that which is good for them.  I consider myself objective, educated (an MD), and open to many different opinions, but have trouble with those who refuse to even consider a different opinion has merit.  The so called lies and liars are people who are finally fed up with the likes of Mr. Franken, Michael Moore, etc, who still can't get over the fact that in increasing numbers, people find the views of those still hung in the late sixties mode and who have found themselves in the position of political leaders (whom they used to despise) as destructive, obstructive and over-the-hill.  This is not to say that all conservatives are correct, but the worn out rhetoric that anyone other than the elite in entertainment have no intelligence or ability to form educated opinions that disagree with the liberal philosophy is now past its prime and generally disrespectful.  These so called elite carry little in the way of experience to back up their flawed philosphy, it just sounds warm and fuzzy, but fails to address the issues the so-called liars at least have the courage to bring to the general debate, and not cloak in so-called objective reporting.  In short, Mr. Franken shouldn't quit his day job.	2003-12-06

There seem to be a lot of knee-jerk reactions to nearly everything that is said about politics, the economy, the war(s), the environment, and the personalities of our leaders. Too bad that so few people are carefully assessing what is true or false about these statements. And too bad that so few people have a clue about WHY they have knee-jerk reactions. I suspect that it's largely because of one or two deeply ingrained prejudices or notions: if it seems as if anyone is opposed to \\"our thing\\" (be it \\"equal opportunity\\" or \\"right to life\\" or \\"right to choose\\" or our \\"God-given right to carry a hidden assault weapon\\" or whatever), we just freak out and want that person silenced some way. Why do so-called blue-collar people support Repubicans? Probably because they don't notice they're getting financially screwed (or don't care as much about that) as long as (a) \\"people of color\\" are screwed even worse and (b) nobody takes away their guns (or their \\"right\\" to pray in school). Why do they NOT support Democrats? Probably because the term \\"Liberal\\" is krazy-glued onto them by the GOP, and THAT is code for (a) people who give equal treatment to African Americans and Hispanics, etc., and (b) people who are going to support gun control (or oppose prayer in school). (BUT WAIT: even Ronald Reagan supported gun control after he left office, and don't blame it just on \\"old-timer's disease.\\")<br /><br />So--I'm from Long Island (born here, left, served in the army,  worked in Kansas, and came back 27 years ago). It's the place where Bill O'Reilly CLAIMS he was born in a blue-collar town. That is ONE of his lies, and one that Franken documents in humorous fashion. O'Reilly's silver-spoon background is clearly laid out for us--as are other shady aspects of this pundit's life and doings.<br /><br />O'Reilly is just one of many who are exposed as liars by Franken and his \\"team\\" of young researchers--who will probably be black-balled for life by the big businesses who fill the GOP's coffers with soft money for favors (\\"the finest legislation money can buy\\"). To me, the biggest eye-opener is how the WALL STREET JOURNAL's editorial page is full of self-serving lies. I'd always thought they were a reliable paper, albeit one that fosters greed by focusing people's attention on their stock portfolios. (Anyone else besides me believe that the reason stock values went UP last month is because of costs being cut--by cutting jobs? Who is responsible? The Clintons?) Franken, among much else, points out a lot of eye-opening stuff about income and what kinds have been taxed and what kinds have not. A lot of it was news to me. Dare to find out?<br /><br />One of the saddest and most moving chapters in Franken's book is how the so-called Right ganged up and lied about the tribute to Paul Wellstone. If you think Franken is merely about laughs, try THIS chapter. AND try reading or viewing his sources.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a very useful book to \\"the choir.\\" They can feel pleased that somebody besides Michael Moore is paying attention and getting the word out about the ways America is being sold out from within while the public sleeps. It is, sadly, not a useful book for convincing anyone who isn't already a believer. Witness the many one-star \\"reviews\\" on this website: clearly they have (a) not bought the book and (b) not read anyone else's copy. They have just gone nuts and logged on to dis it 'cause they think it's a danger to their way of thinking. And they are right--it is. But NOT in the way they fear. It might just O-P-E-N their eyes, their minds, and (dear me) their hearts to something new. And for people who shut down these three things at age 12 (when they were convinced they knew everything worth knowing), that IS pretty scary.<br /><br />Let me issue a challenge to one or two of the One-Stars: look up Franken's sources and write a refutation of what you find. That, when I see it, will open up MY eyes and mind and heart, and I will welcome you to THINKING PERSON LAND. Sound too snobbish?

It's easy to see why Franken has been a reasonably successful comedian after reading this book.  It is exceptionally entertaining.  There are few moments where mirth is not lurking in the background.  I do think this book was a bit of preaching to the converted but it has an entertainment value that should be considered as well.  If one cares for a deeper look at who controls the media and why a worthwhile book would be Noam Chomsky &amp; Edward Herman's Manufacturing Consent.  It is the finest work of media analysis for the purpose of determining prejudice in coverage that has been written.<br /> The depth of the research here is not particularly impressive but is factual and consistent.  Franken is honest about himself but not always about the party he is rooting for.  Al Gore, who apparently is the second-best thing to happen the United States after Bill Clinton, has been taken to task by The Nation and CorpWatch for his shoddy environmental record, especially, his going to bat for Occidental in its quest for drilling rights.  His record it, to be clear, better than George W. Bush's.  Much better actually.  However it's a long ways from good enough.  Or take his support of the war in Kosovo.  Every responsible analyst realized that Serbia would escalate the violence in Kosovo if an attack was initiated.  Commanding General Wesley Clark said that it was &quot;entirely predictable&quot;.  The U.S. did nothing when Milosevic took away Kosovo's autonomous status in 1989.  Nor did we show regret at having sold out the Kosovars at the Dayton peace talks in 1995.  Clinton did nothing in November-December of 1996 when 250,000 Serbs rose against Milosevic.  He acted just in time to escalate the violence in Kosovo.  If one learned about it from this book alone, one might think that was not the case.  Of course Clinton too, has a better record than W., but that really isn't saying much.<br /> It's kind of hard to see how Mr. Franken misses the boat on these things.  He rightly condemns the fact that the US has backed countless murderous dictatorships but then he supported a war that was certain to make one of them even more horrible.  He rightly condemns himself for supporting the war in Iraq but not for the right reasons.  He seems to think that a nation that poses no feasible threat to the United States can be invaded because it possesses awful weaponry.  How about India?  Pakistan?  Israel?  France?<br /> Other than those two glaring poop-stains, the book is solid and entertaining.  The fictionalized story about the Vietnam unit is priceless.  His review of the media reaction to the funeral of Paul Wellstone is excellent.  The book is an entertaining and fairly informative work by a comedian with keen political insight.  It would make an excellent companion to a subscription Extra! although admittedly, F.A.I.R. can't approach Mr. Franken in the humor department.	2003-12-05

But that's not enough. It is one thing to complain about the bad situation of the US, from a \\"liberal\\" perspective, by highlighting lies of non-liberal liars. It is another to do something about it. In other words, Iraqi and Afghani people continue to die and suffer under the illegal US occupation, while Franken and O'Reilly exchange courteous insults, making money over the head of naïve readers.<br />Because, if those people whom Franken mentions did lie as he says they did - and I have no reason not to believe him - instead of being exposed, they should be brought to justice and tried for crimes against mankind. The US set a great precedent with the Nuremberg trials of the late 40's, and there is no reason the procedure couldn't be used against rulers of the US itself, which is the only country of the world that has been formally accused internationally of terrorism, thanks to the indictment by Nicaragua. But it seems Franken would chicken out at that idea, because he seems to believe that changing from a Republican to a Democratic administration would fix everything. It would not, since many of the crimes for which the US is known internationally have been committed under Democratic administrations, as the shortened list of Korea, Santo Domingo, Vietnam, Indonesia, Greece and Cuba illustrates.<br />Franken seems to believe that Republicans are the source of all lies, while Democrats are the center of honesty. But if that were so, why don't Democrats use the golden opportunities offered by President Bush's lies - described by Franken - to impeach him several times over? Why did they support all those illegal wars, lastly that in Iraq, and swallow all those lies and hoaxes about WMD, uranium from Niger,  and Saddam's involvement in the Twin Tower massacre? Why did they agree over and over again to new war expenditures and mendacious tax cuts? Why don't they support US troops by sending them home IMMEDIATELY?<br />Franken also says that Clinton was the greatest president of the twentieth century. If so, why didn't he stand up to the indignity of being tried for impeachment for reasons that made the US the laughing stock of the whole world? Why did he not say, I refuse to answer such questions and I appeal to all people to condemn such repulsive behavior by hypocrite Republicans? Maybe because he was too busy watching polls, instead of standing up like a man! I imagine Louis XIV looking down at modern kings and shaking his head at the low level at which, in the name of democracy, present world leaders are held accountable for their personal behavior, with asinine accusations, that neither he nor Mitterand could even think of!, while Kennedy and Roosevelt behaved as they pleased. <br />Now, maybe Clinton is not a hardened criminal like the current president, but among others he illegally bombed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, a fact which, aside from the immediate casualties of a few thousand deaths, is believed to cause the death of about 100,000 people, among the poorest on earth, depriving them of needed medicines. Enough to put him in the list of war criminals, together with several past US presidents, secretaries of state, generals and the like.<br />The fault might be with the title \\"a fair and balanced look at the right\\". In fact it is neither fair nor balanced and represents a back-door, sneaky rationale to give some kind of legitimacy and respectability to outright liars and crooks (read: the \\"nice\\" people at Bob Jones, who teach creationism in the 21st century!). Which shows the limits of  those \\"liberals\\" a-la-Franken: willing to complain about distortions of the system, but not to recognize that there might be an inherent flaw in how this new \\"version\\" of the system has been built lately, with heavy contributions by the Democrats. Let's see instead what the US Declaration of  Independence states: \\"...That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends [those of the rights of the Citizen], it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\\". <br />This is long overdue in the US, as in many other \\"democratic\\" countries, after decades, if not centuries, of abuses of mankind, both inside the borders and on a world scale, as the present crimes by the US and Great Britain eloquently indicate. Americans should do better and listen to a scream that has been heard worldwide for several decades: \\"yankee, go home\\", and demand immediate closure of all those imperial military bases worldwide, on foreign soil, which have served to perpetrate so many crimes, from Guantanamo to Sicily passing through the Pacific. Even though Franken seems to be deaf on that one!<br />To conclude, in spite of the apparent accuracy and funny style of the book, the reader is better off learning about those lies from more serious and impartial activists and researchers like Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Scott Ritter, Gore Vidal and Paul Krugman.	2003-12-04

I only got the book (the unabridged audio CD version) to pass time on the 10-hour-plus drive from school in Grinnell, IA to home in Louisville, KY.  As an avid viewer of Fox News and an avowed fan of Bill O'Reilly (I have read and reviewed all three of his non-fiction books) and the No Spin Zone, despite my disagreements with this loud-mouthed know-it-all on so many issues, I couldn't avoid the hype of Franken and his book, so I figured I would secretly succumb when no one could see me.<br />I remembered the good old days when Al Franken was nothing more than a second-tier comedian on Saturday Night Live.  I certainly didn't expect a political masterpiece from him, but was amazed that this is exactly what I found.  The breadth and depth of his political knowledge, his wit, his biting sarcasm, and his cynicism towards politics is impressive.<br />Piece by piece he nips away at the dishonest and intrigue with which the right surrounds itself.  He gives credit where credit is due, but holds no punches in going after George Bush, Karl Rove, Bill Bennet, Anne Coulter, Rush Limbaugh (I can't wait to hear what Franken will say about the drug addiction) Fox News, et al.  Rather than expounding on a vast right-wing conspiracy, he simply responds to their assertions.  I don't agree with him on everything (I do believe there is a liberal media bias), but he argues with vigor and honesty.  He knows the issues (unlike many of his opponents) and does not patronize the audience.<br />He certainly could not have succeeded without his impressive team of all-star Harvard researchers.  They deserve as much credit as he does.<br />Even if one looks at this book through a conservative lens, one cannot avoid feeling changed by it.  Yes, he falls victim to some of the same biases he despises (his look at the right is neither fair, nor balanced... he seems to think they are all evil, greedy, racist, homophobic, hegemonic liars,and that liberals are saints), but at least he is honest in his arguments.  This shouldn't be the only book one reads, but it is an authoritative response to dozens of conservative books.  And this one book probably beats them all, point-by-point.<br />This is definitely a guy I would like to have over for dinner someday.  Perhaps when Gephart becomes President, I will see him at the innauguration.  ;-)	2003-12-03

After reading the reviews of those who gave the book one star, it was clear that they didn't mention any of the content of the book compared to those (liberal or conservative) who did and gave it four or five stars. As for those who critisized the title 'Fair and Balanced View of the Right' for not being fair and balanced let me point out Mr Frankens canny use of irony, in relation to the fair and balanced news reporting of Fox. You see, right from the cover he is being satirical. This book is a great read and much better than the resonable Michael Moore latest.	2003-12-03

This is why it is such a great read. It also looks at specific instances in which conservative public personas such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly, among others, have been called out for intentional lying and periods of time in which they displayed pure ignorance. For example O'Reilly claims how he came up from nothing, living in the poor village of Westbury when in fact he lived in the upscale Levittown. When he caught with this lie he said it was the Westbury section of Levittown. Al pointed out, \\"There is no Westbury section of Levittown. They are two separate villages several miles apart. It was like saying he had grown up in Brooklyn- the Manhattan section of Brooklyn.\\"(Pg. 74) I really enjoyed the realness of the book. It was more like you were listening to stories from the hilarious Franken in person rather than reading another boring analysis of the situation. Franken used specific instances with Coulter saying she was friendly with Franken when they had encountered each other once to display how freely some conservatives in media lie. I liked how the book skipped from topic to topic in each new chapter. Each chapter became a new opportunity for Franken to enlighten us into the lies we hear that we'd never check and would assume that all journalists just spoke the truth. <BR> This book's theme is that there is no liberal slant in media but rather more of a conservative one overall. Franken admits that on some issues there is more liberal views among journalists but the networks and media overall is more conservative. I think his view is very interesting and do believe he has a legitimate point. I personally am a conservative but am open to the truth no matter who it comes from. He has pointed out instances in which there are no way to avoid that the media has had more conservative bias. He used the past presidential election to show how more negative press went to Gore than Bush which is contradictory to the way it would be with a liberal bias. The media is all around us. It relates to my life because I'm rather trusting of the media and when points made in this book are revealed it shows me some times you can't believe everything and need to take a second look at what you've been told. I don't want to look ignorant due to the fact I just believed what I heard from media without looking into it myself.<BR> I would definitely recommend this book. The book is a fun read. I'd recommend it because it points out legitimate views using Franken's comic personality to lighten the mood. Before you read it is important to keep an open mind and to get whatever you can from it.	2003-12-02

BUT, that being said, you can't help but enjoy Mr. Franken's clear glee with the task at hand. With excellent research Mr. Franken pokes fun at a few who take themselves entirely too seriously.

Lies mixes biting satire with plenty of factual insights into the flaws of many of the popular leaders of the right. Mr. Franken is most successful with the chapters that combine this satire with insights into either the facts neglected by the Right Wing Commentators or the errors in their logic. The factual portions of the book are well documented and appear to be carefully checked --generally consistent with information from other sources and the failure of any of Mr. Franken's critics to rebut more than the most trivial issues. <br />The one weakness of lies is the regression into somewhat juvenille humor in a couple of chapters -- particularly the &quot;Operation ChickenHawk.&quot; This chapter creates a hypothetical wartime scenario with John Kerry and several right wingers who had never served in the military (&quot;hawks&quot; who were chicken).	2003-12-01

He tries to stick to the facts, and unlike Coulter, he doesn't spend that much time name calling (though it does happen here and there). He generally backs up what he says and doesn't get too rabid. I'm not saying I agree or disagree with everything he says, but he does try to keep it fair.

While I trumpet much of what Franken has to say, I don't give this book much more credit than many of the polemics that have cropped up on both sides of the political knife. While I give Franken decent marks for doing his homework and think his research is much sounder than many on the right, my main problem with this book is that it can only divide the populace. Its spirit is very much in line with the right's venomous attacks in print, lead by the vituperative Ann Coulter with the obvious difference being that he is attacking from the other side of the coin. Books such as this simply raise the price of mud.<BR>     Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe mudslinging is the vogue weapon of 21st century politics. I can certainly attest that George W. has angered me more than any other president of my time. Maybe the left needs its own shrill voices and we should elevate the Frankens and Michael Moores within the political demolition derby. Is there a large swath of people out there who only react to this type of book and will only be swayed by the sharp and pointed ends of attack words?

This book is a collection of commentaries on various aspects of the right wing, including the right's allegation of liberal bias, his &quot;friend&quot; (her word) Ann Coulter, the unaccredited Bob Jones University, and other topics.  Some chapters are heavily documented, while others are more personal storytelling.  Throughout, he keeps up a lively, comic tone.<br />One chapter, available in Amazon's excerpt, comments on the right's allegation of liberal bias in news media.  His contention is that the bias is toward sensationalism and avoidance of offense to news organizations' corporate parents -- in general toward making news profitable -- rather than any bias left or right.  He points out that the media was in a feeding frenzy over the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, which fits the idea of ratings-motivated bias better than pro-liberal bias.  He also contrasts media reaction to blunders in the first Gore-Bush debate in 2000.  Gore's mistake was saying he had visited a disaster site with a FEMA director, when he had actually visited 17 other disaster sites with him but not that one.  Bush's blunder was claiming, &quot;By far, the vast majority [of a tax cut] goes to people at the bottom,&quot; when the bottom 60 percent got 14.7 percent of the cut.  Franken wrote that Gore's slip-up drew widespread media commentary, while Bush's lie or mistake drew almost none; Franken speculated that the media took Bush as too stupid to deserve criticism on statistical details.<br />He contends that the mainstream media, however strong their ratings bias may be, maintain a left-right balance.  By contrast, he notes that the media includes a committed right wing branch, including Fox News, the editorial pages of the _Wall Street Journal_, and most talk radio.  His position is that the right wing media goes beyond editorializing, and sometimes plainly lies, then accuses the mainstream media of liberal bias when their lies are exposed.<br />His Ann Coulter chapter, also excerpted on Amazon, notes that she said she was &quot;friendly with&quot; Franken in an interview, although the entire extent of their acquaintance was being briefly introduced at a party, where he was polite to her.  He examines her 780 footnotes, pointing out that they're actually endnotes, and finds that they often demonstrate her main text as misleading or baldly lying.  He sticks to the comic tone, while showing that her endnotes are evidence that she's misrepresenting facts, and hiding the lies by putting them in endnotes, which few readers bother to examine.<br />I also read his chapter about his visit to Bob Jones University, an unaccredited institution famous for its ban on interracial dating (only recently lifted), its strong enforcement of its vision of Christianity, and other ideologies.  His visit was designed to test whether stories of its hostility toward other types of Christianity (such as Roman Catholicism), anti-Jewish attitudes, and racism were justified.  With a college-age confederate, he visited the campus, pretending interest in the school, and saying that the student's mother admired the school's values.  Surprisingly, no one recognized Franken as a television comic and author until near the end of the day.  He said they had fun watching school officials squirm when asked about the school's lack of accreditation and absence in a book of quality schools.  But their overall impression was that while the people they met seemed committed to a narrow-minded branch of Christianity, they were also constantly polite and often seemed genuinely nice.  That surprised them; they had expected a campus full of hate.<br />While the main focus of the book is debunking the claim of liberal media bias, and poking fun at the right wing branch of the media, he includes stories like the Bob Jones University visit that stray far from media issues, though still related to the right.  He maintains a sense of humor throughout the book, and the book should be worth laughs even to people whose ideology he mocks.  Liberals should enjoy the book a great deal, and conservatives should get a good laugh out of it too, even if they're infuriated at Franken's laughs at their leaders' expense.<br />Liberals, buy the book, put some money in Franken's pocket, and get a good laugh.  Conservatives, borrow the book, get mad at Franken for making fun of your heroes, and get a good laugh too.<br />My impressions are based on reading only a few chapters of the book, which I did to compare five current political books.  The others were _Bushwhacked: Life in George W. Bush's America_, by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose, _Dude, Where's My Country?_ by Michael Moore, _Who's Looking Out for You?_ By Bill O'Reilly, and _Slander: Liberal Lies about the American Right_ by Ann Coulter.  This one and _Bushwhacked_ were the best of the bunch.  This one funnier and more entertaining to read, but Ivins and Dubose's was more focused and heavier on detailed research.  Moore's was mildly amusing, but heavy on name-calling and not nearly as fun as his movies.  O'Reilly's seemed like little more than a compilation of his newspaper editorial columns, and was deadly boring -- like Moore, O'Reilly is much more effective on-screen than in print.  Coulter's was by far the worst; it was little more than a lot of hateful name-calling, misleading footnotes, without even the sense of humor that made Moore's name-calling amusing.	2003-11-29

It's been seven years since &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot,&quot; Al Franken's first book lampooning right-wing punditry, hit bookstores.  A lot can happen in seven years:  the Clinton Impeachment.  The 2000 Election.  9/11 and its aftermath.  Even the Wellstone plane crash and its aftermath.  As each of these events paraded across our headlines, I found myself thinking, &quot;Al Franken wrote his book too soon!&quot;  You should know, dear Amazon.com reader, that I work in a bookstore.  (The old-fashioned kind, not the virtual one you are using right now.)  As such books as Sean Hannity's &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; and Ann Coulter's &quot;Slander&quot; crossed my path, I would pray, &quot;God, tell Franken to get off of his rear and write another book about right-wing demagogues!&quot;<BR>     God must have heard me, because as Franken tells it in the introduction to his new book, God assigned him the task of writing &quot;Lies (and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;).  Up to the challenge, Franken comments on everything I've listed above, using his trademark combination of well-researched facts and dry wit.  Once again, Franken uses comic devices one would expect from the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; veteran, including short plays and cartoons.  (For &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot; fans who want to know how the saga began, there is a prequel.)  However, my favorite paassages are the ones where Franken quotes conservative authors, takes their words apart and puts them back together with his amusing spin.  When he does this, Franken does more than entertain us:  he gives us a needed refresher course in reading.  Al teaches us these lessons:  don't take everything you read (or hear) at face value.  Analyze it and fight the demagogues with humor!  When Hannity cites the fact that Clinton's military budget used less tactical aircraft than Reagan's as proof that Clinton &quot;gutted our military,&quot; remind him that Reagan used less horses than Lincoln!<BR>     At the end of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,&quot; after the villain returns to full strength, the young hero encourages a pair of wise-cracking, practical-joking twins to keep doing what they do best.  Perhaps Harry (or his creator, J.K. Rowling) remembers something easily forgotten:  the more grim the world seems, the more important it becomes to have a sense of humor about it.  Fortunately, I have never been forced to compete in a rigged tournament so that an evil wizard can come back to life, so I cannot give Mr. Franken a thousand galleons.  I was, however, able to come up with enough Muggle money to buy his new book.  I encourage you to do the same!	2003-11-29

Doesn't anybody really realize that political tracts (commentary in book form) are neither fair nor balanced...from EITHER SIDE!  The best way to conduct political research is by reading books about the same subject from varying angles and making an informed decision based upon the sum total of the facts.  So, for reviewers on here to fan the flames of conservatism or liberalism in response to this book is total lunacy.  FOX News really screwed this up for themselves.  Much like our (hehehehe) &quot;beloved&quot; president who thinks wearing an Army jacket and appearing in Baghdad for a surprise Thanksgiving dinner is going to score him election points NEXT YEAR, FOX tried to use this book as a piece of propaganda in favor of themselves and their news channel...and it has failed terribly.  Don't they realize that the American people love the media...and if you put something in their face...whether it be pro-cause or against, people are going to read it?  I am sure that Mr. Franken is loving all of the publicity given to him by FOX...even though he is the exact opposite of what they support.  <br />And...to the small little war between smutpusher and Mr. Harlow...might I add a couple cents.  First, it seems that Mr. Pusher has a problem with name calling.  Not once in Mr. Harlow's reviews/retort did he call Mr. Pusher a name.  Strange, Conservatives always accuse Liberals of name calling....but it sure seems that they are the ones doing the most of it.  Go figure.  *shrug*  Second, FOX News seem to be more &quot;dweebish&quot; than Mr. Harlow....seeing as how they are the ones feeding the popularity of this &quot;liberal&quot; tome.  Third, at least Mr. Franken probably isn't preoccupied with McCarthyism like Ms. Coulter.  That fact alone scares me.  I honestly tried to read her book, but I just couldn't get past 30 pages....the prose was so below my intelligence...I just got bored with it.  I don't think I would get that way with Mr. Franken.  And...I am not even going there with Mr. Hannity.<br />So, read all of these books with caution.  Make sure that you read across the political spectrum...and make decisions for yourselves!  Don't rely on these folks to feed you their political agendas!  Make them for yourselves!  And good luck to smutpusher and Mr. Harlow....may your review war end in peace.<br />PS....I am neither Republican or Democrat...give me Independent thinking any day!	2003-11-28

When the 'brouhaha' began with Fox Network upon it's release, it made me wonder what they were so worried about (truly, not just an 'infringement' on their slogan), and what they wanted to keep hidden?<br />From page one, I waas hooked. It is not a 'humorous' book, but more of an entertaining, and dare I say 'honest' book, educating the reader into what is really going on in the media world today. With a sense of humor (but not the &quot;Aren't I hilarious?&quot; wink dominant in comedian's books these days), and seriousness, Franken successfully enlightens the reader as to the stunts and structure the media is paralyzed by these days. He explains with deftness and clarity, what the mouthpieces are telling us - and what it all actually means; very helpful to those like myself who find them utterly boring yet boggling. He tears apart percentage charts, flowcharts, and various economic tables - for the benefit of showing the reader that much of what is being fed to us is bull. He does it all with earnest and sincerity.<br />Bravo! to Fox News; for giving Franken the kind of publicity money can't buy (and encouraging readers like myself to read the books we first dismissed). Encore! to Franken; let us hope this is not the last. Certainly, one of 2003's &quot;Best of Books&quot;.	2003-11-28

The chickenhawk chapter (about rightist draft dodgers) should be dropped from the paperback edition.   It detracts from an otherwise fine book.   It's a little overboard to maintain that Clinton:  (1) is a liberal.  Wrong, he's a centrist and not really a very good civil libertarian.  (2) Did more to fight terrorists than any other Pres.  He certainly did more than Bush 43.   Can't agree that B Goldberg is in the same category with Coulter, Hannity, Beck,  Limbaugh, O'Reilly.   He's a couple of cuts above that crew.

For his pomposity alone (never mind his behavior on C-SPAN), O'Reilly deserves every barb Franken tossed his way. The fact that Al despises Ann Coulter does nothing but endear him to me further. <br />Franken's fresh style, brutal honesty and whitty outlook on life make for a quick read that left me wanting more. Rush Limbaugh fans may not like it, but open-minded, free-thinking patriots who value honesty will relish this lampoon of the new century's UNfair and UNbalanced news media.<br />Mr. Franken, bring on the sequel !!!	2003-11-26

This book is most helpful for those who aren't certain, and for those who to arm themselves for the next round of armchair politics.  Much of this really comes down to whom you believe.  However, I did research some of Franken's facts, and found them to be accurate.  Some of them I already knew to be accurate.<br />The basic message I got out of this book is that we are being betrayed by our media and our government.  The media is not telling us the facts which we need to know.  It gives some politicians a free ride, while gleefully scewering others (for the record, Gore WAS involved with the creation of the internet).  For instance, why were there so many stories about Clinton being a draft dodger, but none about Bush, or many other conservative draft dodgers?  Why is it not reported that Bush deserted his National Guard unit for almost a year?<br />We are also being betrayed by Bush and his cronies.  First of all, Bush is NOT  conservative.  John McCain is a conservative, and a decent man.  You'll note that he has been fairly critical of some of Bush's legislation, calling his energy bill &quot;no lobbyist left behind.&quot;  No, Bush is not conservative, he's simply corrupt.  He's a spoiled rich kid who never had to do an honest days work, or truly earn anything, in his life, he has no understanding or sympathy for anybody born less fortunate than himself.  His agenda is simply to help other rich people like him.  He stole a $4.6 trillion surplus, and gave it to his rich family and friends.  Now he's borrowing many in our names in order to give it to his rich family and friends.<br />But back to the book.  Franken illustrates how Bush (and others) simply make entirely false claims, and never get called on it.  They state the majority of the tax cuts go to those at the bottem, but this is patently false; he states no child will be left behind, and then leaves millions behind; he states hewill protect our resources, then turns them over to industry to be raped; he claims the studies prove abstinence only education works best, but the opposite is true; he claimed Clinton gutted the military and two entire divisions were not ready for duty, a complete fabrication; yet who is calling him on this?  He has betrayed the ideals of any honest conservative, and is turning his party into a mockery of itself.  The republicans should be the ones to be truly enraged.<br />At times Franken descends into gratuitious, and superfluous attacks.  In general, his point had already been made, such as with &quot;Chickenhawk&quot;.  The fictional piece doesn't add much, it only insult, and wasn't that enertaining.  It's probably there to help sell books.<br />His mini-comic on &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot; was more insightful than most give it credit.  It asks the question &quot;what does orthodox Christianity have in common with supply side ecomonics?&quot;  How did this religion get so tied up with this economic theory.  It certainly isn't in the bible as far as I'm aware, and isn't much in keeping with the example set by Jesus.  If you want an example of a good, honest, and devout Christian politician, you should look to Jimmy Carter!<br />In short, this book is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand political discourse in this country.  It's funny, insightful, and loaded with facts.	2003-11-26

Do you ever wonder why anything the conservatives don't like they either try to SHUT UP or simply label it LIBERAL?  Conservatives believe that if you aren't toeing the party line you're a LIBERAL who should SHUT UP.  Well, there are a lot of people who I'm sure would agree with me that if it weren't for &quot;liberal-minded&quot; people who decided to SPEAK UP as opposed to SHUT UP we would still think the earth was flat, not to mention the center of the universe.  Galileo would be considered a liberal, not because he was right or wrong but because he wasn't toeing the status quo set forth by the conservatives of the time (i.e., the papacy).  So it is plain to me that all throughout history there have been both people speaking out with facts like Al Franken and those barking and biting, not because the facts are wrong, simply because they are too ignorant to respond to a intellectual challenge.  <br />This book was very informative as well as entertaining.  Franken is extremely gifted at conveying his points with subtle to not so subtle humor and solid facts.  If I had to use a mathematical metaphor to explain this book it would be: 2+2=4.  What the conservatives would like us to buy is that X+Y=4, with Y fixed at 2 and X can be any number that serves there purpose except 2.  This of course would render a unbalanced equation so perhaps, in reference to that limp lawsuit FOX attempted on &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;, FOX's new slogan should be &quot;Unfair and Unbalanced - Views of what the heck is going on in the country&quot;.  <br />If they use this, should I sue them?	2003-11-26

Al has great passion for what he's writing about and for a refreshing change, this author has the truth on his side.  <br />I've never called myself a liberal or a conservative as I prefer to develop my opinions issue by issue, but if anyone can turn me into a Liberal, it's Al Franken.  Franken makes several great points in the book but where the book really hits home is his work concerning President Bush.  Never before has a President gotten away with so many deceptions.  9/11 did two very powerful things...<br />1. World opinion turned more pro U.S. than at any other time in our history.  I received a couple emails a day talking about foreigners and their positive views of Americans.<br />2. Americans turned more pro government than at any time in our history.  The heat was taken off of Bush as Americans got behind him, hoping that he would go after the people behind the events of 9/11.<br />Instead of going after Bin Laden and his organization until we finished the job, Bush's personal agenda took over and we turned our military resources towards Iraq for no reason at all.( Oh I guess now the reason was that Saddam was a bad guy)  It wasn't to difficult to see that going after Iraq was wrong.  Basically we rewarded Bin Laden by taking out his biggest rival in the middle east.  In the process Bush flipflopped world opinion by thumbing his nose at our best international friends.  We should have known something was wrong when even Canada and Mexico wouldn't go along with us.  Now we're left with the most anti U.S. world opinion in our history.  180 degrees in the opposite direction.<br />Franken points out that Bush's policy towards anything is to put money in the pockets of his wealthy constituency.  From his ridiculous tax cuts for the rich, to his energy bill, to the non-bid contracts going to Halliburton in Iraq, to the the recent Medicare legislation that actually bans Medicare from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices, everything this administration does, it does for the extremely rich.  And it's taken Bush only 3 years to dwarf the enormous deficit that Reagan and his Father took 12 years to build, and Clinton 8 years to correct.<br />Al, you've opened my eyes.  We have to get this administration out of office.  Vote Democrat in 2004, no matter who the Democrat is.	2003-11-25

It is a lucid and often hilarious analysis of what passes for political discourse in the US today. Too many good chapters to name a favorite but \\"Loving America the Al franken Way\\" stands out because it focuses on the difference between how progressives and right wingers love their county. Brilliant stuff.<br />In the post 9-11 environment political dissent has been stifled by a poisonous patriotic fervor that threatens the health of American democracy. Franken highlights the inherent dangers by lampooning the demaguogery of the right wing nutjobs like Hannity, Coulter and \\"O'Lielley.\\" <br />Bush takes his licks later in the book and Franken puts his disastreous fiscal and foreign policies under his satirical microscope - the chapter with the tax lawyer and waitress particularly illustrating the shameful misrepresentation of his tax cuts to the working masses.<br />With humor, Mr. Franken has managed to expose the mendacity of the American right for all to see and it is not pretty.	2003-11-25

I tend to listen to a lot of talk radio though, I think Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are hilarious.  :)  But the key for me is not taking them so seriously, because at heart - they are entertainers.  They are trying to get listeners and ratings, that is their number one goal!  The same goes for people like Al Franken and his book.  While he may have some interesting points that I do agree with, his bottom line is making $$ on it.  Because of that, I think he tends to exaggerate things and say things that are way over the top - it's more interesting to read than the truth sometimes.  So with that, I will say this book was an interesting and fun read - and I do recommend it to conservatives and liberals alike!	2003-11-25

We were surprised he didn't come clean with his plan to trap O'Reilly at the book convention - wouldn't want to catch Franken in a lie would we?<br />Franken continues to claim that he is a friend of the Wellstone family. He is not and never was - he is trying to capitalize on the death of an articulate and accomplished Senator. The descendants of Paul Wellstone are embarrassed that an ugly, trite gossip would dare invoke their father's name in such a shameless and self-absorbed fashion. It is time for Wellstone's family to repudiate this repugnant, retarded chipmunk.<br />As with his book, Franken seems to laugh the hardest at his own jokes. He brays like a donkey at what he thinks his funny, while the crowd seemed to titter in embarrassment. We can't imagine a more pathetic liberal hero than this closet teen slurper.<br />By the way, Al Franken does not support the troops, even though he feels he has to reiterate in every public forum. He likes to play patriot, but we all know the truth. Who's the real liar?	2003-11-24

I know I couldn't live another day without knowing about this whopper of a lie.  Mr. Franken also points out that Dick Cheney stated that Arlington National Cemetery has rows and rows of crosses when actually it doesn't have crosses as tombstones.  Another whopper I couldn't live without knowing.  Mr. Franken points out shortcomings in people's memories and the exact circumstances that encompass trivial events.  If Mr. Franken is so \\"fair and balanced\\", I wonder why he didn't explore the statements of a former U.S. President who said, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lowinsky\\".

Take the last committer of this fraud, David Beall, who further contributes disrepute by claiming he's an expatriate living in the States for 15 years. What really aggravates one is the increasingly, self-righteously derisive number of positive reviewers who are regularly resorting to tarnishing those Americans that support Bush, or are Republican/Conservative, as being less sophisticated than their unwashed, inert, work-shirking, less productive and less affluent European counterparts.<br />David Beall's review does this nicely, as he attempts to cite-get this-for the \\"first time\\" ever in all the reviews, \\"real\\" reasons to support Franken's gibberish and \\"debunk\\" the one-star reviews. Obviously, his comments are exclusively either so discriminatingly suffocating, so to be unstable and extremist in nature, superficially profiling based on general stereotypes of conservatives, ridiculously immaterial \\"points\\" that are harshly secondary to the topic, or DOWNRIGHT, utterly imperfect, unmasking its nature in an unqualified background.<br />Beall spews that the mean Frenchman bests his American counterpart. Beall cites false proofs like Frenchmen \\"having 4-6 weeks vacation a year, enjoy long lunches with excellent wine, can wander through streets with beautiful architecture, have affordable health care, job security and very little poverty\\". To anyone NOT programmed with anti-American propaganda from radical sites like Tom Payne, this is offensively outraging. Here's the amending correction to that reviewer's increasingly moronic and classless tripe.<br />France is currently in RECESSION, has DOUBLE-DIGIT unemployment, its government must now stoop to helped employment and its workers aren't nearly as productive as Americans. These are cold FACTS. Do these actual statistics really correspond to David Beall's agenda of smearing Americans as inferiors, where he claims that the French have \\"job security\\" and \\"very little poverty\\"?? Does anyone really think that having 6 weeks vacation in their incrementally worker protected land is not to blame for their comparably lesser wealth??? Further, since Beall is so loathsomely undereducated about economies, that elusive \\"French job security\\" is EXACTLY why they're recession prone-because laws force businesses in Europe to pay lazy bums even when they're not working and it's much more expensive for European firms to cut workers in recessionary times, all further contributing to a feeble economy with lower living standards!<br />Next, Beall loses control in another prejudicial attack, this time on the American worker. He writes, \\"His American counterpart is lucky to get 2 weeks vacation, works like a dog, eats processed meat from factory farms without proper hygiene and worker safety/benefits, and were there a good chance he lives below the poverty level having had a comparatively poor education, and his future probably means he will lose his manufacturing job in exchange for a job at K-Mart.\\"<br />It's really an outrage for ragingly glaring, closet liberals to try to pull this scheme off. A Frenchman's American counterpart is under no pressure to get only 2 weeks vacation; he does this because of his superior work ethic, wherein America's mentality is more along the lines of working hard to achieve what one wants to attain, instead of the panhandling mentality of France, where that stigma has certainly materialized in LESS jobs and LOWER economic growth. Because of a Frenchman's American counterpart's humbly small vacation time, his American counterpart also enjoys higher living standards in terms of personal wealth, higher pay, stronger spending power, and ultimately contributes to the States' enviably, significantly higher GDP output-both in spending and production, which is the logical side effect of also having much higher production than ol' Europe. All of these factors blatantly improve comforts for people, hence their quality of life.<br />David Beall's jeers at the American worker supposedly living \\"below the poverty level\\" is more confirmation of a closet liberal, owing to how insanely biased that is, and how unschooled that statement is. If the American worker's wealth is directly proportional to his output (Americans are number one), it's discreditable for that failure to even write that. Next, stats say that the States boasts the best graduate school program the world over, so, again, it's blasphemy for someone to curse that an American has \\"comparatively poor education\\". Anyone still not convinced that Beall is the guiltiest closest liberal prowling these messages??<br />The last straw is when this closet liberal assaults a job at K-Mart, obviously in his scornfully elitist mind, equating jobs in the retail sector with being demeaning. A fictional employee at K-Mart, much like Wal-Mart (world's biggest employer of workers, btw), would garner advantageous benefits and probably stock options also. Not like in unhygienic France, and miserably most of Europe, where companies are REQUIRED by European's misguided ignorance to \\"look out for everyone equally\\", where they waste the comparable 21 billion that the American worker is putting back into his economy, with the infamous French welfare-system/garbage of unnaturally LONG unemployment benefits and punishing penalties for companies that need to downscale by firing employees, by intensifying the money employers HAVE to pay to reduce workforce.<br />Conclusion: If this David Beall, closet liberal, is the best example of the liberals here, who so high-handedly and hypocritically challenge the right to \\"provide facts\\", citing \\"facts\\" to \\"back up\\" their \\"points\\", then liberal reasoning is cancerously impaired. Liberals here, and David Beall, need to get an education, a clue, AND a life. Scariest of all, NOT necessarily in that order.	2003-11-21

The \\"reviewer from Connecticut's comments (code for unilateral libel against Bush) incurred righteous anger in my practical-minded soul. In it, he masks his closet-liberal tendencies, by shamelessly posing as a \\"conservative\\". Yet all his views precisely succumb to the evil scourge that liberalism is, more so than if he was its poster-boy. He derides Bush as \\"having hijacked the Republican Party, with his \\"necon buddies\\", and used it to pursue a completely vicious and destructive extremist agenda, having subverted true conservative principles of protecting civil liberties and practicing fiscal discipline.\\"<br />In light of this uncontrollable extremism on HIS part, WILLFULLY devoid of ANY logical reasoning attributes, I'm now forced to educate him, so to curb the extremism that is all his own, in the way he leaps to conclusion.<br />First of all, neoconservatism isn't a dirty, four-letter word. It seeks to spread American influence the world over, especially on the most barbaric places of the world (the ones the liberals rave over), and is diligent when it comes to putting words into action, by pursuing military actions against countries that won't comply with international mandates, and/or harbor terrorism. Segueing into the Iraq situation, most of the country's peaceful and stable, with the only resistance coming out of the moderately small Sunni Triangle, which is OF COURSE all that one gets force fed, through the liberal media that desperately wants American failure in Iraq, so they can continue to attack Bush for everything short of how the weather's doing. Further, the war was/is OBVIOUSLY legal, do to resolution 1441, years of UN violations on Hussein's part, and the UN's own mandate allowing for preemptive self-defense! <br />Bush's foreign policy is neither vicious OR extremist, seeing as how rationale abides by the fact that action where the terrorists are avoids hundreds of 9/11's, tenfold! Since Syria, Iran and countless other Arab countries are sendingtheir \\"freedom fighters\\" to \\"liberate\\" Iraq from the \\"Great Satan\\", that alone establishes terrorism ties to Iraq. Before any dummy lib resorts to attacking me, I'm not making a connection between Hussein and 9/11, only terminally braindead libs believe that Bush has ever made that connection. <br />Further, \\"Connecticut reviewer\\"'s also slanderous relating to civil liberties. If not for the Patriot Act, 9/11's would be achievable at the will of terrorists-but....I guess that he'd rather like the government NOT to invade his privacy A LITTLE, if that means he can continue to send e-mails to other workers defaming his boss while on the job!!!!!!! Again, the war on terrorism FORCES rulebreaking when it comes to fiscal discipline; as 9/11, corporate scandal, fake jobs in internet companies, recession AND the stock market BUBBLE bursting all contributed to the current debt, which all happened under Clinton's stewardship.<br />BTW, I AM A LIBERAL, and sick AND tired of my party's idiocies!!!!!	2003-11-21

After reading the Take off Your Blinders review by a conservative, I feel even better about Al Franken's amazing book. No only is it extremely well researched (down to transcripts of television broadcasts), but the points he makes are unavoidable. Before W. were living in peacetime, there was an anti-terrorism plan in place, civil liberties weren't at risk, and we had a surplus. And now, our young people are coming home in caskets, we are stuck in a mess in Iraq, the world hates us, and we're supposed to pay $87 billion to get out of it.<br />My dad, a lifelong Republican, said &quot;we've got to get this guy out of there,&quot; referring to Bush. To him (and to the Blinders reviewer), conservatism has nothing at all to do with running up huge deficits and wanton spending (such as $8,000 for Ashcroft's curtain). He also points out that we won in Kosovo without losing one American life.<br />Franken is right on all counts, but he makes you laugh while you are pounding the armrest in anger. If he's done anything good this year, Franken has motivated a lot of people to get out and do something about this disaster we are in now.<br />Fantastic work.

Ok well I don't know about that last part. But this is a good book. Mr. Franken exposes a large amount of lies that conservatives in the media and White House spit out. He also exposes the myth that the media has a liberal bias. The conservatives have no limits or morals when it comes to lying. They will twist what you say to make it work in their favor. But you have to read the book to fully understand what I mean. <BR>Before I summarize more deeply into this review, let me explain my political beliefs: I am against gun control. I think it is our Constitutional right to own a gun(granted of course we have no record of crime or psychosis). I have doubts about the death penalty system but I support it for now. I think abortion is not a real issue. Its an issue but its not really a worldwide problem, but I'll save that subject for another review. I believe working men and women are more important to America than businessmen. Working men are the ones who built this country with their bare hands. I am also in favor of any organizations who improve the quality of life to working class men and women. I consider myself liberal but not too liberal. <BR>OK now back to the review. Al Franken explains with examples and proof just how brutal the conservatives' lies can be. In the middle of the book Al shows us how the conservatives took advantage of a memorial service to Wellstone and turned it into propaganda for the news. My favorite part was the chapter called &quot;The Gospel of Supply-Side Jesus&quot;. This was a satirical look about how Jesus felt about rich and poor people. Its a cartoon, and on one of the panels is a quote from Jesus saying &quot;It is easier for a rich man to enter heaven seated comfortably on the back of a camel, than it is for a poor man to pass through the eye of a needle.&quot; Of course the real quote from Jesus was &quot;It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.&quot; as itsays in Matthew 19:24. This is what confuses me about conservatives. They claim to love God so much yet they have policies that benefit the rich man at the expense of the middle man, they promote capitol punishment, which Jesus was a victim of, and they love the fetus but cut the budget for it when it is born, as they are doing with No Child Left Behind (which public schools all hate).<BR>You will without a doubt enjoy this book.	2003-11-19

It scares me that people with so much power are capable of telling such egregious lies and some even lie about telling lies.  What's up with that?  The book is not hateful as the title would suggest.  It is intelligently written and, from what I gathered by reading all the footnotes, painstakingly factual.  My one disappointment is that Al didn't autograph it to me personally.  It's a generic signature either by Al or someone who writes like him. I still want to have Al Franken's love child.  I'm kidding---on the square.	2003-11-19

I think that Franken owes a debt to Bill O'Reilly and the Fox Network for providing him with all that free publicity, and Franken has admitted this. Since I live in Canada most of the people who Franken dismantles aren't that familiar to me. Where I live, I don't get Ann Coulter's program or Bill O'Reilly so the only time that I've seen them is when they are guests on other networks. As far as I can tell however, Franken's book amounts to no more than the old saying:&quot;turnabout is fair play&quot;. If you're going to trash talk someone you shouldn't be surprised if they trash talk you in return. Unfortunately, for the people that Al Franken targets, he is much funnier and better at it than they are. No wonder that O'Reilly and Fox News wanted to sic the lawyers on him.	2003-11-18

Even though I vote democrat, I found myself trying to pick apart his arguments and data sources.  Most of the time his logic was decent, not bulletproof, but OK.  It did an adequately convincing job of call the quality of our president and his administration into question.  Most of his research was OK, not great, but OK.  Maybe another 3 months of reseach would have made this book truely compelling.<br />When Franken goes in-depth (e.g. the Clinton plan to fight terrorism...which was stalled by the Bush White House from early 2001 through the events of Septermber 11th, or the myth of the liberal media, etc.) citing memos, non-partisan sources, newspaper stories and the like, he's at his best.  Other times, I felt that he needed a few more sources to be truely convincing.  Also, sometimes the profanity distracted me from what he was talking about.  <br />The take home message from this book is not to make Al Franken your personal savior, but to open your mind to things that go unreported in the news, and some of the suspicious things behind our leaders.  Regardless if you believe everything he says or not, he is making an attempt to get at the truth behind the motivations of the Bush administration.  What he found is throught-provoking.<br />Even so, Al's a satirist, just like Rush Limbaugh, Michael Moore, Sean Hannity, etc.  We should take everything satirist's say with a grain of salt.  Rush Limbaugh's drug problem and qualifications call his credibility into question.  Moore's movies and books are funny and illuminating, but his assertions can be wild and misleading too.  Franken and Hannity are, or have been, comedians - rather than trained experts on political policy and legalese.  Since all of them are satirists, we can enjoy what they say, but we should be careful to find out for ourselves if what they say is completely true.  If you think of this book as Al talking about his experiences and perspective, it's actually pretty good.<br />Whereas Rush, Sean, and Michael Moore try to tell you how to think and behave in their books and radio programs, Al lets you decide for yourself - which is refreshing.<br />(For the record, I voted Democratic in the last 3 elections, and view myself as personally conservative but socially liberal.)	2003-11-17

I like to think I've learned a little analytical skill in my 50 years.

An outsider looking in would have to come to the conclusion that both liberal and conservative opinions are right and wrong to the same degree. There is lying and arrogance from both fronts. Everything is just a matter of perspective isn't it? I don't like Franken because he has no manners. Michael Moore holds all you book-buyers in absolute contempt because he knows he is smarter than you (conned you into buying his book, didn't he?). Everything either of these gentlemen have to say can be countered in kind from the opposite perspective. So don't any of you think 'your side' is all that; just stop and think for yourselves. . .and be suspicious of them all.

If more people were like Franken and pointed out when pundits lied maybe they wouldn't do it so often.  The reviewer who wrote that the chapter on Bill O'Reilly is just a rant on the Peabody is mistaken. He covers other lies by O'Reilly as well. The point Franken was making is that O'Reilly refuses to retract his statements when he is wrong. He is the opposite of humble. There is another very good example of this in the book of an arguement Franken had with O'Reilly years ago when Franken appeared on O'Reilly's show as a guest.	2003-11-16

The most ridiculous example of this is when Franken seriously tries to make a case that the media was biased in favor of Bush leading up to the 2000 elections.  His primary piece of evidence?  That a group of Columbia professors said so.<br />It's in absurd sections like these that Franken is guilty of everything he accuses his enemies of, such as selective use of statistics, distorted anecdotal evidence, and outright lies.  Too bad he couldn't stop himself from going down that path, as it greatly weakens the funnier parts of the book.<br />Finally, I can't fail to mention Mr. Franken's inclusion near the end of the book of a one-act play he wrote about a waitress and a tax attorney.  This section takes the cake for some of the clunkiest writing I have ever read.  It's the polemical Plan 9 From Outer Space, to be savored for its hysterical ineptitude.  Even Bill O'Reilly's awful suspense novel has literary merit when compared with this gem.  Who knew that Franken, normally such a savvy wit, could write such a clunker and honestly think it worthy of publication?<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, who, like me, derives a guilty pleasure from reading these angry political screeds.  I read this book shortly after finishing Treason by Ann Coulter.

If you bought this expecting to learn something substantive about politics and political philosophy, you'll be even more disappointed.  While this book might climb the charts, and be a favorite among the hard-core left, it really falls flat as an exposition of the Right.  Al Franken's hatred for the Right comes through almost on every page, but his criticism tends to vary between the pedantic and the petty.  Take his charges against Mr Bill O'Reilly for example.<br />According to Mr Franken O'Reilly once claimed that Inside Edition won two Peabody Awards, but when Franken does a little detective work he learns that Inside Edition never won a Peabody, but a Polk back in 1995, after O'Reilly had moved on to greener pastures.  Now is this a lie?  Did O'Reilly deliberately make this up hoping someone wouldn't catch him?  Or did he just remember Inside Edition winning an award and thought it was Peabody?  <br />Regardless of where you come down the question, it is obvious that this &quot;lie&quot; has nothing to do with politics, the Right in America, or anything else.  At most it would prove that O'Reilly -- unlike all other Americans -- likes to embellish his resume a little.  But Franken's agenda is really more subtle and insidious -- he ties O'Reilly to the Right, calls attention to the fact that O'Reilly falsely claimed to win a Peabody, and uses the incident as a template to discolor the entire right-wing in America.  His implication is that the Right is fundamentally dishonest, unscrupulous, and its agenda only can survive by emiting lie after lie to cover its true character from the American people.  <br />We should remember that O'Reilly's political hero is Bobby Kennedy, that he regards Franklin Roosevelt as the greatest President of the 20th century, and was one of the biggest supporters of Clinton's war against Serbia.  <br />Franken makes much ado over Hannity'ssloppy arithmetic in claiming the Middle Class benefits the most from Bush's tax cut.  Of course this is more of a semantic debate rather than a real one.  In absolute dollars more money will flow to the rich, but the Middle Class will receive a greater percentage return from the tax cut.  Why then is it wrong to suggest that Middle Class are the ones to benefit the most from the tax cut?  For instance, if someone says China is the fastest growing economy, measuring in at 10% annual growth, would that be inaccurate?  After all, if the United States' economy grows at 4% annually, it actually grew much more -- in absolute terms -- than China's economy did.  But we measure growth in percentages, not absolute dollars.  That is why it is fair to say that the Middle Class are the primary beneficiaries of Bush's tax cuts -- Franken's analysis notwithstanding.  <br />We live in age of pop journalism, pop science, and pop culture.  Al Franken's books, like Michael Moore's, will get an instant popular reception on the charts but will soon be forgotten and will not be remembered for adding a single bit of wisdom to political discussion.  <br />Remember, if your time is valuable, then this book isn't.	2003-11-15

He kids about things but he means what he says.  AF points out many things in the media that might otherwise go unnoticed.  I came to this book thinking it would be a hatchet job on the right by confirmed lefty.  If you read this for the humor alone you'll be fine.  This is one of the few books to make me laugh out loud while reading.  The funniest thing was AF's proposed commercial of Presidential candidate John Kerry running a commercial dressed up as a pirate and poking fun at W for dressing up as a fighter pilot for his photo op.<br />I like Bush and I like the right, but AF managed to score some points on Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and Bill O'Reilly in an amusing way and using unbelievable quotes from their own books.  Though AF accuses the right of blaming Clinton for everything, AF doesn't bother to lay anything at Clinton's doorstep.  It is because of that, that LIES lacks some credibility.  If AF had pointed his sharp tongue at Gore and Clinton as often as he did at W, Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, etc., this book would have bordered on &quot;Fair and Balanced.&quot;<br />AF says Gore should have won the presidency.  Fine.  If Gore's so great and came so close to being president, why isn't he running for the 2004 bid?  How come he couldn't win in his own state of Tennessee and make the vote in Florida moot?

Boo hoo!\\" he seems to be saying, \\"It's not FAIR that Bush is in the White House! How DARE people like Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter be so successful?!?\\" Speaking of the latter, he seems to be especially resentful of her success, which is ironic inasmuch as she does basically the same thing he does, namely, mix political commentary with humor and venom. Perhaps he's jealous and senses that she's actually better at it? Who knows, and ultimately, who cares? Like Coulter, Franken is basically preaching to the choir, hence neither really makes any effort to be either fair-minded or intellectually honest. The end result is that these \\"Attack\\" books serve mainly to whip up a froth of indignation and anger in their readers and thus contribute, not enlightenment but further polarization.<br />So the question is, does the continuing popularity of the attack books mean that Americans really are at each others' throats politically? Or does it mean that Americans don't really take this stuff very seriously, and view it primarily as entertainment? Personally, I'm hoping it's the latter. The problem with this book, however, is that it's hard to tell where the \\"serious\\" content ends and the funny stuff begins. In the intro, for example, he claims that his \\"Facts\\" (assembled by the modestly named \\"Team Franken\\") are all true, and that anything that isn't is obviously intended as satire. Problem is, it ain't so obvious. At one point Franken allegedly challenges a conservative magazine editor to a fistfight. Now, for Franken's sake, I'm HOPING that's satire, since the notion of a grown man in his early 50's with a wife and kids actually picking a fight with someone over a mere political dispute strikes me as downright bizarre. There's another scene where he supposedly met Barbara Bush on a plane, then got her mad at him by making fun ofGeorge W's looks and mannerisms. This, he opines, is \\"proof\\" that the former First Lady is the Queen of Mean. Well, putting aside the question of \\"Was it real, or was it Memorex?\\", what was he expecting? I'm sure Queen Elizabeth would have responded in exactly the same way had some obnoxious twit dared to make Dumbo ear gestures when discussing Prince Charles in her presence. If the Barbara Bush encounter on the plane really happened and isn't just another of Franken's jokes, then all I can say is \\"Bravo!\\" to Mrs. Bush for not suffering fools gladly. Rather than whine about her dismissive treatment, he should realize he was just given a free lesson in manners and in comporting oneself with class and dignity. We should all have parents who display that level of loyalty and family unity.<br />As for the rest of the book, well, if you're a liberal, you'll at least get a few laughs. And that's about it. If you think this book in any way actually contributes to serious discourse, then you've spent much too long with your head up your posterior. However, unlike the plethora of fools who've been peppering their opponents' books with cheap one star ratings in a hope to, I suppose, dampen sales, I'll at least give Franken his due. He's a good entertainer, and that's exactly what books like this are for, no more, no less.	2003-11-15

However, several problems with this book prevent it from being considered a serious piece of quality work.  <br />1) Frankens injected humor:  i.e. O'reilly's next book &quot;How to Deal with Syphillis&quot;  (i can't remember if this &quot;joke&quot; is actually in the book, but he did use it on The View in November).....there are tons of references like these that just aren't funny and cause me to view the book as worse than it probably is <br />2) Franken goes on about Coulter and how she refers to her &quot;endnotes&quot; as &quot;footnotes&quot;.  Well you know what Al, her &quot;footnotes&quot; are a lot easier to ride and find sources than yours.  Franken has occasional footnotes but the majority of his endnotes are not cited (whereas Coulters are).  This really lays at the credibility of the book (at least to me) because when you are writing a book trying to prove something someone said is false or not correct you need specific examples, evidence or statistics and you need to cite them. When he says &quot;O'reilly said 57% of black mothers are unwed...But he's wrong, its really only 14%&quot;  without any mention to any study, newspaper article or anything.  Maybe this slows the book down, but if you're to believe his claim then you need some kind of truthful evidence.  This is really what causes me to view the book at 2 stars instead of 3 or 4.  <br />3) I don't know why Franken puts O'reilly on the cover because of the 3 or 4 &quot;lies&quot; he claims to have on O'reilly only 1 of them holds any water.  The whole Levittown meager beginnings thing...O'reily says he grew up in the Westbury section of Levittown.  Westbury was the town and Levittown the area (such as I might say that I am from Philadelphia even though I live in Manayunk, Villanova, Haverford, or Merion.  The whole Polk/Peabody thing:  I don't think there has ever been a point where O'reilly said &quot;I won a Peabody award&quot; , He has said Inside Edition won peabody awards or &quot;We won peabody awards (which is technically inaccurate because he was not on the show when it won the award) but this &quot;lie&quot; that Franken claims just doesn't hold up, especially since O'reilly twice corrected his earlier &quot;wrong&quot; statement.  The only claim that Franken makes which is a substantial one is the Republican voter registration card.  <br />Overall, if Franken (to borrow an O'reilly word), cut out the pith sprinkled it with occasional light humor, got rid of all the swears and cited all of his statistics or articles with footnotes or endnotes (which ever he prefers since he seems to want to be completely clear on them), he would have a pretty good book.	2003-11-15

I happen to agree with everything Franken has to say, but at the same time I found this book somewhat repetative and boring. He states more and more lies by the right, which are interesting at first, but get tiresome after about half the book. If you are very liberal(like myself) you will often be frustrated by the facts presented in this book and I think I would rather read and Ann Coulter book and think about how crazy she is, then hear propoganda from my own side.	2003-11-14

Mr Franken is SO upset that American voters have given the GOP the majority in both Houses of Congress, the nations' Governors mansions AND  the White House that his angry liberal rhetoric is at an all time screeching high.

This review is aimed at certain other reviewers, who are claiming that Franken lied in his book.  These people are GRASPING AT STRAWS PEOPLE!!  In the chapter Abstinence Heroes, Franken displays a letter he sent to different abstinence education advocates, in which he says that he is writing a book called Savin' it and wanted each person to write back and give a story in which they were tempted to have sex but because of their beliefs said no.  Bare in mind that he sent this letter to people such as Newt Gingrich, and Pat Robertson, and then signed the letter with HIS OWN NAME (showing that he wasn't hiding anything). <BR> Anyone who read this letter would have seen it for what it was:  A JOKE.  OF course, being Franken, it also had some merit.  For all the people who stand so strongly against sexual education in school, not one of the 27 people he sent the letter to had an experience where they turned down the opportunity of sex because of their morals (at least not one they shared).  <BR>  What irritates me is that certain conservative reviewers are bitter about Franken's success, his book, and the lies he exposes within it.  Therefore, these individuals take something like this letter, which is obviously a farce (a very funny one at that) and tries to say that Franken was lieing.  Seriously, he said he had a chapter within the book called \\"Role Modelin it.\\"  That's hillarious!!!  And no one can say that when Ashcroft and Lott and every other person who received the letter looked down and saw it was signed by Al Franken that they didn't get the joke.  Even if they missed every other obvious clue and jest then in the end when they saw it signed by Franken they would KNOW!!!!<br />Finally, I'd like to end with a quote by our lovable genuis.  \\"If you think you've found something that rings untrue, you've probably just missed a hilarious joke, and should blame yourself rather than me or Teamfranken.\\"   (XIV) <br />GET IT NOW?	2003-11-14

This books is sensible, amazingly fair and the satirical humor makes it fun at the same time.  When it comes out in paperback, I'd like to buy a case to give out to family, friends and others who tell me I'm &quot;unpatriotic&quot; when I don't simply accept &amp; believe everything I hear from the media or my government.

I figured, \\"republicans can't really be this bad.\\"  But I could not find one single arguement that wasn't really true.  Every one of those arguments he makes cannot easily be disputed.  I recommend this book to anyone for any reason, especially for political reading, or entertainment value.<br />I would also like to rebuff an argument made by an earlier review: <br />\\"For instance, he [Franken] says that O'Reilly compared the Koran to Mein Kampf when really, he compared making Americans read the Kuran to the hypothetical situation of making Americans reading Mein Kampf during World War II. There is a difference.\\"<br />No there isn't.  Mein Kampf was written by Hitler, it is safe to say that nearly every American hated Hitler, he was a bad person.  The Koran is a religious document, that an entire religion is meant to follow.  Even by this guy's explanation, O'Reilly was saying that in a time like this, reading the Koran would be reading the evil literature of the enemy. PLEASE TELL ME YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THIS!!  I believe terrorists are the enemy, not the Islamic religion.<br />Anyway, once again, great book and a great view into the poitical world through the eyes of a logical, stratight-forward democrat (though I have to say, not necessarily all are.)	2003-11-13

Why? you ask.  Its because hes another comedian like Michael Moore who can not come up with valid real world solutions, instead they spin facts and phrases and poke fun at them, and LIBERALS EAT IT UP! its what they love to hear.  <br />Maybe if I went to one of the those clown colleges like Berkley I too would enjoy this book.  <br />But I give it 3 stars for the toliet paper aspect.	2003-11-12

I know that partisanship is here to stay, and that you shouldn't believe everything you hear or read, but he backs up every allegation with proof.  <br />It's an easy read.

This book proves to be a refreshing voice in the sea of dumbed down conglomerate media. I appreciate the fact that &quot;Team Franken&quot; breaks down so much of what is happening in modern politics for those of us who have little access and limited time to debunk most of what the media feeds us.<br />Parts of the book seemed unnecessary, like the cartoons and the fictional story involving Vietnam, but all in all, the facts are there in black and white and those are what matter most.  Sure Franken can be abrasive, but that's what kept me reading.  I only wish he would have used more of his signature sarcastic humor and fewer gimmicks.  All in all, this is a great read for anyone truly wanting the FACTS about the current state of affairs in this country.	2003-11-12

Let me just start out by saying that I am a liberal and am offended by this garbadge and by being affiliated with the author. Since when did dumb over the hill commedians become sources for political information and representatives of liberals? I agree with a lot of the information but the format is just nausiating. For example, I read &quot;Treason&quot; by Ann Coulter and was ready to throw up. I disagree with just about everything she says. But I would never stoop to that level of name calling and smearing. The best way is to not dignify it with response. I know Ann Coulter is wrong but there is no need to be as bad as she is. Stick with the more open minded Alan Colmes' book &quot;Red White and Liberal.&quot; His book pushes the &quot;liberal agenda&quot; with out the smearing. I urge EVERYONE(both conservatives and liberals) DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!	2003-11-12

Franken's wonderful sense of humor comes through on every well-researched page.  He takes fairly complicated issues (i.e. the estate tax) and not only makes them easy to understand, but has you cracking up as you read about them.  The book exposes lie after lie made by the Bush Administration, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, the Fox News Network and others.  In many instances, the lies exposed are truly frightening.  Franken's chapter on September 11 is a must read for all Americans.  Whether you are a Democrat, a Republican or somewhere in between, you will benefit from reading this book.	2003-11-12

First things first... if you are a conservative person, this book will send you into paroxysms of rage. Alternately, if you are a liberal person, this book will have you bruising your chin from nodding so often. Like it or not, we're living in the midst of a culture war, and the words of the enemy will always appear hysterical and false. And that's okay. If you don't like books by liberals, don't read them. Much as it pains me, I promise not to read books by Bill O'Reilly if the favor is returned. <br />That said, this is one funny and pertinent book. Triumphantly returning from a spate of so-so offerings after the wild success of &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot; Al Franken has put together a gotta-get-the-hardcover read. Sure, some chapters work better than others (the &quot;story&quot; toward the end is skip-worthy), but overall Franken and his crack team of researchers unleash a tidal wave of (measured) liberal rage. Franken hits all of the marks: Coulter, O'Reilly, Fox in general, and Bush. Franken is an emotional triple-threat: he is equally at ease unleashing his poisonous wit and political savvy as he is recounting somber moments of human tragedy. One gets the feeling that Franken really cares about this stuff, and it shows. <br />I did not give this book 5/5 stars because of the lengthy fictionalized chapter toward the end... but it can be skipped easily enough. So buy the book, skip that chapter, and laugh out loud while Franken unfurls his own irreverent brand of American liberal humor.	2003-11-11

There is a difference. <br /> <br />He also writes that O'Reilly is talented. I saw him a few nights ago on Conan O'Brien where he said that the reason O'Reilly doesn't do USO tours is because O'Reilly has no talent. I imagine Franken would say this is just an example of his satirical style but it appears that he is disingenuous in his attempts to not be as politically simple as he accuses his targets of being. <br /> <br />I wonder what Franken actually covers in his USO tours. I find it hard to believe that the commentary in this book would be very well recieved by US troops. And if the material he chooses for these tours is different, isn't that a kind of lie as well? And, in that case, what is his motivation to do the tours at all?	2003-11-11

The media is controlled by a band of mega-wealthy, immature, impudent right-wingers who have destroyed our American notion of free press and the free and fair exchange of ideas. Conveniently, they use their media to defame everyone who stands in the way of their agenda, to promote war and destruction, to hide environmental disasters, and to destroy political gain by opposing parties. Except for projectcensored.org, journalism in America is dead and has been supplanted by corporate propaganda which serves only the network owners who support right wing fanaticists rather than the audiences they pretend to care about. Franken does a fine job of calling them on the carpet, showing how news is invented to sabotage people, and how, although he has lost weight due to his medications, Rush Limbaugh is still a big (if no longer fat) idiot. The American people deserve better than the media and politics to which they are being subjected, and Franken won't let the abusive power-brokers get off the hook so easily. The lies and venom of Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Coulter, Gingritch and their ilk serve nobody but themselves. Hiding behind our American Flag, they are bullies in the greatest sense, interested in their own ratings and financial gains while deceiving their listeners into thinking they are intelligent, independent Americans. Give Franken the Nobel Prize and his own network because the majority of us Americans are sick of hearing only one-sided &quot;news&quot; and commentary.	2003-11-11

Or most of it.<br />This book uncovers a lot of dirty, downright corrupt activity on the right side of America's political spectrum.  If you're not quite sure who to believe, this would be *one* book worth reading, though not the only one.  The reason I took a star away from &quot;Lies&quot; is that it's only accurate concerning conservatives; Franken is very &quot;rah rah!&quot;  for the Democrats, neatly avoiding certain &quot;touchy&quot; points.<br />Franken's wit makes his words almost seem to grin, like those photographs you see of him on TV and in magazines.  Sometimes the jokes are a little weak, imho, but even then the actual argument is happily on target.  And he doesn't utterly desensitize or insult the reader's intelligence by resorting outrageous attacks; you won't find him seriously calling Ann Coulter a &quot;traitor&quot; anywhere in here.<br />Still, it's incredibly refreshing to see someone shoot down hateful conservatives, who are looking for an enemy/purpose to replace Communist Russia.  &quot;Lies&quot; is worth your money several times over.	2003-11-11

Like others who have reviewed it, my interest came about almost soley because of Fox News' efforts to squelch Franken.  Make no mistake, this book probably won't change the mind of a single person who believes what the apologists for the Bush administration spew on these programs, but it is an amazingly fact-filled and hilarious indictment of them for anyone willing to consider that, just maybe, this administration and it's cronies aren't all that honest.<br />The book does stumble occasionally, like the rather vitrioloic, and in my opinion overdone, fictional story of many of Franken's political and media foes having to go to Viet Nam in a single, horribly dysfunctional and self-serving unit, but redeems itself in the scathing short chapter in the form of a stage play about a tax attorney and a waitress going through the Bush Tax Cut.  The chapter on geysers of pig feces is simultaneously howlingly funny, in the manner of a David Sedaris verbal riff, and at the same time, pointedly indicative of the Bush administration's sorry record on the environment.<br />The bottom line is that it would take an eternity for an individual reader to research and verify all the information Al Franken has packaged in such an entertaining manner.  I'd have to guess that if it weren't all so spot on, Fox probably would have been successful in its litigation.  I will be sending copies of this book as gifts.	2003-11-10

While it is perhaps a little uneven in its hilarity, the funny parts are very funny and he is consistently merciless in his flogging of &quot;Right-wing&quot; liars. (He uses the term &quot;Left-wing&quot; maybe once and instead prefers &quot;liberal&quot;. I'm just trying to be fair and balanced.)<br />Kudos to Franken for catching people like Bill O'Reilly and Anne Coulter in deceitful lies. I'm talking big, huge whoppers meant to mislead. And it's hilarious when he does. These people are shameless liars and its fun to laugh at them. My one critique is that he goes after easy targets like O'Reilly, Coulter, Sean Hannity and George W. Bush who are all intellectually bankrupt miscreants. I don't blame Franken for doing so, that's where the big laughs (and the big lies) are. But the implication is that all conservatives are all like them--stupid, evil, and deceitful--and that's not fair.<br />Like in his other book, &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations&quot;, Franken complains about ad hominem attacks from the Right. Here he also points out how hypocritical Bush's pledge to &quot;change the tone in Washington&quot; was. But Franken proceeds to paint all conservatives and Republicans with the same broad brush, often acerbically.<br />I know. It's satire. I get it and it's funny, but I'm just pointing out what his target &quot;Left-wing&quot; audience will probably take for granted. He also does things like infiltrate Bob Jones University, or confront Barbara Bush, that could fairly be characterized as mean-spirited. But of course in this context he can say to anyone who grumbles, &quot;Oh lighten up! Don't you have a sense of humor?&quot;<br />And the thing is I do. If you know me, you know I'm no liberal.

To cite an example, a 1-star reviewer writes on Nov. 8, 2003:<BR>&quot;and Ann Coulter naming a list of ugly Democratic women. Didn't happen. Coulter recalls that left-wingers, while recoiling in horror from the idea of calling a woman ugly, had no trouble suggesting that &quot;the ugliest women ever to darken the planet are Paula Jones, Linda Tripp and [Florida Secretary of State] Katherine Harris.&quot; &quot;<br />Ann Coulter *does indirectly* label certain democratic women ugly. Here's Franken's excellent observation (footnote on page 85):<BR>&quot;Coulter, in her own deeply perverse idiom, weighs in on the issue of insulting women for their appearance. &quot;There is nothing so irredeemably cruel as an attack on a woman for her looks. Attacking a female for being ugly is a hideous thing, always inherently vicious...so which women are constantly being called ugly? Is it Maxine Waters, Chelsea Clinton, Janet Reno, or Madeline Albright? No, none of these. Only conservative women would have their looks held up to ridicule because only liberals could be so malevolent. A blind man in America would think the ugliest women ever to darken the planet are Paula Jones, Linda Tripp, and Katherine Harris. This from the party of Bella Abzug.&quot; Nicely done, Ann! Triple bank shot. Attacking Democrats for being irredeemably cruel while pointing to five, count 'em five, suppossedly unattractive Democratic women.&quot;<br />Franken is on the mark. Note that Coulter's words -- &quot;This from the party of Bella Abzug&quot; -- is implying that Bella Abzug is one among the ugliest women!	2003-11-10

Ann Coulter for example, misquotes, takes out of context, and blatantly fabricates much of the information she uses to support her propoganda.

His book is an amusing, honest, and scathing indictment of his enemies on the Right. Public persons who lie deserve to have their lies exposed so that we, the greater public, are better informed. And for that, Mr. Franken should be applauded.<br />Note that I said Franken's book is an &quot;...indictment of his enemies on the Right.&quot; While I believe Franken's facts to be accurate, I'm not sure that his attacks are &quot;fair&quot; since they are so very personal. This style of expose, while funny, almost comes off as simply the flip side to Ann Coulter. Still, I recommend this book to everyone who desires to engage in a dialogue beyond platitudes. Anything that illuminates the truth should be celebrated.<br />I have long thought that the media has become the &quot;opiate of the masses&quot; and much of Franken's book supports this hypothesis. What is most disturbing is Franken's assertion that many liars lie because they think their readers/viewers are too stupid to check their facts. I recently finished reading the book Culture of Fear by Barry Glassner, which illuminates some of the lies we are told to keep us in fear. The point is that the American public has an obligation to be skeptical. Don't just listen to pundits! If you're reading Gore Vidal, you should be reading Rumsfeld as well and making up your own mind. So read Franken. Then read Coulter. Check their sources. You decide.	2003-11-10

True enough, but Evan Thomas is the grandson of Norman.

This is a brilliant, and brilliantly funny, book.  (And it looks like a few other people have read it, too.)  The truth is, Al Franken isn't lying when he accuses his considerably less than honest subjects of lying.  He more than compellingly makes the case that, when faced with the choice between lying or not lying, the \\"lying liars\\" of the title will, almost inevitably, opt for the first choice (\\"lying\\").  Because he makes this case in a superbly witty fashion, the book is hilarious.  But, because the truths (and lies) involved are depressing and grim, \\"Lying Liars\\" is also-and I do not lie--depressing and grim.  Consequently, this title can make you laugh with anger and/or fume with amusement.  Franken is a genius.<br /> The most amazing thing about the countless lies laid-out by Franken is their utter artlessness.  One would think that a culture of fibs could survive (let alone thrive) only if the fibbers in question were cunning and crafty, but, for the most part, the truth-loose liberal-bashers in these pages lie first, and think never.  Take Bill \\"O'Lie-lly,\\" whose real life story (as opposed to the one he shares with his viewers) was uncovered by \\"TeamFranken\\" when someone on the team thought to consult with the Fox host's mother.  Who could have anticipated such a bold and unprecedented journalistic maneuver?  (Not the Fox star in question, apparently.)  Similarly, certain members of TeamBush (the president and vice-president, for example) choose their fibs with no consideration given to consequences and every consideration given to self-service.  Nothing, evidently, gets more in the way of a good and effective lie than forethought-or thought of any kind.  And here's where the press doesn't come in.  Franken shows us how, time and again, the \\"liberal\\" press gives a green light to right-lies in the interests of fairness--or, rather, an utterly skewered version of same in which the burden of proof is dumped on those who question lies, rather than those who callously concoct them.<br />Most of all, Franken's intention is to give the lying portion of the right a taste of its own patent medicine.  He bullies the bullies with a simple and effective comedic missile, one not to be found anywhere in the arsenals of his enemies.  I refer, of course, to the truth.llously concoct them.<br />Most of all, Franken's intention is to give the lying portion of the right a taste of its own patent medicine.

Franken's book is an unashamed wake up call to those who call themselves liberals to go out and fight and to re-take the political ground which has been won by the right over the past twenty years. He suggests that this is not an easy task as the media is conservative and radio is dominated by right wing ideologues. However his book is a demonstration of a means of fighting the good fight. <br />Franking demonstrates clearly that one of the tactics of the right in America is the oft-repeated bald face lie. If a lie is repeated enough it becomes a factoid that enters the political debate and if not countered can become an accepted truth. He lists countless examples of lies. Not factual mistakes or opinions but lies and shows how the conservative press seldom question them. This has led to the success of Bush and the Republicans in gaining the Presidency and more recently dominating congress. <br />The chapters on Ann Coulter are not earth shattering in saying anything new but Franken says it with a sense of humour lacking in others who have exposed her. The chapter on the media and on talk show hosts again is revealing. <br />Sometimes populists books are disregarded by serious academics as not researching what is a complex world. However sometimes populist books go to the very heart of a problem and expose it in a way that the most serious academic study cannot. Franklen's is one such book. One of the more entertaining and funny books to come out in years.	2003-11-09

If I were a fan of any of them, I'd like to think that I admired their points of view because it was based on fact, not lies and distortions. This book points out where these people are often wrong. One of my favorites was reading Ann Coulter's attack on the New York Times for failing to mention Dale Earnhard's death. Franken reproduces the front page of the NYT from the day after he died where, suprise!, there's an article about his life and death. It's blatant lies like that that make me wonder why people engage in intellectual dishonesty. Why not base your opinion on fact instead of distortions?	2003-11-09

Lets be perfectly frank about this incident shall we....this, sadly, was little more then a typical Rush Limbaugh/Far-Right radio bashing and personal attack on a child who was never in a position to defend herself. An incredibly juvenile act but one that we've come to expect from over-inflated gasbags such as Rush. Can anyone truly belive that Mr. Limbaugh and his cohorts made a 'harmless error' and then proceeded to feign innocence? How terribly convenient! Previous pro-Rush reviewers who expect us to buy into this 'innocent mistake' must also expect Americans to believe that this administrations policies in Iraq are all part of a grand scheme to bring Democracy to the Middle East. Please!! Now while this sad event should not be blown out of proportion it is unfortunately typical of far-Right 'talking heads' who seem to show an appalling lack of good judgement when whining ceaselessly as they do about Bill and Hillary Clinton.                         <br />Granted, many Conservative readers here ( and thanks for stopping by! ) will defend this far-Right bigot but how can any of us be surprised. God knows, we're talking about an individual who, two weeks ago, blamed the Clintons on his very own addiction to drugs. Yes, Rush Limbaugh, a man who apparently never met a Liberal he didn't hate, once again takes the 'high road' ( no pun! ) by absolving himself of any responsibility for his own pathetic behavior and blames Bill Clinton for his own weaknesses. Ya gotta love it! Mr. Limbaugh states that if it wasn't for the Clinton administrations lack of tackling the drug problem in this country head on our boy Rush would not be in the unenviable position he finds himself today. Apparently Mr. Limbaugh not only reveals himself to be a pathological liar ( something he shares in common with this White House ) but lacks any true back-bone and honesty. Again, raise your hands if you're really surprised by  these rather odorous turn of events. <br />Well, so  be it! No doubt Rush Limbaugh will soon return to the air-waves as a true martyr of the far-Right and he shall continue to bask in the extreme wealthy life-style that he has become accustomed to there in Palm Beach. God, who said this isn't a great country!?	2003-11-08

I'm sure many people would have &quot;preferred&quot; Buddy.

In fact, I would hire Al Franken's family and Chelsea Clinton for the Big Apple Circus just to save on makeup costs. It's why NOW and the American Kennel Club are interchangeable. It's why the &quot;L&quot; in LPGA doesn't stand for &quot;Ladies&quot;, if you know what I mean.<br />Anyhow, I recommend this book for Stepford liberals who need to redirect their self-loathing towards beautiful, rich people. The book is basically Al Franken sniping like a little schoolgirl at various conservative (i.e., smart) pundits. It's a good lesson in kindergarten humor (so-and-so is a nutcase, so-and-so is splotchy, etc.).<br />Franken knows ugly.

Limbaugh's lead-in was contrived, and clearly could have had no other purpose than to set up the joke:  Chelsea = dog.<br />Limbaugh said, &quot;We all know there's a White House cat.  But did you know there's a White House dog?&quot;  Then the photo was put up on the screen behind him.<br />I've seen the same debate elsewhere, many times.  Obviously the alternate transcript--which is nothing like what actually happened during the show--is being circulated not only in an attempt to banish to the memory hole Limbaugh's cruel taunting of a young teenage girl, but also to make critics of Limbaugh appear to be liars.<br />As if Limbaugh's defenders are concerned with truth!<br />Franken sometimes exaggerates or embellishes in order to be more entertaining and to make his point more clear.

It's clear they suffer from a unique pathology that is slowly driving them insane. They are, at their core, very, VERY afraid. They are afraid because ultimately, they are ignorant. They are ignorant of much of the world that exists outside their own. This basic ignorance leads to their overwhelming and permanent state of fear. The fear quickly paralyzes them and they become consumed with placating all supposed adversaries. They are too afraid or to selfish to placate their supposed adversaries themselves so instead they want the government to do it.<br /><br />Since I do not suffer from this fear concept and I do not need a tome of propaganda I found this book to be incipiently tedious.<br /><br />Caveat Emptor	2003-11-08

I think Buzz Patterson's review is worth posting again:<br />&quot;As Far as I Know --- It's Lies,<BR>One of the earlier reviewers challenged a review that stated Franken's book contained untruths. As President Clinton's military aide from 1996-1998 and the author of the also New York Times best seller &quot;Dereliction of Duty,&quot; I can state categorically that Franken's statements regarding Clinton's performance as our commander-in-chief are categorically untrue. Our armed forces currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are definitively NOT Clinton's military as Franken claims. The facts are this: Clinton reduced our military by 1/3 to 1/2 depending on which military service you are talking about. Morale reached an all-time low, due in fact that Clinton chose to hold himself to a lower standard behaviorally than the most junior enlisted member in any service. His behavior would have resulted in not only courts martial but jail if he'd been a sargeant or a captain. While he cut military pay and procurements over his 8 years, he deployed us over 44 times to such &quot;hotbeds&quot; as Haiti, Sierra Leone, and Rwanda while refusing to take on the real wars, terrorism, Iraq and North Korea. Previous presidents deployed our military 8 times in the previous 45 years. In my opinion, he's directly responsible for 9-11, Iraq, and the rising problems in North Korea. Where do you think North Korea obtained their nuclear capabilites and China the ability to hit the US with nukes? Umm, the Clinton Administration? Check the facts, Al. He and his wife had a disdain and distrust for the military that was palpable. Ask any military member during the 90's. Most of us chose to &quot;vote with our feet&quot; and left in record numbers. I can't speak to the other issues that Franken raises, and yes I've read the book, but his &quot;take&quot; as a military pundit is far from factual. I'm no expert in domestic politics or the media but I do know a little about command and moral authority. As a veteran of Grenada, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, and the Persian Gulf, I have a resume. Clinton didn't have it and Franken is wrong. I won't tell jokes across the country and Franken shouldn't paint himself as an expert on national defense. Who's lying now Al?&quot;<br />Hmm, let's see, so far Franken has lied about the abstinence stories, and he's lied about &quot;Clinton's army&quot;.  Sorry, Al, but my review goes down a star.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book (many a good out loud laugh) and found it instructive at the same time.  Franken had a team of Harvard students helping him research and they turned up reams of flagrant lies, some silly and some insidious that the \\"right\\" utters incessantly until they believe their own lies.  He demolishes Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity and company.  He shows how Cheney lies reflexively, for example, making a pious speech about the dead in Arlington Cemetery describing \\"rows of crosses\\" which don't exists at Arlington Cemetery... It turns out that the imagery of the speech was lifted from a poem about Flanders.  There is a skit about who benefits from Bush tax cuts.  In 4 simple pages, Franken demonstrates how the lower/middle classes will be worse off.  This book clearly shows the right wing media creatures and the Bushies are not just totally dishonest but stupid and slipshod as well.	2003-11-07

Al Franken is so funny, his humor is dry, extremely witty and right on the mark. Sometimes I would read something he said and think he was serious and then realize he was making a very clever joke. It is honestly extremely funny and entertaining!<br />His chapters on Anne Coutler and Bill O'Reilly were my favorite. They are both nuts and he goes after them with vigor. He points out about a zillion errors in Anne's books and can back them up with proof. He gives many examples on how O'Reilly is nothing more than a bully with a big mouth.<br />His book is EXTREMELY well researched, well written, easy to understand and everything he claims can be proven to be true. He does not throw around statements that have no merit, he proves others to be liars while keeping his book 100% truthful and yes I even looked into some of his claims out of curiousity and found them to be true.<br />A really,really good read and highly recommended!	2003-11-07

I immediately checked the jacket for photo credits, since I figured a picture this bad had to be doctored somehow.  I found that the photo was taken by Nancy Kaszerman of Zuma.  I checked Zuma's website and found that she does indeed work for them in New York City, where O'Reilly lives and works.  So that part checked out, in addition to being pretty funny (I showed the pic to my roommate and we both had a good laugh).<br />As I read the book it became clear that the cover anecdote had set a pattern for the book: a good laugh and solid basis for the politics behind the laugh.  Franken skewers the conservative Holy Trinity of O'Reilly, Coulter and Hannity with both his trademark smartass wit and a basic knowledge of Google.  I particularly like his curt exchange with Paul Wolfowitz (page 212) and think it perfectly illustrates how this White House treats its political rivals--with a flag in one hand and an outsretched middle finger on the other.  My only complaint was with Franken's sometimes Pollyannaesque (is that the right word?  Is that even a word?) portrayal of Bill Clinton.  While nobody in their right mind really believes that Clinton killed *all* those people, Franken fails to address the shadiness (real or imagined, take your pick) that surrounds Clinton's legacy and its negative effect on today Democratic Party.  But I guess the book wasn't about that anyway.<br />All in all, good reading.  I bought it at 6PM and finished it at 2AM the same day.  And that's not because I have no life.  Really.  It isn't.	2003-11-07

The two read like chapters of the same book, The Enron Presidency.<br /><br />Economists and forensic accountants will make careers over the next few decades unraveling the fraud Franken describes.  The brilliance of using the government itself to run a trillion dollar sting is breath-taking.  Having been in the fraud detection business myself, I was deeply impressed by Team Franken's work.	2003-11-06

I have seen and heard many criticisms of this book, and the vast majority of them are BS.  For instance, I heard on local radio that Al had hidden the fact that 14 Harvard students helped research the book.  It was obvious that none of the people on the air had read the book, because he states this up front and has a bio of every 'Team Franken' member at the end.  Another said that if you are concerned with which side lies more, you probably aren't interested in the truth.  Well, it matters to me and everyone I've talked to about this, and the Right lies more than the left. A lot more.  For every Michael Moore there is a squad of Coulters, O'Reillys, Limbaughs, Hannitys, Bernard Goldbergs, etc.<br />This book is a breath of much needed fresh air.	2003-11-06

He assumes to correct an earlier reviewer from SF with his dead-on, rightful lecturing of another lost soul-and his first \\"point\\" he capitalizes on is the pettiest nitpicking of whether the reviewer from SF addressed whom he was referring to by his actual last name. Lousy!<br />Orniston resisted the indisputable fact that the only reason Russia, France and Germany so difficultly vetoed the last UN resolution was because of economic interests. This amounts to blasphemy on Orniston's part. It's been awfully over-documented that all 3 countries had nothing BUT an economic interest with Iraq.<br />First is the business of UN sanctions against Iraqi oil. France and Russia refused for sanctions to be lifted, on numerous occasions, just as Chirac wanted to continue those sanctions even after war was over. The reason for this is because France and Russia both depended critically on their own oil exports to support their sagging economies. With Iraqi oil on the market, France and Russia would have been excommunicated in being able to sell their own oil, because Iraqi oil's just cheaper. Chirac gloated merrily while Hussein was laying the \\"smackdown\\"-so to speak-on his own people, because all Chirac cared about was protecting his oil exports.<br />It's been arduously documented that Russia had wickedly substantial interests in Iraq, namely a debt of 8 billion that, obviously now, won't be paid off to those commies. Germany and France's gluttony has also been documented, regarding how they built infrastructure for Hussein (bunkers, ammunitions buildings), and likely sold them weapons technologies too.<br />Sadly, these facts are willfully concealed by libs like Orniston, as are truths that honorable countries-like Australia-who was Iraq's 2nd largest trading partner, had no qualms about opposing Hussein for the greater good!<br />The only countries that DIDN'T have economic interests in Iraq but still opposed war were only the lowest of third-world sinkholes-meaning they were mislead by fundamentalist thinking in their respective countries that exploited their shabby economic situations, which are mostly the faults of their policies.<br />Orniston's a democratic apologist-he unaccountably bypasses the free will soldiers have to decide whether to join or not, and blames it on rich men sending kids to die. ASININE. Further, it's Iraqi resistance guerrillas who're killing soldiers-yet annoyance Orniston again wants to brainwash with his conspiracy theories that the Bush Admin. is a plutocracy!<br />Lastly, deceptions WEREN'T used \\"as excuses for war\\". America and its coalition didn't base the liberation of Iraq on Hussein buying uranium from Africa-or that Hussein was within 45-minutes of immediately using WMD! Orniston and all his like-mined, brain-decayed PC zombies need to get their minds out of the gutter, because the Admin.'s maintained from the start they wanted to oust Hussein because of his CAPABILITY to build WMD, terrorism ties and the inference of him possessing WMD because he never let inspectors freely inspect, nor did he account for all his weapons!<br />If this is the spoilt-to-the-core infection that resides in liberals' minds; like Orniston, like Franken, like the DNC-then they're all contemptible!	2003-11-06

And unlike the people he criticizes, he backs up what he says and says it with humor, unlike the vitriolic hatred of those he writes about. <br />The screeching harpies of the right, like Ann Coulter, deride people that disagree with them as hating America. But in Frankens's book, I see nothing but love for one of the greatest  nations on earth or in history (not necessarily \\"the greatest\\" - that's partly what they consider hating America, refusing to see value in other cultures or opinions). They are the ones that hate everything America is and stands for.<br />I work with a Limbaugh/Coulter \\"dittohead\\". Nice enough fellow, but the other day he was complaining again to someone about life in America, and caught himself just in time as he said \\"I ha..... no, I don't don't hate this country, but....\\". But he does. While he caught himself before he said it, it's what he feels. He hates America, and so do Franken's targets. <br />They should remember their own slogans from the 60's. \\"America - Love It Or Leave It\\". I love it.  And I'm staying.

And if we were to debate this topic, it might even turn into a heated discussion. But ultimately I can respect Mr. Frankin's right to his beliefs on gun control without labeling him a \\"commie\\" or a Socialist. And I feel quite certain that Mr. Frankin could respect my right to my beliefs on the right to keep and bear arms without accusing me of being a Nazi. Folks, in case anyone has forgotten, this is what America is supposed to be about. <br />As a conservative American, I do not want to be associated with the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, or, for that matter, George W. Bush and his cronies. Since 9/11, these demagogues have spearheaded a national movement of lies, deceit, fear mongering, phony patriotism, and propaganda to rally unwitting Americans behind Bush's completely irresponsible and self-serving political agenda. And as Frankin so adeptly points out, these people will shamelessly resort to name calling, distortions, verbal abuse, and guilt (e.g., \\"If you don't agree with me you aren't a good American\\") to coerce Americans to step in line with their own ill-conceived agendas. People, what we are witnessing here isn't about conservatism, and it isn't about patriotism -- it's borderline Fascism. <br />What really scares me is that millions of \\"patriotic\\" Americans have put on their blinders and eagerly jumped on to this impending train wreck without giving the first moment's thought as to where it is leading this country. It just doesn't seem to bother them that \\"W\\" is shackling us and our children with trillions of dollars in deficits while placing tens of thousands of Americans in harm's way waging an overseas war that has nothing to do with counter-terrorism. And if you suggest that the money being squandered on this fruitless and counter productive war effort might be better spent on efforts to revive a sick economy and putting millions of displaced American workers back on the payroll, these \\"patriots\\" angrily accuse you of being an Al Qaeda wannabe. Is it time to break out the brown shirts yet? <br />For my money, Frankin is right on target with this one. To my way of thinking he is a true patriot because he openly goes against the grain of the \\"conventional\\" wisdom and questions the motives and integrity of the self-anointed political pundits, as well as exposing the sorry state of our current political leadership. And lest anyone has forgotten, in a democratic society the freedom to question our government is not only our right, it is also our responsibility. The day we forget that is the day we all give up our freedom. <br />This book is well worth reading regardless of whether your political leanings are to the left or the right. It is an easy read, it is humorous, and it is timely. And it should be read keeping in mind the principles on which this country was founded, not one's political party preference.	2003-11-06

I remember seeing him years ago as part of the Franken and Davis comedy team and I couldn't stand them, but then a while back Davis disappeared and Al started doing political humor.  Suddenly, he became a lot funnier, and now I own three of his books.<br />This book is his revenge on the right wing media and politicians.  He exposes them as liars and shows us the lies they have told, then gives evidence to show that they are wrong, and that they know they are wrong when they are lying to us.<br />He shows us that the whole liberal media thing is a myth.  When you stop and think about it, it's pretty obvious that there is almost no liberal representation in the broadcast media.  The blowhards on the radio and TV talkshows are speaking from the right wing.  The print media seems a bit more liberal, but as he points out in the book, a recent study shows that most editors and publishers are more conservative than the general public.<br />If you are a liberal, you'll love this book.  If you're a conservative, you may find yourself laughing a few times (even though you probably won't be too happy about it).  If you're somewhere in the middle, you may not enjoy it as much as your liberal friends, but you'll probably get a kick out of some of the stories.<br />The only drawback in this book, is that it's depressing to see how the right wing spokespeople have gotten away with their lies for so long.  It's about time somebody exposed them for what they are.	2003-11-05

Jon asked him a long, drawn-out question about why it fell to Al Franken to write a book exposing the lies and half-truths of the right-wings pundits.  After all, Jon asked, isn't the mainstream media policing itself and tearing all the Limbaugh-Hannity-Coulter crap to shreds?  After this long, 30-second, serious question, Franken paused, looked away for a second, and just said, &quot;no&quot; (that the media wasn't doing its job).  <br />This one-word answer sums up the frustration and delight that come with reading Franken's book.  It is a well-written, funny, nicely-researched, and angry volume.  For those who read progressive news on a regular basis, there is nothing new here.  But it's disconcerting that it takes humorists to get people's attention regarding our most important public issues.  If the American people (I balk at using the word &quot;citizens,&quot; because of general American idiocy) would pay as much attention to serious journalism as they do to the latest flavors of Doritos, then maybe Al Franken and his ilk could go back to show business where they belong.  <br />But I do recommend this book.

For one thing, Franken states flatly that George W. Bush, in his younger days, used cocaine.<br />Who knows? Maybe he did. But Franken has no evidence. And he certainly knows that during the 2000 campaign, reporters from major news organizations spent many hours searching - unsuccessfully - for proof of Bush drug use. <br />But who cares - Bush is a lying liar, right?<br />And not just about drugs. About more important things, too - like taxes. Franken delves into the old argument about the president's tax cut: Democrats say more money went to upper income taxpayers, while Republicans say lower-income taxpayers received proportionally bigger cuts.<br />Both are correct, but Franken settles it by simply pronouncing the Republicans lying liars. He does so on the basis of the kind of \\"thorough\\" TeamFranken research that so impressed Alex Jones - in this case, apparently reading press handouts from left-leaning advocacy groups.<br />On May 26, 2001 the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a press release which, citing research by the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, said, \\"The bottom 60 percent of the population would receive 14.7 percent of the tax cuts.\\" In Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken writes of the tax cuts, \\"The truth is that the bottom 60 percent got 14.7 percent.\\" <br />Did it really take a gaggle of research assistants to come up with that?<br />In a chapter entitled \\"Vast Lagoons of Pig Feces: The Bush Environmental Record,\\" Franken labels George W. Bush \\"the worst environmental president in our nation's history.\\" As an example, he accuses the Bush administration of gutting Bill Clinton's proposed regulations to solve waste problems at giant livestock farms, which are known in the agriculture business as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs. <br />But Franken wants to be fair. While Bush's policy hasbeen terrible, he writes, \\"To be totally honest, I wish the Clinton administration had done more to address the pig s**t problem. But at least he [Clinton] was pushing in the right direction. Toward the end of his administration, the EPA issued stringent new CAFO regulations....\\"<br />What Franken does not mention is that the Environmental Protection Agency issued the new CAFO regulations on December 15, 2000. That was certainly toward the end of the Clinton administration, and it was also two days after the presidential election was settled, which meant that everyone finally knew that George W. Bush, and not Al Gore, would be the next president. And that is when the Clinton administration, which had been in office for nearly eight years, decided to get tough on CAFOs. (In addition, the new regulations would not take effect until after a four-month waiting period, at which point Clinton would be long gone.)<br />Did TeamFranken give you the whole story? You decide.<br />There's more along those lines, accusing Bush and the GOP of lying about Iraq, education, the environment - pretty much everything. But to Al Franken, Republicans are not just lying liars. They are very bad people. For example, Franken is angry about racism, which he associates almost exclusively with the GOP.<br />He writes that when he gives corporate speeches, he begins by saying, \\"Looking out at your faces today, I can see that this group hasn't caved in to that whole affirmative action nonsense.\\" He says audiences \\"look around, see all the white faces, and laugh.\\"<br />The funny thing is, one could say the same at a meeting of TeamFranken. Judging by a photo published at the end of the book, it appears that Franken's crew has no African-American members. TeamFranken - made up of a grossly disproportionate number of white males - does not look like America.<br />That small hypocritical note wouldn't matter much were Franken not throwing so many stones. But he is - from the glass house built for him by the Shorenstein Center.	2003-11-05

Putting a humorous spin on things makes it enjoyable to read, as well.  I thrilled at reading so many instances of catching people outright lying to the public, and on that merit I rate the book very highly.  (I think people on the 'left' often lie as well, mind you, but that's obviously not going to be the focus of this book - it's unfortunate everyone feels the need to choose one of two sides these days and come out swinging.)<br />However, I feel that sometimes his personal feelings on issues cloud his presentation of 'facts'.  For example, I understand he was affected deeply by the death of a friend, and the attacks by the 'right' surrounding the memorial service were over-the-top and generally unfounded, but I think that most people would agree it degenerated into a tasteless display at times which Mr. Franken seemed to imply was merely somewhat inappropriate.  I find it easy to believe that someone could have no problem with prostitution but be offended by disrespect for the dead, something Mr. Franken seems to disagree with me on in his take on Jesse Ventura's reaction.<br />This is a book about uncovering lies, though, and lies he finds in abundance.  I strongly recommend this book, but suggest balancing what you get from it by doing some of your own research - watch/read some of the shows/books he bashes and decide for yourself.  While I find some folks like Coulter beyond redemption, I think O'Reilly's show can be interesting at times.<br />On a side note, I've noticed a tendancy of some reviewers to disagree with one point made in the book (for example, a former soldier's take on the &quot;Clinton military&quot; section) and then rate it one star.  He made his case, but then discredited it by giving the book the lowest possible rating when it seemed to be the only issue he had with it.  My point?  Apparently the &quot;bash mentality&quot; embraced by this and similar books on the 'right' catches on... let's hope most people leave it in the realm of humour.	2003-11-05

People who don't see that while reading this book simply don't get the point of the book: The hardcore right-wingers writing supposedly serious books bashing liberals are merely insulting their readers' intelligence.  <BR>The biggest traitors in America today are Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter who are merely pawns in a corporatist attack on life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

By his own account, the self-appointed scourge of right-wing lies and liars has something of a truth problem himself. But let him tell the story:<br />April 21, 2003<br />Dear Attorney General Ashcroft,<br />I am currently a fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where I am working on a book about abstinence programs in our public schools entitled, Savin' It: The book's fourth chapter, &quot;Role Modelin' It!,&quot; will feature the personal stories of abstinence heroes for our nation's young people to emulate . . . I would very much appreciate it if you could share your abstinence story. So far, I have received wonderful testimonies from HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, William J. Bennett, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, Cardinal Egan, Senator Rick Santorum, and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. (I'm still hoping to hear back from the President!)<br />And so on. The letter was a pretty obvious con, and none of the 28 people to whom Franken sent it was fooled. Somebody even tipped off the Kennedy School that Franken was misusing its stationery. He apologized to Harvard--but not to any of his intended victims.<br />Anybody can type out a deceitful letter. (Well, almost anybody.) To lie to people's faces--and to do it over and over again--requires a more hardened character. Franken, though, is up to the challenge.<br />Franken might well excuse these excursions into deception as comedy--pure entertainment. But that only raises another mystery: how does a man who values truth so highly as Franken says he does, and is so plainly eager to have his readers think him a nice guy, convince himself that it is OK to deceive people in order to lure them into doing foolish things that will cause others to laugh at them? Is that not compounding deceit with cruelty?<br />And yet, even Al Franken's keenest fans may sense that, in most of the &quot;lies&quot; he detects, there is (shall we say) a lack of oomph. Who would lay out $24.95 to be told that George W. Bush's claim to have eliminated income taxes for millions of low-income taxpayers is a lie because it says nothing about payroll and excise taxes? If that kind of thing gets you excited, there are ten Democratic presidential candidates who will say it to you for free--and, if you live in Iowa or New Hampshire, even throw in a steak dinner or fish fry to thank you for listening.<br />Not that Franken is unamusing: there are bits of Lies that might elicit chuckles even from those who do not share his politics:<br />&quot;God chose me to write this book . . The reason I know God chose me is because God spoke to me personally. God began our conversation by clearing something up. Some of George W. Bush's friends say that Bush believes God called him to be President during these times of trial. But God told me that He/She/It had actually chosen Al Gore by making sure that Gore the popular vote and, God thought, the electoral college.<br />Overall it can be entertaining at some points, but hardly to be considered at all a serious political book.  It should in fact be placed in the satire section.  You want real political comedy, buy Give War a Chance by P. J. O'Rourke.

Upon finishing this book I can tell you, it is extremely difficult to imagine a sincere conservative even stomaching the first 100 pages of this book.<br />The reason is simple. Al Franken, a comedian and a liberal advocate, is assigned a team of 14 Harvard students with a mission to write a book that will counter the recent surge of attacks by the conservative right against the US liberals. Why a comedian, you might wonder? Well, because the charges they will come up with are extremely aggressive, and only when presented with a satirical sense of humor can they be toned down a bit for the average non-biased reader.<br />The main charge is right there on the cover. US conservative icons are liars. Al acknowledges the direness of this charge when he says that &quot;lying is a serious matter. And calling the President of the United States a liar is not something I say with any relish or self-satisfaction. I wish with all my heart that our president wasn't a liar, or if he were, that he was more like President Clinton. Bush lies about important things. Like the economy, his tax cuts, education, our reasons for going to war, and drunk driving.&quot; He also accuses others of lying such as Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Rush Limbaugh among other conservative celebrities.<br />And as serious as these accusations are, so are the facts and the arguments Al extends in support of these claims. With the help of a meticulous research team, Al reveals shocking and horrifying lies that some conservatives have been shamelessly voicing to the public. Some of these lies could be blamed on ignorance and insufficient research, but others cannot be attributed to anything but utter evilness and the desire to hide the truth.<br />Al begins the book by bashing Ann Coulter, the author of &quot;Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism.&quot; Not only does Mr. Franken reveal so many shortcomings in the methodology used by Ann to research information about the liberal media (such as improper usage of the LexisNexis search engine,) but he also reveals inexcusable out-of-context quotations that were presented with obvious ill intentions. That, in addition to other outright lies mentioned in her book as well.<br />Then he takes on Bernard Goldberg, the author of &quot;Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distorts the News.&quot; And again, he reveals a malicious misquoting approach similar to that of his fellow conservative Ms. Coulter. And don't think that these takes on misquotations are mere cheap-shots taken at side issues of these books. These misquotations are central to the basic premise of the arguments by the conservative authors, and Al presents you the original full text, the context it was said in, and then the mutilated presentation by the author. By finishing those chapters you'd laugh (or cry) every time you see one of those books on display.<br />Subsequently, Al wages a deadly assault on FOX along with its star Bill O'Reilly. I'm surprised that anyone can go through that chapter and not end up with a strong feeling of despise for the O'Reilly man. Al also takes on Hannity and Colmes as well.<br />After that, Al goes on a campaign to repeal all the lies that the conservative propaganda machine has been spreading for several years. Al covers various subjects such as the 2000 elections, the war on terrorism, the tone of politics in Washington, and the Paul Wellstone memorial. Al also doesn't forget to discuss some pillars of the conservative school of thought, such as abstinence for birth-control, conservatives stand on racism and feminism, supply-side economics, and the sissiness of the Democrats. Finally, he briefly discusses his own uncharacteristic support of the Iraqi preemption war.<br />The watertight logic and the hard evidence that Al extends in this book are astonishingly unexpected from a comedian interested in politics such as Al Franken. I was expecting to get some laughs at the conservative right only to be amazed by the strong and sometimes infallible arguments that Al throws in the face of conservatives.<br />But make no mistake about it, the book is more hysterical than all of Al's previous work. If you have seen Al on TV before you'll know that his comedy is not based on observations and funny comments only. Al is the kind of guy who would engage himself in confrontations (sometimes under dangerous circumstances) to present you a real-life funny story. Many of these stories are presented in this book along with a mini-novel about what would Bush's team have done have they didn't dodge the service in Vietnam, a comic titled &quot;The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus&quot; (which was extremely funny,) and a no-child-left-behind standard test.<br />Also, in credit for Al's work, none of those accused by him as liars was able to defend himself against this serious accusation. In addition to the public confrontations where Al left his opponents stumped and speechless, FOX and O'Reilly couldn't find any vulnerabilities in the book to sue against except for its title. And no, not the &quot;Liars&quot; part, but the &quot;Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot; part claiming that it's a patented slogan of the O'Reilly Factor show. This alone is telling of to what extent the conservatives are defenseless against being called liars. They lost even that case, by the way.<br />In conclusion, if you're sick of conservatives waving Coulter's books or Goldberg's and would want to stump them cold silent, then read this book. If you want to learn more about how easy it is to lie in public without being caught, then read this book. If you're looking for great humor, then read this book. If you're a conservative with high blood-pressure, then I recommend that you do not read this book. You will not find it funny.	2003-11-04

For those people--there seem to be quite a few among the reviewers--who can't tell the difference between when Franken is kidding and when he is being serious, it is helpful to listen to him read his work. You can tell by his tone when he is presenting facts and when he is making them up for humorous effect. <br />And whether one is a liberal or a conservative, one truth you can glean from this book is that it is extremely difficult for the average layperson to know when anyone in the media is telling the truth or making it up. Ideologues, no matter which side they are on--liberal or conservative--and no matter who they work for, should never be implicitly trusted. We should, as Franken often does in this book when he is serious, take the time to check and authenticate claims we hear in the media. But we, the public, are usually either too lazy, too busy, or too willing to accept or reject a claim because we agree or disagree already based on our pre-conceived notions. <br />Whether or not you like Al Franken's political views or enjoy his humor, he does us a service by pointing out how often and how egregiously facts are distorted and fiction is presented as fact in the media.	2003-11-03

I moved to NYC for a few months and actually had to work and converse with actual conservatives -- and I soon realized that I'd gotten so used to being surrounded by people whose politics are similar to my own that I couldn't quote chapter and verse about why I believe what I believe. Sure, Dick Cheney is an evil man -- but why do I think so? Sure, Al Gore was a great candidate and should have been President -- but what about all those lies he allegedly told? <br />Franken's book, while certainly humorous, is also an incredibly well-researched work. After reading it, I'm well-prepared to argue the points I find myself arguing with my Republican friends. More importantly, it encouraged me to consume media in a much more critical way than I had been in the past (there were aspects of the conservative agenda that I'd completely swallowed, simply because I kept hearing the same falsehoods repeated by multiple sources). <br />Thanks, Al.

Rather, <BR>I laughed at the ludicrous distortions (i.e. LIES) used by AL to &quot;prove&quot; his points.  Franken takes the usual implicit approach that liberalism is morally and ethically superior to consevatism (or any other competing viewpoint!).  Those espousing a conservative viewpoint must be duplicitous, and just a little bit stupid (hee hee).   Hence it is OK for Franken to tell whatever lie he needs to prove his point because he is on the side of VIRTUE.

First of all, the book has a lot of merit on humor alone.  Even if you completely disagree with Franken, there are a few chapters that you can't help but laugh at.  The difficulty in a book like this, then, is trying to fit the humor in with the serious political commentary.  Sometimes it's hard to tell what's serious and what's not, and, in fact, the first time I ever read a book by him, I was left thinking he lied all the time.  It really seemed to undermine his intent, which was to dissect various ideological opponents of his, often by accusing them of lying.  As I read more of his work and gave it more thought, I got to where I could pretty routinely tell when he was kidding around and when he was being serious.  <br />There are three types of lies he tells.  The first is a sort of dramatization lie, where what he says is basically true but he takes a little license in the telling so that the story is funnier.  You can't always tell when he's doing this, but that doesn't really matter because it's tangential to the point he's making.  The second sort of lie is really obvious.  He might claim, for example, that Rush Limbaugh has a gay younger brother that he used to beat up as a kid (to my knowledge, he has never claimed this).  These sorts of lies are generally obvious and used purely for cheap laughs (he usually adds disclaimers to them, in fact).  The third type of lie is more subtle.  Often he'll give an example of something he's been talking about within his work.  In one chapter, he talks about a technique some people use to mislead their readers, and then actually does it himself right there.  He does it nowhere else in the book, so clearly he's using it as a sort of subtle tool to further deride the person he's making fun of and illustrate how underhanded the technique is.  In any case, it is easy to mistake these sorts of \\"lies\\" for the sorts of things he accuses his opponents of, but if readers keep his tone and intent in mind, they should never accusehim of hypocrisy.	2003-11-01

So take the review at whatever value you'd now like to.  That said, I found the book to be mixed in  both its humor and effectiveness.  Part of the reason I think is that this book is much less focused than his earlier book on Rush.  Having a single focus in that book allowed Franken to bore in on topic, to have a sense of cohesion and chronology.  Here, going after all the right, the effect is much more diffuse.  Some sections are sharp and funny,  others are mostly funny, and some aren't particularly funny at all (for instance, the chickenhawk short story which has its moments but goes on way too long).  The other major problem Franken himself alludes to in his introduction when he says it was like shooting fish in a barrel.  People like Coulter and Hannity are such obvious clowns--unserious people who come out and do some shtick while behind the scenes the serious, talented people are getting ready to do serious work--they are such obvious clowns that pointing out their &quot;clownishness&quot; is just too obvious.  When Coulter basically says all democrats are traitors to their country, it isn't particularly perceptive to point out that she's an idiot.  So Franken's subjects fail him more often than his style.  And because he tries to get all of them, he is forced to skim through  leaving him open to O'reilly's charge of &quot;that's all you got?&quot; (though it's pretty clear it isn't).  There are strong moments in this book, both in terms of serious discussion of policy contrasts and in laugh-out-loud lines and images. He has good numbers to  back up most of his points, so it doesn't read simply as a rant.  It's a quick read thanks to his style so even if you find it uneven you quickly get through the worse sections and back into the strong ones.  Overall, it's a good light-hearted but with a serious bite look at the more obvous fools of the right.   A good browse-through book.  If you're looking for a more in-depth debunking of the right's favorite war cries, I'd go to Joe Conason's book.  If you want an in-depth, sharply critical look at Bush's policies with a bit of edgy humor, go to Molly Ivin's Bushwhacked.  But if you want to laugh out loud a few times, feel a little mean but guiltily satisfied, pick up this one.	2003-10-31

If anything, it's helping his career!  You may have remembered the interview O'Reilly had with Terry Gross on \\"Fresh Air\\" where Jeffrey A. Dvorkin claimed the interview was totally biased and &quot;unfair to O'Reilly.&quot; Isn't that great?!  NPR a liberal station admitting its own liberal bias!  Here's more from Dvorkin:  <br />&quot;I believe the listeners were not well served by this interview.  Unfortunately, the interview only served to confirm the belief, held by some, in NPR's liberal bias.  By coming across as a pro-Franken partisan rather than a neutral and curious journalist, Gross did almost nothing that might have allowed the interview to develop.  By the time the interview was about halfway through, it felt as though Terry Gross was indeed `carrying Al Franken's water,' as some listeners say.  It was not about O'Reilly's ideas, or his attitudes or even about his book.  It was about O'Reilly as political media phenomenon.  That's a legitimate subject for discussion, but in this case, it was an interview that was, in the end, unfair to O'Reilly.&quot;  <br />O'Reilly told Gross off justifiably.  Here's a partial transcript:<br />\\"O'REILLY, BEST-SELLING AUTHOR OF WHO'S LOOKING OUT FOR YOU?:  I came on to this program to talk about Who's Looking Out for You?  And what you've done is thrown every kind of defamation you can in my face.  Did you do this to Al Franken?  Did you?  Did you challenge him on what he said? <br />GROSS, HOST, FRESH AIR:  We had a different interview.  <br />O'REILLY:  Yes.  A different interview.  Okay.  Fine, fresh air?  Is this what &quot;fresh air&quot; is?  I'll get a transcript of this interview --you want me--of the Al  Franken interview.  You want me to do that, and compare the two? <br />GROSS:  You're welcome to.  <br />O'REILLY:  And compared it, too?  All right, why don't you tell your listeners right now?  Were you as tough on Al Franken as you are on me? No.  You weren't.  <br />GROSS:  No, I wasn't.  <br />O'REILLY:  Okay.  Why? <br />GROSS:  Well, Al Franken had written a book of political satire.  <br />O'REILLY:  Oh, he was satire now, was it?  All right, calling people liars and distorting their faces on the book cover.  That's satire now, is it?  And my book, Who's Looking Out for You? is designed to help people to show them how they have to know how to read people in the society to succeed.  Yet you're easy on Franken and you challenge me. This is NPR. <br />Okay?  I think we all know what this is.  I think we all know where you're going with this.  Don't we? <br />GROSS:  Well, you could say... <br />O'REILLY:  Yes, don't we? <br />GROSS:  You can think whatever you want to.  <br />O'REILLY:  I am.  I mean, I'm evaluating this interview very closely.  Obviously you are. Now we've spent now, all right, 50 minutes of me being -- defending defamation against me in every possible way, while you gave Al Franken a complete pass on his defamatory book.  And if you think that's fair, Terry, then you need to get in another business.  I'll tell you that right now.  And I'll tell your listeners, if you have the courage to put this on the air, this is basically an unfair interview designed to try to trap me into saying something that Harpers magazine can use.  And you know it.  And you should be ashamed of yourself.  And that is the end of this interview.\\"<br />Yup, gotta love those liberal medias.  Speaking of which, did you know that 45 percent of Americans believe the media is liberal, while only 14 percent think it's conservative.  Don't believe me?

Anyway, Al, you can continue to brainwash all 14 percent of Americans to your blind ideology while 45 percent of us will continue our suspicion of the liberal elite.  <br />Good day, <br />Coolguy<br />PS Will you EVER respond to your lie in chapter 33 and 34?<BR>PPS By the way, chapter 7 has a grammatical error (page 44): \\"How many times do you have be [there it is] misquoted before you learn not to ever say anything to anyone that could possibly be taken out of context and changed to make you look bad?\\" Just a reminder for your paperback.	2003-10-31

The thing that will make you really mad is just how much of it YOU YOURSELF did not know was untrue.    Now, is that a problem, to have massive segments of the society not just permeated by lies repeated ad infinitum, but completely dominated by huge, fundamental lies, lies that practically cry out for the righteous footsoldier to rise up and annihiliate all the social rot that's accumulated since the insidious advent of Port Huron Liberalism, or even since the passing of the socialist-inspired Wagner or Keating-Owen Acts?

Chapters such as \\"I'm A Bad Liar,\\" \\"Fun With Racism,\\" and \\"The 2000 Presidential Election: How It Disproved The Hypothetical Liberal Media Paradigm Matrix\\" are absolutely hilarious (\\"Bush was lying throughout the 2000 campaign.

The \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" and \\"The Gospel Of Supply-Side Jesus\\" short stories are less than stellar, too.<br />But past that, Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them is pure gold.

Unlike days past where it was just an owner's Citizen Kane-like tactics that ruled the copy room -- it now falls to the corporate deals made in the back rooms with the good-ol'-boys to determine what is reported and what is muffled.<br />And then there is Al Franken -- who tosses LIBERAL and CONSERVATIVE around like the dollar signs they represent.  He is bright, funny, and his teeth are sharp.  And he consistantly reminds us that however high-minded people are when proclaiming motives -- when it comes down to it, in materialist America, you can usually just follow the money and it will take you to the cash register of real motivations.  It is money that drives current environmental policy; it is money that drives current international policy; it is money that drives current human rights policies; and it is money that drives the little engine that can't manaage to report the news in a responsible way.	2003-10-31

I wanted to see some verifiable facts and proof of the so-called &quot;Liars&quot; and the &quot;Lies&quot; that he claims come from the conservative-viewed talk-show and TV hosts that seem to be so dominant in American media today.  I DID NOT want to see a book of conservative-bashing rhetoric, full of unresearchable and unverifiable opinion and conjecture---those kind of books are boring and repetitous---like the liberal-bashing Sean Hannity book, Let Freedom Ring. Well, I was not disappointed at all. With the exception of a few excerpts that were rather harsh and could be construed as &quot;unverifiable opinion&quot; of someone or an actual event (and usually Mr. Franken would note this), this book was thoroughly researched and referenced. I took pains to actually verify a few of his facts, just to be sure. I also spent time going over reviews from &quot;critics&quot; of this book and found only a handful of criticisms, mostly made up of getting mad at Mr. Franken and calling him meaningless bad names, but no real factual rebuttals or anything of substance. I don't listen to people who get mad and name-call because they disagree. Give me the facts and back up your claims! Mr. Franken does just that and I highly recommend this book to people who aren't afraid to hear the facts and not just meaningless drivel from someone who thinks that same as they do. If you are a Dittohead or &quot;Hannitized&quot;, just look elsewhere--you won't find the  &quot;Republicans can do no wrong&quot;, factless (not based on fact), liberal-bashing, unsubstantiated and opinionated talk you are looking for.

Whether you agree with his views or not is another story--one which shouldn't have anything to do with writing an accurate review of LLL.  Franken explains in the first five pages that LLL is a satirical attack on a half-dozen or so conservatives and the conservative media in general; he also says it's a funny book, which it is, if you like that sort of thing.  Franken delivers what he promises in LLL, plain and simple.<br />P.S. Franken also goes to great lengths to back up everything he says with sources.

My motivation for buying Al's new book came from hearing him speak and articulate his aim and intent in front of the public at forums around the country. By releasing such a book he has thrown (or rather re-thrown) himself into the mix of best-selling punditry, perhaps the most profitable new book market this side of Michael Crichton or Stephen King novels. The proliferation of these books, coming from either ideological direction, has been, from what I can tell, mostly a misleading, and therefore disingenuous play for the public's mind.<br />Having said that, and having read material from other pundits like Michael Moore, I must say Al makes a very good case (and more fact-based one than Moore) in his book. He takes it upon himself to singularly tear down many arguments from the &quot;right&quot; that various ideological/literary opponents have thrown at the &quot;left&quot; (which amount to pathetically sophomoric and unresearched scream sessions, despite what Ann Coulter's endnotes would have you believe); Charges like treason, slander, anti-Americanism, terrorist funding, terrorist loving, the whole two-faced bit that talking heads on the &quot;right&quot; tout as evidence of &quot;liberal&quot; anti-social behavior.<br />Al, using his satirical wit, makes some rather searing cuts against his literary opponents. His contempt, if not for their person but for their misleading ways, for people like Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity is obvious in both funny and serious ways. This contempt is wielded rather effectively as he deconstructs (many times quite masterfully) their arguments, and goes so far as to point out (for example) statistical misrepresentations made by Hannity in his book Let Freedom Ring. He lets Ms. Coulter have it by simply showing her misguided, sweeping accusations the door, and pointing out the storied lives of many American heros like John Glenn (a Democrat, the kind of person Coulter has nightmares about). He also gets into the nitty-gritty of herliterary ways and explains her tricks (she has also been highly discredited by articles on Spinsanity.com and algerhiss.com).<br />Al also proves that there is no particular bias in media, it just depends on the outlets you go to for news. I would say there's equal amount to serve both angles. But beyond knocking down the easy targets, he gets into his red meat: the Bush administration. He has fun with this one, as there is a lot of material to comment on. He points out how so many of our current leaders trumpet a call to military service, but yet have not served themselves, and in Bush Jr.'s case, actively avoided it (though that really isn't something we didn't know already). Al doesn't really get into the Bush administration's business dealings (Michael Moore has made that his mission), but he does take them to task on what they say or have said, versus what they've done after saying those things. He also calls into question their social and international stances, like dropping out of Kyoto and the ABM treaty (why exactly DID they do this?), and providing copious funds for &quot;big meat&quot;, and the estate tax phase-out.<br />Al and his team do not mount their all-out attack with mountains of stats to prove their points. Perhaps this is because A) Al is first and foremost a satirist, and B) he would probably tell me a book constructed mostly of stats would be about as fun as reading the phone book, and just isn't his style. Rather, he/they make their points either via humor and facts together, or by frankly taking an argument and logically walking the reader through it, exposing its faults or plain-faced misuse against other more valid arguments. <br />Having said that, he documents some of his sources as footnotes (he rails against endnotes ;) ) and names several websites ([...] is one) that were most helpful in his team's research. However I wish he was a little more thorough in citing sources. He cites sources for about 66% (guestimate) of the facts he prints, and I'd be interested in knowing where the rest of his info comes from. He gained my trust as a reader, but personally I'd just like to know to be sure. The fact that he did consult a few conservative-minded people (not just those he makes fun of), and that he had two on his research team, tells me he was at least focused on getting as much factually correct as possible. From the review Spinsanity.com did on his book, it appears TeamFranken mostly got it right. <br />In the end I was satisfied with Franken's book. He listened to all the unproveable, accusatory effusing from the &quot;right&quot;, and finally said &quot;enough&quot;. It got him so angry, it aroused his best satirical instincts, and motivated him to write a book against these lies. I applaud Franken for taking on his mission, and differentiating his book from others by getting the story (mostly) right.	2003-10-29

Franken's comedic approach only made me shake my head in disgust as he poked fun at many prominent right wing politicians and TV personalities. In my opinion Franken's approach is what is wrong with politics recently, preferring to criticize and pick apart policies as well as personalities. If you're a liberal supporter you will probably find this book entertaining but most conservatives won't find it worth their while.	2003-10-28

I wanted a book that I could hand to my conservative friends and religious relatives and say &quot;See, the progressives have valid points in their arguments too&quot; but I couldn't because I knew the message would be lost in the delivery.<br />So, this is a great book to feel good about being left-leaning and excellent as a reference tool, but don't expect to hand it to a conservative and win them over to your way of thinking any more than your reading their fave Ann Coulter book would win you over to the hard right.

The only flaw in this impressive, marvelously researched book is that the delivery could give Franken's critics an excuse to call it a left wing version of Anne Coulter-ish mud-slinging.  Although it isn't, and they would say that anyway, the thing is, there are places where Franken fails to pull some punches (no matter how well deserved the target) that some may not perceive as humor. Who Franken should try to reach are not the extremists but moderates who just haven't bothered to inform themselves about the political situation in this country.  His humor is a great way to do that.  Despite that one small complaint I heartily recommend this book to all except right wing extremists.  Moderates should definitely read this.	2003-10-28

There's not much you can't find out with 15 Harvard kids doing your research. But Harvard or not, schools can't put facts into context. That takes experience and real analysis. Otherwise more facts just become more data to confuse the issue. I expected some real analysis from Al but got the same vitriolic diatribe that I get from Coulter, Hannity or O'Reilly. Complain as he does about them, he's doing the same thing. I was disappointed by that. That being said, it's still a pretty good book. It's flat out funny and cleverly written. Franken brings up some great points that the conservatives need to look at. But tultimately, this is a &quot;preaching to the choir&quot; book.

These are some of the words from supposedly smart top reviewers.<br />How about &quot;on glue&quot;?<br />I guess you call it liberal humor when you want it to be funny when it's really not. One of the reviewers called Bill O'Reilly &quot;muy splotchy&quot;. Man, I guess it's funny if kindergarten humor is your bag. And that's the problem with the book - when you read through it you expect a sticky note to remind you to laugh here. You can see where Franken is attempting to be funny, kind of like the last skit on an SNL airing - it just falls flat. If you want a funny liberal, then go buy some George Carlin instead.<br />Great minds express ideas, and small minds talk about people. The latter is Al Franken, who engages in name-calling, selective research, and pandering (he's now the water boy for the DNC). Think about it. A grown adult actually makes his living by exchanging playground insults with people he doesn't really know. I suppose this is the 60's generation all grown up, if it collectively ever did.<br />I think Paul Wellstone's children should ask Al Franken to expunge any mention of their kind and eloquent father from the book. The association with the smarmy, vile Franken is an insult to the Senator's memory. Franken is a human leech: his trashing of reputations depends on it.	2003-10-27

He's very good at laying out the chronology of a lie:  you can follow how it began, grew &amp; twisted and where it is now.  If I were one of the people he was writing about, I'd be trying to find a place to hide out, especially if I had lied about some document since he has photos of the documents in question demonstrating that what was said was completely untrue (see the voter registration form for Bill O'Reilly).  I appreciate his lack of euphemisms; his willingness to call people on what they say and do; and his wonderful sense of satire.  I am thoroughly enjoying this book and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in politics.	2003-10-27

Well I already knew how sloppy some of the facts were at some conservative radio shows.  They consistantly accused liberals of being anti-american and blame the economy on Clinton.  I will be the first to say that Clinton did well for our economy and remember him closing down wasted federal funds on both the Alameda Navel Base and the Monterey base.  This and other cuts help fuel our economy.  But consistantly this book points out how Fox News and the conservatives call liberals over spenders and the real news to be liberal bias.  <br />But the most interesting part about this book I loved was how Bill Oreily cuts people off on his show, but for once his in the spot light and cannot defend himself as well.  Al Frankin calls him a bully, and in sort that's what Bill is.  Although we need people like Bill to represent the ultra-conservatives.  <br />The other part of this book that made me giggle is the creative fonts Al uses for the Hannity and Colmes show.  Colmes is so much smaller than the rest of the font, he attempts to show you that Colmes is only represented on the Fox News show only to be bashed by the ultra conservatives.  Although if Colmes ran for office, I'd probably vote for him as a centralist.  He's not really a left wing Democrat.<br />All in all, most people agree that conservative radio, Fox News, and conservative print are nothing more than Republican propoganda to help support their cause.  This is no different than the China Daily News, or CCTV.  Maybe some would argue it can be considered state run media for the Republican party.  I enjoyed the facts in this book very much.  From the Polk awards for Inside Edition to the claims that Bill Oreily was a registered independant, when the book shows a copy of Bill's ballot papers showing him checking himself as a Republican. lol...  Man, Bill must be mad about this one. I can't wait til there is a syndicated Al Frankin liberal radio talk show.<br />Oh and for conservatives, you have everything now, California, all three branches of government, tax cuts, and a war.  Please find something positive to say about your party, rather than continueing to blame liberals on your failures.	2003-10-27

Franken knows how to raise issues, deflect criticism and make thought-provoking points.  <br />Unfortunately, I was also left with the impression that the only thing bigger than the Bush Administration's string of failures is Franken's creepy ego.  He writes without a trace of humility or, frequently, humanity.  His relentless efforts to embarrass, harass or intimidate his political opponents serve only one purpose - to demonstrate (as if we needed another demonstration) that as a &quot;star,&quot; Franken is not subject to normal standards of decency.<br />This is, of course, the right's chief indictment of Bill Clinton - that as a man who considered himself a rare talent, smarter and better than all the rest, he was simply above the ordinary laws of human interaction.  So it is disturbing for someone like me, who wants more people to consider Franken's point of view, to see him follow the same deadly alienating path.<br />My advice: enjoy the book, but hope that Franken learns something from his son, who (as described in the Bob Jones University chapter) seems far less self-centered and ego-bloated, and, therefore, more able to connect with the non-stars among us.	2003-10-27

Is there a media bias towards liberals in this country, as so many conservatives claim?  Franken comes up with an answer (I won't give it away).  Franken does an excellent job of dissecting various right wing mouthpieces, such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly, and exposing them for what they truly are.  I cannot urge people strongly enough to read this book.  If you care about the US, I must warn you that this book will probably upset you a bit because the truths Franken uncovers are, well, pretty depressing at times.  Franken has put together a very readable, very informative look at contemporary media and the Bush administration that is not to be missed.	2003-10-27

As Dr.Jones said in the first movie: &quot;In here we deal with fact. If you want truth go to the philosophy department down the hall.&quot; Franken deals with fact. The examples are all similarly structured. To wit: Bill O'Reilly is a liar because he said he was always registered as an independent. Here is the show transcript with his words. Here is a transcript of the phone conversation with Franken where he said he was always registered as an independent. Here is a photocopy of his voter registration plainly marked Republican. It could only be marked by him. Most of the examples are like that. <br />There is a good illustration of the Bush &quot;tax cut&quot; in the form of a conversation with a single mother. <br />I gave it 3 stars because Franken does engage in some name-calling which while understandable and perhaps even justified, seemed beneath the scope of the book. Nevertheless the book is based on well documented fact. <br />I also suggest reading Tucker Carlson's book which a right-wing tome. He uses very little fact and relies on name-calling, inuendo, supposition, and erroneous conclusions based on misrepresenting the facts. Interesting comparison. <br />Also read the 1 star reviews of this and like works to get an idea of the &quot;you're stupid and you suck&quot; sort of argument from the right wing.	2003-10-27

The most amazing chapter of all is the one exposing how the Bush administration ignored the CIA, FBI, Counter-terrorism head Richard Clarke AND the Hart-Rudman report when they tried to warn of an imminent terrorist attack in early to mid 2001.  Franken supplies a long list of details about this.  It's pretty shocking.<br />The Bushies dropped the ball in a major way, and have been trying to put the blame on Clinton ever since.  If fact, as shown by Franken, Clinton had succesfully thwarted several major terrorist attacks, and was taking the Al Queda threat very seriously.  It was Bush and his cronies who decided there was no threat (or even worse, who decided to let it happen for whatever self-serving reasons they might have had).	2003-10-26

It's no wonder that the Democratic Party is promoting the book so heavily.  Like any good satirist, Franken finds no real need to shout his target down, instead preferring to let Bush &amp; Co. hang themselves with their own words.  In almost every chapter of the book, I came across quotations from our political leaders which left me incredulous.  On many occasions, I had to stop to double-check Franken's sources.  And, sure enough, on every occasion Franken has used his evidence fairly.  When Franken reminds us of the current House Majority Leader's explanation for his absence from Vietnam, for instance, the explanation sounded so ridiculous that I thought Franken must be stretching the truth.  And yet I'd encourage anyone to look at the newspaper article to which Franken refers us:  &quot;Representative Tom DeLay explained to the assembled media in New Orleans that he and Dan Quayle were victims of an unusual phenomenon back in the days of the undeclared Southeast Asian war.  So many minority youths had volunteered for the well-paying military positions to escape poverty and the ghetto that there was literally no room for patriotic folks like himself&quot; (*Houston Press* 1/7/01).  The self-serving arrogance and utter lack of social conscience demonstrated in this remark unfortunately tells us much about the people running the country today.  Not only DeLay but many other Republican Party bigwigs have offered similarly ingenious accounts which manage to &quot;reconcile&quot; their nonparticipation with their hawkish mentality.<br />In any political contest conducted through satire, the stronger party understands that fierce and frequent attack, rather than concern for analyzing the other side's data, usually holds the key to victory.  To quote the solecism with which Bill O'Reilly regularly cuts off debate:  &quot;I don't have time to refute the facts you're using.&quot;  What makes Franken's book so remarkable is that he has grasped this principle of satire and *still* handled the &quot;facts&quot; well.  He has pulled off a thoroughly convincing strike on his opponents, without ever straying too far from the solid research that he's built up.  Sure, he relies too heavily on the internet and he hasn't produced many policy recommendations (besides keeping the estate tax), but--let's face it--he doesn't have to dig too deep to find problems with the G.W. Bush administration.  Sure, Franken is far too easy on Clinton; but this book is enough to make even the most jaded reader nostalgic (and not just for the old *Saturday Night Live*).	2003-10-26

It seems you gave every gullible liberal a tool to use against conservatives.  It's a shame that these readers are only aware of SOME lies told by these conservative pundits. As good as you exposed these lies I think books by Hannity, O'Reilly, and Coulter are still worth getting.  How can I buy books by these liars you ask?  Because not everything they're saying is a lie.  As a matter of fact, MOST of everything they're saying is true.  Let me use you as an example...<br />Most of everything you're saying in LIES is true, but there are some things that are false (yet the expose is worth the price of the book).  There's a little something I found out about you, Al.  You lied to every single individual reading your book.  As a matter of fact, you're just as much a liar as the very people you claim to be liars!  Where is this lie?  Let me refresh your memory, Al.  Look up chapter 33 entitled \\"Abstinence Heroes.\\"  I think you know where I'm going with this, don't you?  You wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft requesting an abstinence story.  You claimed in this letter that you \\"received wonderful testimonies from HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, William J. Bennett, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, Cardinal Egan, Senator Rick Santorum, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.\\"  You received these wonderful stories?  Well, if you did, then why is it in chapter 34 you claimed \\"no one had an abstinence story to share with the readers\\"?  Go ahead, Al.  Look it up.  It's your book.  There it is in black and white.  No one received a story even after you said you did.  You said you received a story from Thompson (which was a lie), from Bennett (which was a lie), from Fleischer (which was a lie), from Egan (which was a lie) from Santorum (which was a lie) and from Rice (which was a lie).  Still denying the truth?  Okay.  Why not look up dubya, dubya, dubya, dot, thesmokinggun, dot, com, forwardslash, archive, forwardslash, frankenabs1, dot, html.You'll see it there: in your letter of apology to Ashcroft (which you didn't have the guts to say \\"I lied\\") you said you didn't receive any abstinence story.  <br />But, here's another thing... and, I love this part... you're a thief!  You stole stationery from Shorenstein Center and used a Harvard letterhead, even when you knew you weren't suppose to!  Congratulations, Franken, you're an even bigger moron than Michael Moore!  And, your integrity goes down the toilet as far as I'm concerned.  By the way, did you steal your jokes from TeamFranken?  Did you get some help?  As far as I can tell, outside of your book, you're not really funny.  Although, I must admit you are funny looking.  Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but one things for sure, you're funny in the head.  <br />You did write a good book though, Al (notice the three stars).  So, don't fret.  You're probably wondering if this is the only lie that I can come up with.  Want more?  Okay, how about when you mentioned that COLMES was the \\"only liberal at Fox\\"? Uh, did you forget that Geraldo Rivera has his own show on Fox, too?  And, yes, he is a liberal.  <br />\\"I ADMIT IT, I'M A LIAR!  BUT, I DON'T TELL HALF-TRUTHS LIKE HANNITY!  DOGGONE IT, PEOPLE LIKE ME!\\"  Okay, look up chapter 14.  The chapter about Hannity and COLMES.  You claimed that Hannity had more words to say than COLMES after Bush's State of the Union address.  I want all of your captive-liberal-readers to know that as an avid watcher of Fox News, Hannity and COLMES would interchange.  Meaning, there are shows where COLMES is given more time to speak than Hannity!  Time some shows and you'll see that COLMES would have more time than Hannity and visa versa.  Furthermore, yes, COLMES did say to USA Today that he was \\"quite moderate\\".  But, if you watched Hannity and COLMES as close as you say you do, then you would know that COLMES is apt at saying \\"I'm a proud liberal.\\"  Look up some of the transcripts and you'll know I'm right.  Honestly, Al, are there any social or economic issues that you and COLMES would really disagree with?  <br />Nice try, Al.  But, your half-truths, lies, and thievery won't fade this reader.  Half-truths like the one where you claim conservatives accuse liberals of hating American.  But, you don't mention that the majority of American-bashers are coming from the left!  Who do you think the majority of war activists are?  Leftists, you moron!  And, you accuse Hannity of half-truths!  Speaking of anti-war protestors, you deliberately took Bill O'Reilly's debate with Jeremy Glick totally out of context.  And, what would a discussion of Franken be without Bill O'Reilly?  You mentioned that Glick signed an \\"advertisement opposing the war in Iraq\\", but it wasn't just any advertisement.  It was by Not In Our Name.  Why didn't you mention that, Al?  Maybe it's because NION is known for its leftist anti-American rhetoric.  Apparently NION believes the Gulf War and the removal of Manuel Noriega in Panama can be compared to the terrorist attack on 9/11! As a matter of fact, Glick used the No Spin Zone to spout off more anti-American nonsense.  You should read the transcript again, especially when Glick interrupted and personally insulted O'Reilly when he claimed that O'Reilly evoked 9/11 to rationalize everything from domestic plunder to imperialistic aggression worldwide.  And, you accuse Coulter of citing things \\"but totally misrepresent what it says\\"!  <br />Sorry, Al, after reading your book, I was only convinced that conservatives are just as capable of lying as liberals.  I would cite you as an example.  <br />Good day, <br />coolguy.	2003-10-26

At first glance I thought this book would anger me as Franken ruthlessly attacked those on the Conservative side.  However, as I read this book I could not help but laugh at the ridiculous claims of \\"lies\\" and \\"distortions\\".  Almost every \\"lie\\" was followed by Franken saying \\"while this is technically true\\".  <br />I feel he is mostly correct in his criticism of Bill O'Reilly.  However, the venom he attacks Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity with can only be interpreted as the desperate flailing of a Liberal who has no better arguments than to call names and point out superficial errors and distort them as lies.  <br />Franken's chapters trying to reverse spin the Liberal media into a Conservative media are ridiculous.  Ann Coulter's and Bernie \\"self proclaimed Liberal\\" Goldberg's books have so expertly exposed this and if anyone has watched the news in the last 10 years, it is plainly obvious that there is a Liberal bias in the media.  To argue this is pointless.  <br />Franken's obsession with the Felon-in-Chief that previously occupied the White House is also hilarious.  I loved the claims expressed about Clinton's military.  He talked about how technologic advancements were made to turn \\"dumb\\" bombs into \\"smart\\" bombs.  He does not identify that the reason there were so many \\"dumb\\" bombs is because Reagan made a huge buildup despite Liberals fighting him every step of the way. GPS technology was not available until Clinton's terms.  So here and with the alleged booming economy Clinton created, he was only assisted by growth of technology (i.e. the Internet) that he had nothing to do with.  Besides as Franken asserts it was Al Gore that invented the Internet.<br />I am also surprised at the amount of times Franken lies in this book although I'm certain if confronted about it he will just say that he was using his gift of satire.  Satire is always a clever way to hide the fact that you have noproof of any of your accusations.  <br />There is one whole chapter devoted to deceiving and exposing the vile creatures that exist at a Bible college in the south.  Imagine people holding personal religious beliefs at a private institution and then being ridiculed and criticized by someone who admittedly has no knowledge or concern about why they believe what they believe.  Near the end of this chapter Franken lets loose a wild shot in the dark and accuses Bob Jones of being a Nazi sympathizer and taking some of the spoils that Hitler had stolen from the European Jews.  This is something he provides absolutely no proof of.<br />The last paragraph of this book sums it all up.  <BR>\\"Then O'Reilly and company will have to resort to Plan B: name-calling.  Which, I think, will expose them for what they are.  Stupid ********.\\"<br />He is saying that after Conservatives are exposed as liars they will have to call people names.  As is clear throughout this book and previous books by Franken and Michael Moore that Liberals were exposed as liars long ago and have been name calling ever since.	2003-10-26

That's not all, the reviewer also says that Franken is a \\"loser\\", \\"nutcase\\", and \\"small-minded\\".<br />\\"Lies\\" exposes such double-standards of the Conservatives throughout the book.

US	47672944	R2HGCK6DNQ4TD0	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Not Nearly As Good As It Should Have Been	Al Franken's \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\\" is part of an unofficial liberal trilogy designed to confute the arguments of such right-wing conservative authors as Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.  As with the other two books, Joe Conason's \\"Big Lies\\" and Eric Alterman's  \\"What Liberal Media?,\\" how well you think he does depends to a certain extent on where you fall along the ideological spectrum.<br />Having read and liked the other two books, I have to admit that Franken's book (which for the sake of brevity I'll refer to as \\"LATLLWTT:AFABLATR\\") was far less effective than I thought it would be, and frankly a little disappointing.  While a certain amount of latitude should be given to a political satirist who is essentially a comedy writer rather than a serious writer on politics or public policy, I still have to say that this book is profoundly flawed.<br />There are some instances where Franken is just, as the Brits would say, spot on - his account of how he refuted the arguments of Bernard Goldberg, author of the mendacious best-seller \\"Bias,\\" on live television is both hilarious and convincing.  And the chapter \\"Operation Ignore\\" makes a convincing case that, had Al Gore been occupying the White House in 2001, the events of September 11 might never have happened.  However, there are other parts where he crosses the line between satire and the same kind of mean-spiritedness he declares so reprehensible when indulged in by conservatives.<br />He's also on occasion just plain wrong.  For example, he makes a big deal of Ann Coulter in her recent book \\"Slander\\" saying her book has 780 footnotes when her book has endnotes, and not footnotes.  This is a valid criticism, and one which I made of Coulter myself in my Amazon.com review of \\"Slander.\\"  However, for Franken to go on to say that using endnotes instead of footnotes is in and of itself \\"lying\\" because \\"Endnotes are much harder to reference\\" is just ridiculous.  Franken knows full well that no mainstream publisher would permit an author to publish a book that was written for a wide, non-scholarly audience with 780 footnotes in the text.  It just wouldn't happen.  Blaming Coulter, therefore, for not doing what no mainstream publisher would allow her to do is hypocritical. <br />He is also not immune to the same kind of ad hominem attacks that he professes to deplore.  His treatment of Fox News star blowhard Bill O'Reilly in particular is pretty crass.  His constant reference to O'Reilly's appearance as \\"splotchy\\" and his incessant personal attacks (such as claiming on page 65 that O'Reilly's book is called \\"Living with Herpes\\") make it pretty clear that this is not simply politics but a personal vendetta.  O'Reilly is easy enough to skewer without having to get this nasty about it.  I should also point out that Al Franken is no Brad Pitt himself, so for him to indict O'Reilly for the way he looks is a bit like the pot calling the kettle unattractive. <br />Franken had, as Hillary Clinton might say, \\"a lot of help\\" writing this book from no less than 14 assistants at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.  Now, in and of itself there's nothing wrong with using assistants to do research (Winston Churchill, for example, had almost as much help while drafting his \\"History of the English Speaking Peoples\\"), but the result seems to be a book that's structurally disjointed and way too long. <br />\\"LATLLWTT:AFABLATR\\" would be a much better book if it was at least one-third shorter.  It seems that, having had all this help, Franken felt somehow constrained to use everything that he was given to work with, and the result is a book that is overstuffed with what feels like filler (and outright errors: you would think that he would be able to spell correctly the name of the woman he calls on page 162 a \\"courageous whistleblower\\": it's Coleen Rowley, not Colleen Rowley - to be fair, CNN made the same error).  While we're nit-picking, he also undercounts the number of times Ann Coulter claimed in \\"Slander\\" that \\"Ronald Reagan won the Cold War\\": it was eight times, not seven (I may not have gone to Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, but I can count). <br />There are sections that are painfully unfunny, such as the entire chapter \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One,\\" which reminded me that Al Franken is not just the best-selling author of \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" but also the screenwriter of \\"Stuart Saves His Family,\\" one of the biggest bombs of recent years.  It should have been cut, along with the pointless chapter where Franken goes to the racist Bob Jones University in an attempt to get one of his assistants admitted.  Likewise the chapter \\"The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus,\\" which is both hamfisted and unfunny.<br />Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of things to like about this book.  It's just that other writers have done it better, without all the vitriol and filler.  While I was hoping to recommend this book, I now find myself, with some regret, saying that if you want to read a book that takes on the radical right and their agenda for America, you're much better off reading either Joe Conason or Eric Alterman - especially Alterman.  Perhaps refuting the radical right is too important a task to be left to comedians.	2003-10-25

Franken does not necessarily, in my opinion at least, choose to toot the left's horn here as much as he uncovers the *obvious* BS spewed by the right.<br />There are so many books that expose the right-wing extremists by using bitterness, anger and gossip.  Books by Joe Conason (&quot;Big Lies&quot;) and Eric Alterman (&quot;What Liberal Media?&quot;) are great books but are examples of this, although they are geared more towards debunking what is the pure myth of liberal bias in the *media* rather than the politicians/conservative Washingtonians themselves.  Franken's book is a refreshing change of pace in that it seeks to expose the right through matter-of-fact humor via actual verifiable facts and lacks a great deal, in fact all, of the hostility present in the Alterman and Conason books.  Franken is quite civil towards the right by comparison with other books, yet those *on* the right still take themselves so &quot;seriosuly&quot; (quotes to denote sarcasm) that they choose to sling 4th-grade level insults at him and his book (&quot;I feel sorry for the trees that were chopped down to print this book&quot;?...I mean, really!), which I suppose just proves the whole point that a book like this sets out to make.	2003-10-24

The negative reviews on this page, like this book, are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  Franken is an amazing writer - smart, intelligent and extremely funny.  He hits Conservative's right where they're tender: the pompous, repetitive &quot;If we say it loud enough and long enough, it must be true&quot; bullsh*t that is the Right Ring's mantra.  As dark as today's current socio-political climate is, I can't help but think it's mainly us Liberal's fault - we've been successfully cowed into not speaking up and not fighting back.  I have true hopes that Franken will inspire all the &quot;traitors&quot; of the US to grow a pair.  A must read.  Al, if you read your Amazon reviews (and I know you do), feel free to contact me to thank me for this stellar write-up.  I'd love to be a part of TeamFranken.	2003-10-24

If you're on the left, you already know why you will like this book.<br />If, like me, you consider yourself to be on the right, you should check it out, too.  <br />Why?  Because it reveals that the people on TV and in Washington who sound like they are on your side shouldn't be blindly trusted.  As Franken shows, they are often vicious, power-hungry liars or, at the very least, willfully ignorant.  Many of them aren't primarily interested in the truth, or in the principles on which the country was founded--they are primarily interested in winning the game of Republicans vs. Democrats, at any cost.  <br />And if the thought of reading about that doesn't do anything for you, there's also a lot of bathroom humor.<br />The book seems to lose its focus toward the end, as it strays from its main theme and gets more into typical leftist policy material.  As the Amazon review suggests, chapters about \\"Supply-side Jesus\\" and \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" miss the mark.  <br />On the other hand, late chapters on Franken's personal experiences--from a scam visit to Bob Jones University that goes wrong, to a chat with an icy Barbara Bush on a plane--don't make any political points, but are highly entertaining.<br />All in all, I recommend it, regardless of your political prejudices.	2003-10-24

I am a loyal Fox news fan and enjoy the passionate rhetoric of my favorite commentators.  But I like Fox because it ISN'T fair and balanced, it crooks to the right like me.  Bush-bashing irritates me.  Clinton irritates me more.  But I wanted to see things from the perspective of those leaning to the left, and since Franken took a few pages to direct aim at O'Reilly and Coulter, his book it was.<br />I think this one's a must read for any conservative who finds him/herself riled up by Hannity and O'Reilly or in reading any of Coulter's columns or books.  It's funny, and you don't have to agree with Franken's every opinion to enjoy the ride.  I'm far more cynical about our government and shoddy excuse for a media having read this book.  I'm still watching my favorite commentators, but I'm watching with a more critical eye.<br />I finished this in a weekend, so it's a fast, fun read.  But I'm only giving it three stars because I don't agree with what Franken calls lies (given I'm not sure every &quot;lie&quot; he details is intentional or even all that relevant to the character of the person telling them).  His sources are well cited but his personal attacks on O'Reilly and Coulter seemed like a waste of space.  Who cares how old Coulter is?  I want to know more about the cutthroat spin employed by political parties to win elections and public favor.<br />His self-effacing humor and laid back writing style appealed to me, which is pretty big considering I'm a fan of the screaming,  passionate flag-wavers.   I'm forcing my conservative minded friends to read it too.  The only shot any of us have of getting informed is to read all sides of those issues important to us and make our own decisions.  We clearly can't depend on our political figures or news sources to give us fair and balanced anything.	2003-10-24

I initially thought it would be just more bilge of the type spewed by Limbaugh, Coulter and the like except this time from the far left.  I usually ignore or just laugh at those jokers.  However, I found this book different in that it is very impressively researched. Now,  I'm not in agreement with everything Franken says but I do agree he has done a remarkable and accurate job in pointing out some very troubling examples of extremism on the part of far right politicians and mouthpieces.  (For more examples all you have to do is check out some one star reviews on here.  Yeesh.  What kind of hateful boobs are these people?  Not Republicans I hope.)  What I do hope is that the Republican party wakes up cause I don't want these jokers speaking for me. Oh - and the reviewers who actually read the book are correct - the book is indeed hilarious (in places).  Moderate conservatives - in fact, all conservatives who consider themselves to be decent, honest people - moderate or not - are well advised to read this book and inform themselves about what is taking place in this country's media and political offices in their names.	2003-10-24

Happily, I was wrong in both of these respects.  Franken does an excellent job supporting his conclusions and his reasoning is always sound and quite often insightful.<br />Of course, the book is funny.  I made the mistake of reading it in public places, embarrassing myself frequently when I broke out into peals of laughter. I found it difficult to put the book down.<br />I would allow one monopoly to exist: the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" should belong to Franken.  He has earned it in this work.  Franken doesn't go after conservatism per se (in fact he discusses conservatives he likes: e.g. John McCain).  Rather, his target are conservatives who frequently lie or mislead the public.  And he has the goods on them.  No wonder they continue to deride him.<br />What struck me most about Franken is his genuine care for ordinary people.  This makes the book a total feast.  Within this book, a reader can seamlessly traverse a range of experiences: humor, outrage, empathy, compassion, intellectual satisfaction.  This book is a joy both intellectually and aesthetically.<br />I'll continue to read Franken now.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-10-24

Of course you conservatives will hate him and call him a liar, but you believe Ann Coulter and her dishonest scheme of using endnotes to promote the illusion of integrity; you believe Hannity and Colmes truly represents both sides of a story equally; you believe and reiterate ad nauseum the lies Rush has told, which have been proven false (I could go on...). I don't believe anyone who sees this book as &quot;full of lies&quot; has actually bothered to read it. So, if you are NOT a whack-job conservative and want to see just how FNC etc... really are lying to thier audience, read this book and enlighten yourself. And have a few good laughs in the process as Franken is truly a funny guy, unlike Michael Moore, and certainly unlike Coulter, or any other conservative (although Neal Boortz tries to be, but the Clinton jokes are getting a bit stale).<br />Thank the Lord we have an Al Fraken to somewhat lessen the impact of the outright dishonesty of most of the rest of the political commentators today.	2003-10-24

The liars just keep repeating the lies in the hope they'll gain the patina of truth.  Let me try here to shovel some of the manure out of the way.<br />When Ann Coulter erroneously claims that Evan Thomas is the son of Norman Thomas, one reviewer takes Franken to task for seeming to imply in the book that there is absolutely no relationship between Evan and Norman.  When the reviewer learns through another source that Evan is actually the grandson of Norman, the reviewer indignantly penalizes the book with two stars. Justifiable, I suppose, if Franken was hiding this from the reader.  Except that Franken really does say just that. That Evan is the grandson of Norman.  In the book. It was one of two endnotes he included to prove the point that endnotes are easily missed, inconvenient to reference, not researched further by readers, and generally ignored. Which all sort of proves Franken's point with flying colors, wouldn't you say? Ann Coulter always brags about the hundreds upon hundreds of endnotes she includes in her books. Makes me a teensy bit skeptical of the critical faculties of the mentioned reviewer who claimed to enjoy Coulter's books.<br />Next, there's the \\"lie\\" of the prank letters soliciting high-profile officials to enumerate inspirational personal stories of abstinence. Franken inappropriately used Harvard letterhead for them. He does not try to hide any of this -- it is fully discussed in the book. Personally, I find calculated dishonesty like Bush's \\"By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to those at the bottom end of the spectrum\\" much more insidious and infuriating than a prank. But I'll let you decide which is more important.<br />Also, some have smirkingly referenced Ann Coulter's dot-org site where she attempts to rebut the charges of lies. I encourage everyone to visit the site, ESPECIALLY AFTER you've read Al Franken's book. You will see how incredibly weak or nonexistent her arguments are, although I can see how someone might fallfor her perpetual lie machine if they've never read Franken's book in the first place. Her arguments range from okay-I-have-corrected-that-error-for-future-editions bitterness in which she snidely congratulates liberals for catching a few tiny mistakes in all her hundreds and hundreds of references. You know, liberals like Al Franken who shows that many times these \\"tiny mistakes\\" were the basis of a bigger argument Coulter was making that then collapses like a house of cards.<br />Once you've read Franken's \\"Lies and Lying Liars,\\" you will find the rest of Coulter's points hilariously weak (this woman was actually a lawyer once?!). For example, about a Jesse Jackson TV address in Great Britain she states emphatically that \\"THE NEW YORK TIMES DID NOT REPORT THE SPEECH\\" (all-caps hers). Keep in mind, this is her argument even after Franken proves in his book that the New York Times did indeed report on the speech, including excerpts of it. So how can she make such a claim? The only thing I can figure is she blows a gasket because the NYT did not include one specific quote she had in mind. So you see, what she's doing here is redefining the word \\"report\\" to mean \\"quote in full.\\" It wouldn't surprise me if she would make the distinction that the NYT had reported ON the speech, just not reported the speech. Understand? Very slimy-lawyer-like reasoning which dissolves like wet tissue upon closer inspection.<br />And it goes on and on. Franken shows how a summary of a book in a book review is proof in Coulter's world that the NYT espouses the views of that particular book. Therefore, any quote from any source can be construed as representing the point of view of that newspaper. She claims to find the accusation of spurious logic here confusing. She still claims it's quite proper to say the NYT \\"allows\\" such things to be printed in their pages.<br />Between Ann Coulter's lame rebuttals and Bill O'Reilly's increasingly infantile behavior, conservatives have found that allthey can do is twist and squirm under the cold, hard press of facts presented by Franken in this wonderful book. But beware: the neocons are still out there repeating their lies over and over with increasing volume and hysteria.	2003-10-24

The book's strength lies not just in Franken's razor-sharp wit, but also in the sheer thoroughness of his research, employing a team of 14 Harvard students to rigorously check his facts, and repeatedly expose the right-wing media for the liars they are.<br />If the book has a fault, it's that Franken sometimes wears his partisanship a bit too much on his sleeve. As a card-carrying Democrat, Franken tends to be a tad sycophantic towards Clinton and Gore, and at times he appears to regard the entire Democratic Party as a canon of living saints. I'm sure the Democrats have told the occasional whopper in their time.<br />However, when it comes to exposing right-wing distortion and hypocrisy, Franken is second to none.

It is a 379-page tome that examines what Franken says are the litany of lies that right-wing entertainers, who indirectly receive their marching orders from conservative politicians, lobbyists and corporate owners, disseminate into society.<br />For \\"Lies\\", Franken employed a staff of Harvard University students, also known as \\"Team Franken\\", to dig through right-wing entertainers' comments through their own books, radio and television appearances, newspaper archives and Lexis-Nexis searches - which provide television and radio transcripts. Through these techniques, Franken literally dissects every utterance. Franken shows how rumor or gossip is born in the dominant right-wing media culture.<br />\\"Lies\\" also takes apart the liberal media bias myth by shredding apart Rush Limbaugh and his copycats' claim that conservative media balances out mainstream media. Franken argues that there is a serious right-wing bias in The Wall Street Journal editorial page, The Washington Times, The National Review and of course, The Fox News Network. He believes their wrath is more powerful than most media and is mostly responsible for the current state of the union.	2003-10-23

Franken hilariously cuts down pompous blowhards of the far right in the opening chapters of this book.

There are some gripping and saddening chapters which left me depressed and enraged.  What one comes away with in the end however, is a remarkable analysis of how the game of political and media manipulation is being carried out in this country by those who seek to hide facts and distort truth. This book rings true in all its facts.  What it makes most clear of all is Franken's passion about this country and its true ideals.

It never ceases to amaze me at how poor Americans are at remembering their own history.  The neo-cons will never give an alternative viewpoint a fair chance so a 1 star rating should tell you that the reviewer does NOT want the truth.  That's why they are called ditto-heads - someone else tells them what to think.  The attacks on Clinton - for of all things oral sex - pale when you could just as easily name Nixon, Harding, Grant, or Buchanan as Presidents who repeatedly lied - or were unaware of the truth themselves - about subjects that are so much more important to the goverance of this country, should confirm to the rest of the world that we are a nation that is bereft of an historical clue.  (Apologies to those who know what bereft means)  At a time when we confront international terrorist who have an excellent command of their 4000 year history (Osama referred to avenging a loss to the Spanish in the 700's in the tape released after 9/11), Al Franken challenges Americans not to blindly follow where the Right-wing leads us.  His facts are well researched and do point to lies from the Administration.  I feel like the Marine Colonel portrayed by Jack Nicholson, but a significant number of Americans can't handle the truth.  If that's the case, avoid this book like the plague.  You will stroke out, although that might make the world a safer place, hmm...<BR>I'll admit to being labeled a liberal but I have my DD214 and feel like I'm entitled to my say in our Democracy.  We are wrong.  Where's Osama?  We promised aid to Afghanistan and their opium harvest (remember heroin and the devastation it caused here in the US) is the largest in history.  Saddam's weapons? If these questions piss you off, go back to rock you crawled out from and do us all a favor and pretend to be Eric Rudolph and hide in the woods during next years election.  If it pisses you off that we are forced to ask these questions, then read Al Franken's book.<BR>Like all of Mr. Franken's works, this book is a quick read.  He always seems to pick a subject that lends itself to the type of satire to which his writing style is well suited.  If you enjoyed \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot\\" then you will love the current release.<BR>Mr. Franken's attack is on target and his scholarship (17 Harvard research assistants probably didn't hurt) and with the footnotes and endnotes, it reminded me of many a history textbooks which I have read.  I strongly recommend that the reader read the footnotes; not only are they illuminating about how the right has used endnotes to confuse the public about the right's political agenda but they are funny in and of themselves.  Thank you Al for making all those years of pouring over footnotes rewarding in this book.<BR>Mr. Franken's stated goal - and exhortation to the Non-Right of American politics - of using facts and research to confront the Right's lies holds up until I reached page 254.  Fine, John Walker Lindh plead guilty to treason but it was a deal with Federal prosecutors who wanted to protect US involvement in 1980's Afghanistan (Stinger missiles, drugs for arms with the CIA, Osama was our kind of guy when he was killing Soviets, etc.)  Those Harvard researchers missed that one.  I guess they don't read Mark Twain @ Harvard and how he defined Patriot. Al missed a chance to call Attorney General Ashcroft on that one; would have strengthened his argument against the proposition that Reagan won the Cold War single-handedly.  Strange ... but Lindh was no Benedict Arnold and may yet be rehabilitated.<BR>Then I read page 255.  If you - or your ancestors - are/were Southern, then Mr. Franken has (with help from Harvard, in Boston, MA, right?) rewritten our history.  Ann Coulter must be proud of you, Al.  In your weltanschauung Al, the right of secession (which still exists in most Yankee state Constitutions) meant nothing.  Perhaps, David H. Donald's (Harvard professor emeritus of American history) \\"The Civil War and Reconstruction\\"could lose it's first 242 pages.  Thanks again Al, the left nows gives the simple answers.  And the controversy over the Stars and Bars didn't start in 1866.  We lost, furled our battle flags, adopted the 13th thru 15th Amendments, and at the final order of R.E. Lee, became Americans again.  The flags came out again as a result of Brown v. the Board of Education, so I have little sympathy for those who want to keep them flying.  At one time in my life, I lived in South Jersey and I saw more Stars and Bars on flagpoles than I had ever seen in my home state of Virginia. We know it's over and we lost.  However, to have someone stand behind the banner of Harvard (Veritas, Veritas, Veritas) in Boston - scene of some of the worst race roits due to forced busing - and tell me my ancestors were traitors makes me wonder why the men of the 115th RGT. died on the beaches of Normandy to liberate Mr. Franken's family from German death camps.  I've read of no instances where liberated Jews told Southerners to leave them alone b/c they didn't want to be liberated by traitors.<BR>If Al's position was correct, surely Jefferson Davis (Former US Senator and Sec. of War) would have swung from gallows in the yard of the casement @ Fort Monroe.  One should never judge w/o checking the facts, Al.  Even W. knows better than that and he only went to Yale.<BR>All in all and excellent book that I hardily recommend to my Yankee friends but if I were to give to someone who speaks w/o an accent, I'll tear out page 255.<BR>And to respond to the reviewer who asked to point out where Mr.Franken lied, there it is.  If you need to check sources, even Googol will give sufficient evidence that even Unionist did not consider Confederates traitors.  Veritas.  Veritas.  Veritas.  Guess it depends on your accent.	2003-10-23

This book is a look through a set of hateful, intolerant eyes. Such hypocrisy deserves to remain on the shelf. If you are liberal or just looking to get revenge for losing the elections of 2000, 2002 and recall 2003, then this book is for you.

Bush.  As a veteran under the service of both Bush's, I was appreciative of the respect that had been granted to the military.<br />After reading Al Frankins book and doing some research, I found some of his points well founded and somewhat frightening.  It seems that the media, though often hated, is our fourth branch of government.  This branch has become blantantly skewed to the right; not through the use of argument and reasoning, but through misrepresentation and knowing omissions.  Al is very coarse in his appraisal of his fellow Americans but lacks the false &quot;I'm looking out for you by omitting the truth of Bill OReilly.&quot;  I wish that the book wasn't so full of sarcasm.  This oft times limited its worth and tended to confuse/weaken valid arguments.<br />Nonetheless, I think in the public domain, we could use a news organization which would factually open public charges in the media and examine them in a non-political manner.  Al Frankin's book is a good eye opening start to this process.  It is definitely politically minded but I found few facts that could be denied.	2003-10-22

Kennedy School of Government which says it is \\"dedicated to exploring the intersection of press, politics and public policy in theory and practice\\" - chose the sometime comedian to be one of its Shorenstein Fellows for Spring 2003. An effusive press release said Franken would be \\"working on a book examining whether or not there is a liberal bias in the media, including a look at the media's treatment of George W. Bush and his administration.\\"<br />Now we have the results of Franken's work in his new book \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.\\" In it, Franken attacks lots of people: Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, George W. Bush, and even Alan Colmes, the liberal half of Fox News's Hannity and Colmes whom Franken believes lacks the gumption to stand up to conservative counterpart Sean Hannity.<br />The book has chapter titles like, \\"Ann Coulter: Nutcase,\\" \\"Bill O'Reilly: Lying, Splotchy Bully,\\" and \\"I Attend the White House Correspondents Dinner and Annoy Karl Rove, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, and the Entire Fox News Team.\\" <br />But a question arises: Does Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them measure up to the high academic standards of Harvard's Shorenstein Center?<br />For his new book, Franken put together a team of 14 Harvard research assistants. \\"He recruited them on his own,\\" Jones is quick to point out. \\"They were not paid by us and did not receive any credit.\\"<br />Franken called his group \\"TeamFranken\\" and gave them all special TeamFranken T-shirts. Dressed and ready, they set to work uncovering the lies of the right. <br />And what did they uncover? For one thing, Franken states flatly that George W. Bush, in his younger days, used cocaine.<br />Who knows? Maybe he did. But Franken has no evidence. And he certainly knows that during the 2000 campaign, reporters from major news organizations spent many hours searching - unsuccessfully - for proof of Bush drug use.<BR> <BR>But who cares - Bush is a lying liar, right?<br />And not just about drugs. About more important things, too - like taxes. Franken delves into the old argument about the president's tax cut: Democrats say more money went to upper income taxpayers, while Republicans say lower-income taxpayers received proportionally bigger cuts.<br />Both are correct, but Franken settles it by simply pronouncing the Republicans lying liars. He does so on the basis of the kind of \\"thorough\\" TeamFranken research that so impressed Alex Jones - in this case, apparently reading press handouts from left-leaning advocacy groups.<br />On May 26, 2001 the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a press release which, citing research by the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, said, \\"The bottom 60 percent of the population would receive 14.7 percent of the tax cuts.\\" In Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken writes of the tax cuts, \\"The truth is that the bottom 60 percent got 14.7 percent.\\"<BR> <BR>Did it really take a gaggle of research assistants to come up with that?<br />In a chapter entitled \\"Vast Lagoons of Pig Feces: The Bush Environmental Record,\\" Franken labels George W. Bush \\"the worst environmental president in our nation's history.\\" As an example, he accuses the Bush administration of gutting Bill Clinton's proposed regulations to solve waste problems at giant livestock farms, which are known in the agriculture business as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, or CAFOs.<BR> <BR>But Franken wants to be fair. While Bush's policy has been terrible, he writes, \\"To be totally honest, I wish the Clinton administration had done more to address the pig s**t problem. But at least he [Clinton] was pushing in the right direction. Toward the end of his administration, the EPA issued stringent new CAFO regulations....\\"<br />What Franken does not mention is that the Environmental Protection Agency issued the new CAFO regulations on December 15, 2000. That was certainly toward the end of the Clinton administration, and it was also two days after the presidential election was settled, which meant that everyone finally knew that George W. Bush, and not Al Gore, would be the next president. And that is when the Clinton administration, which had been in office for nearly eight years, decided to get tough on CAFOs. (In addition, the new regulations would not take effect until after a four-month waiting period, at which point Clinton would be long gone.)<br />Did TeamFranken give you the whole story? You decide.<br />At the end of Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken gives his prescription for liberal action. He bases it on an incident he describes earlier in the book, in which he approached Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at a Washington social event and said, \\"Hi, Dr. Wolfowitz. Hey, the Clinton military did a great job in Iraq, didn't it?\\" According to Franken, Wolfowitz paused and then answered, \\"F**k you.\\"<br />In that brief exchange, Franken sees a lesson for liberals. \\"We've got to be willing to throw their lies in their face,\\" he writes. \\"When we say, 'Hey, Dr. Wolfowitz, didn't the Clinton military do a great job in Iraq?' And they say, 'F**k you!' We've gotta come right back and say, 'No. F**k you!' That's how we're going to win this thing. Truth to power, baby.\\"<br />At the same time, Franken writes, \\"We can't fight like they do.\\" Liberals, in stark contrast to conservatives, must be \\"funny and attractive. And passionate. And idealistic.\\"<BR> <BR>Last week, the New York Daily News reported that Franken met with members of the Senate Democratic Caucus, including Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer, and Minority Leader Tom Daschle. It's not known what advice, if any, Franken gave the lawmakers. Perhaps he told them to be funny and attractive and passionate and idealistic. And - especially when dealing with their Republican counterparts - to say \\"F**k you!\\" as much as possible.	2003-10-22

He then lies about winning 2 Peabodys on his tv show and then stands corrected and says it was really was a Polk, which he also did not win.  Al finally brought some truths out about the bullying tactics of the right wing with his hilarious and timely book.  Like the fact that Republicans use push polling, which is basically rumor spreading to character assassinate Democratic candidates.  Or the fact that Bill olielly pulls statistics out of his a** that are completely false.  How about the fiction that Clinton was soft on terrorism?  Franken goes step by step showing Clinton's hardline stance on madmen like Milsovic in Bosnia and asking for more funding to help the CIA and FBI capture terrorists such as Osama.  It seems the good Republican congress was too interested in whether the president was getting a blow to care about terrorism.  Franken goes into detail on how the Bush administration essentially reversed everything Clinton set in motion for anti-terrorism policies by focusing on missile defense systems.  If you give the book a chance I think you will find out some interesting things about the right and especially the so called &quot;fair and balanced&quot; network Fox.

On the other hand, if you're riding the fence on those right-wing extremists, take a chance at becoming a convert by reading this emotionally charged, but factful book.	2003-10-21

Often overlooked is the fact that Clinton tried to pass on to Bush plans to aggressively deal with al Qaeda, an effort headed up by Sandy Berger and Richard Clarke. The Bush administration \\"ignored\\" these efforts and warnings about al Qaeda all the way to 9/11. <br />Franken is very moving in his recounting of the media-created debacle following Paul Wellstone's funeral. Franken's choice of recounting part of Will McLaughlin's eulogy about his father, Mike, who was Wellstone's driver and friend, is most appropriate. More than two pages of the eulogy are given, capturing the emotions of the memorial, to conclude a sad and worrisome recounting of how simple mistakes and political cruelness can be broadcast, via laziness and ineptitude by the media, as a hateful and distorted lie. <br />There are many other funny and important sections to this book. Franken writes a very effective play, where a waitress, starting out as a Bush supporter, is educated by a female tax lawyer as to how her \\"wonderful\\" $350 income tax rebate is outdone by more than $4000 in lost governmental support. A highlight of the book is a hilarious and sobering comic titled \\"Supply Side Jesus;\\" this amazing piece is nearly worth the price of the book all on it's own. <br />Using humor, but also pulling nopunches, Franken has an easy time showing Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity to be the liars they are. He takes care of Bill O'Reilly (which Franken renames Bill O'Lielly) with combined humor and outrage. Franken does not wait too long before applying the book's title to our President, George W. Bush, with \\"Operation Ignore,\\" \\"By Far the Vast Majority of My Tax Cuts...\\" and \\"Vast Lagoons of Pig Feces\\" being particularly to the point. <br />But for all its humor and great moments, this book had me shaking my head in a couple places. Franken decided to write another chapter of his \\"Chickenhawk\\" episode from \\"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.\\" The current chapter has even less relevance, and is more bothersome, than that from the earlier book. What is the point of this comical farce, intent on embarrassing the political right? Does Franken believe that his kind of mixed humor and malice will have any kind of positive effect? <br />Worse yet, Franken recounts a meeting he had with Barbara Bush, where she had the ill fortune to be on the same plane with him. The chapter makes it abundantly clear that Franken can be a real pain when he wants to be. Franken does no more than lower himself to his antagonists' level.<BR> <BR>Which leads to the biggest problem with this book, its \\"tone.\\" Franken spends several chapters on this issue--although talking about the political right, not himself--and does a pretty good job in making his point(s). He missed the point, however, with the ill-humored sections of this book.  To bad, in an otherwise funny and bold attempt to inject more honesty into our political discourse.	2003-10-21

Let's face it: Al Franken is not a George Bush fan and anyone who buys this book looking for a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; analysis of the Bush Administration will be very surprised.  What the reader does get is personal anecdotes, hard facts, and sly wit.  It is a book that tries to dispel the White House &quot;spin&quot; and to present facts (and opinion) that countradict.<br />Is Al Franken opionated?  Absolutely.  Is he over the top, venemous name calling, presenting horrendously false and misleading information (hear that all you Ann Coulter fans!)? Not at all.  What IS fair and balanced about this book is that Franken presents an opposing arguement and backs it up with fair and accurate reporting.  For example, when he describes the encounter with Bill O'Reilly at the now famous book sellers convention, I was expecting a very one-sided description.  I saw this episode as it happened live and I can honestly say that Franken presents the event very fairly and even-handed--he doesn't distort the event to (a) present himself in a better light, or (b) twist the story to make O'Reilly appear worse than he may have appeared.  (Hear that all you Bill O'Reilly fans!)  No, Franken does the opposite, he tells the truth as he sees it and lets the events speak for themselves.<br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  It is enjoyable, serious, and a much needed reminder that George Bush and his administration IS flawed and that their policies should be looked at more carefully by the American people.	2003-10-21

Most liberals suffer from self-loathing and typically invoke their love for &quot;the children&quot; when in fact they are all too willing to use tragedy to suit their agendas, whether it be Al Franken dragging the Wellstone family through his mud and bile, or Al Gore using the near-death of his son to garner sympathy. Liberals like Franken refuse to confront their own dark sides. While they recite their politically-correct sweet talk, their inner selves secretly hope that more soldiers die in Iraq so President Bush doesn't get re-elected, but oh yeah, they &quot;support the troops&quot;.

It has been beaten to death and destroyed through political correctness and the new &quot;I feel your pain&quot; culture that has taken over America. Truth is now whatever anyone wants it to be.

Franken's facts and arguments are sound. Everything in this well-researched book is backed up impeccably. Plus, it is side-splittingly funny in places. This book does what good writing should do: open your mind and make you think. Anyone who wants to get an understanding how the extreme-right-wing media and associated politicians and mouthpieces manipulate facts should read this. This is a highly recommendable and important book. Very entertaining and eye opening. <br />I am absolutely amazed at the hateful commentary in the negative reviews here.  It's obvious that many of those reviews were written by people who have not read the book. The hatred, ignorance and bigotry these people spew merely serves to prove the very point that Franken puts forward - that the extreme right wing has no interest in truthful, rational, unbiased political debate and instead resorts to lies, insults, fear and deceit to advance a narrow minded political agenda.<br />(Oh, in case your wondering: yes - I copied most of this from another reviewer, Mr. Griffiths.

So, what's this business about liberals hating America?  OK, let's see what G.W.'s daddy had to say about losing the presidency to an America-hating-liberal.<br />The following are verbatim quotes from George H.W. Bush concession speeches after the 1992 election (from the G.H.W. Bush Presidential Library web site.)  Nothing in here about a bunch of treasonous America haters taking over.  Lots of remarks about the greatness of the democratic system, the need for new ideas, the common goals of all Americans, putting differences aside to help the new president . . .<br />Remarks in Houston on the Results of the Presidential Election November 3, 1992 <br />Hey, thank you very much. Look, here's the way I see it. Here's the way we see it and the country should see it, that the people have spoken. And we respect the majesty of the democratic system. . . .<BR>I just called Governor Clinton over in Little Rock and offered my congratulations. He did run a strong campaign. I wish him well in the White House. And I want the country to know that our entire administration will work closely with his team to ensure the smooth transition of power. There is important work to be done, and America must always come first. So we will get behind this new President and wish him well. . . .<BR>Now I ask that we stand behind our new President. Regardless of our differences, all Americans share the same purpose: to make this, the world's greatest nation, more safe and more secure and to guarantee every American a shot at the American dream.<br />Radio Address to the Nation on the Results of the Presidential Election November 7, 1992 <br />Way back in 1945, Winston Churchill was defeated at the polls. He said, ``I have been given the Order of the Boot.'' That is the exact same position in which I find myself today. <BR>I admit, this is not the position I would have preferred, but it is a judgment I honor. Having known the sweet taste of popular favor, I can more readily accept the sour tasteof defeat, because it is seasoned for me by my deep devotion to the political system under which this Nation has thrived for two centuries. . . .<BR>I realize that defeat can be divisive. I want the Republican Party to be as constructive on the outside of executive power as it has been for 12 years on the inside. There must be no finger pointing, no playing the blame game. New ideas will flourish, and that is good. . . .<BR>Ours is a nation that has shed the blood of war and cried the tears of depression. We have stretched the limits of human imagination and seen the technologically miraculous become almost mundane. Always, always, our advantage has been our spirit, a constant confidence, a sense that in America the only things not yet accomplished are the things that have not yet been tried. President-elect Clinton needs all Americans to unite behind him so he can move our Nation forward. But more than that, he will need to draw upon this unique American spirit. . . .<BR>There are no magic outside solutions to our problems. The real answers lie within us. We need more than a philosophy of entitlement. We need to all pitch in, lend a hand, and do our part to help forge a brighter future for this country.	2003-10-20

I would like to highlight one reason to read this book and suggest one reason for concern about the book.  <br />The most compelling reason to read this book is to see how easily some of the misleading statements might have been corrected by the authors skewered by Mr. Franken.  Perhaps the most revealing part of this book is that so many statements in the books of others are flat-out untruths.  [Whether they are lies is another issue!]  The authors, their editors, and their adoring fans appear utterly impervious to the principle that oen should only contribute reliable information to the public debate.  What may be worse, many of our fellow citizens seem indifferent to the specious or false information that some of the targets loose on the world.  Mr. Franken's volume, read in concert with similar works by Joe Conason and David Corn, suggests that some misrepresentation or mendacity is not even considered an ethical lapse any more.  Has our culture gotten so used to self-evident falsehoods that we do not even worry about spreading misinformation if it suits our purposes to do so?<br />The only concern that I raise is that Mr. Franken's satiric use of irony and other rhetorical devices provides him an escape route that he would not permit and has not permitted Ms. Coulter, Mr. O'Reilly, or President Bush.  Mr. Franken gets to say &quot;Just joshing&quot; or &quot;Can't you take a joke?&quot; when he veers over the line.  That gives him an easy out that he denies to others.  I hope that fair readers will consider this difference between the satirist and his sanctimonious targets.<br />Both the reason to read the book and the caveat about Mr. Franken's humor may tell readers much more about the sorry state of public discourse than they care to acknowledge!	2003-10-20

Franken's book is a breath of fresh air in an atmosphere poisoned by gastrointestinal emanations from the likes of Anne Coulter.  <br />In her book she claims liberals' loyalty to the United States has to be questioned and implies that those who don't toe a right wing line are committing treason.  I am utterly amazed someone would stoop so low as to come up with crap like that.  The very essence of a democracy is the ability to freely speak out and oppose the government.  It is the most un-treasonous thing you can do in a freedom loving democarcy.  If you aren't allowed to do that - you no longer have freedom and you no longer live in a democracy.<br />Following her line of thinking, I guess we better throw that traitor Wesley Clark into the brig at Guantanamo Bay. And I'll bet Joe Lieberman is actually an al Quaeda operative just waiting to take power so he hand the country over to bin Laden.<br />Let's see . .  In the last presidential election over half the votes were not for the current administration . . so I guess over half the voters committed treason.  That's what . . . 70 . . . 80 million people?  (OK, I don't have the exact figure, but in any case, we'll have to start building a few more cells at Gitmo to hold all those traitors.)<br />And, gee, didn't our military just overthrow the governments in two countries that were one-party autocracies?  I thought that was the sort of stuff we were fighting against.  So, if our military is going around the world overthrowing one-party countries where it actually IS an act of treason to speak against the government . . . what does that make HER for advocating we have that system here?<br />What's wrong with this woman?

My extended family votes Republican with a very few exceptions, and I consider myself a moderate. As Franken points out with impressive documentation, fact-checking, and notation, many of the outspoken members of the right have just gone too crazy for me to risk supporting their party. Be outraged, all of you thousands of decent, intelligent, hard-working conservatives, that these few downright mean, callous, dishonest people are distorting your views, not to mention your party's image.

First off: this is a very sophisticated book, no matter how you feel about the sarcastic and ruthless humor Al Franken displays while making his point. And believe me: he has a point, and it's inescapable. Once you learn the details of all the individual instances of blatant, contemplated and vicious lies that seem to spear-head the conservatives' doctrine, it's not difficult to see why they hate him with such a vengeance.... it's because he's right, he can prove it (and does, in this book), and they know it.<br />There is no way anyone can simply ignore the overwhelming -objective- evidence that Franken produces. Simply by checking the stories, reading the transcripts, and putting things in their proper context. Contrary to most of his `targets', Franken consistently provides all the background information, references and methods used to research this book, so you can actually go out and verify it. Which I did, in several cases.<br />The manner in which Franken dissects O'Reilly's or Coulter's methods, for instance, provides such an accurate reflection of their malicious and immoral minds, that he could have afforded to leave out all of the more personal (subjective) comments. I'm glad he didn't, though, because they helped me stomach the sad reality regarding the state of this democracy that the accounts so vividly depict. If it wasn't for Franken's sharp wit, I might have put the book down in pure disgust. For I am appalled as much as I am baffled by the sheer number and magnitude of lies addressed in this book - and impressed by the intelligent way Franken has managed to expose the lying liars that tell them.	2003-10-20

That is commendable. Someone as concerned about accuracy in political debate as you clearly are should, therefore, welcome a book as well researched as this.  Please read it. Should you encounter any inaccuracies, please point them out.<br />It's important to have people like Franken, Moore and others speak up to point out when the emperor has no clothes.  Thank god we live in a country where you can still do that. Let's keep it that way.  Well done, Mr. Franken.	2003-10-20

Even the conservative right will be hard pressed to refute the findings of TeamFranken.  I stood behind Bush after 9/11 but the war in Iraq has led me to believe the man is an idiot.  I will campaign hard to have him removed from office next year.  My mind was made up long before I read the book, though.	2003-10-19

Looking through these reviews, though, I find &quot;moderates&quot; (whom I'll define as people who have voted both Democrat and Republican) who read and appreciated this book.  I couldn't ask for more.  I give it four stars rather than five, because I'm worried that some readers may take some of his more over-the-top jokes seriously, and because there are a few instances when it's not clear if a quoted conversation is fictional  or true.  Seeing a recent poll, though, that indicated that support for Bush is actually rising slightly again, and that some 53% of Americans think he should be re-elected, makes me pessimistic.  Let's hope this book becomes a must-read bestseller  and actually has some effect on both popular opinion and media coverage.	2003-10-19

Speculation, and assumption, run rampant throughout the pages. Right, left, middle-left, middle-right, and left-right, all become very skewed and confused throughout the whole of the book. Another problem I found, as proved in Arnold Griffith's review above, is the lumping of all people of similarity into a whole, for example, Griffith claims after having read this book that all Christians are hypocrites. If I am not mistaken that is the same kind of illogical reasoning that puts gypsies in prison camps, and people with birth defects in gas chambers. If you want to read something, I would look in the area of positive and helpful, rather than negative and destructive, and this book has plenty of the negativity and destruction.	2003-10-17

Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad.\\" This statement sums up Al Franken's point of view, and his method of expressing it --- it's a simplistic way of describing the difference between liberals and conservatives, but then it has to be. After all, Al Franken is a comedian. To make you laugh, he has to simplify things, keep them quick and entertaining, and poke fun at the right wing's worst moments.<br />He starts off with Ann Coulter's well-documented lies from her books and editorials. He moves on to Rill O'Reilly, showing that O'Reilly lied about his awards and where he grew up. His chapter on Sean Hannity includes the infamous chart that covers up Reagan's tax-and-spend policies. The chapter on the Paul Wellstone Memorial is the least funny, but the most important. Al Franken is really upset about how conservatives twisted the heartfelt sentiments expressed at the memorial.<br />Halfway through the book, he shifts gears. He returns to his \\"Chickenhawk\\" tale from his Rush Limbaugh book, adding new characters. He writes about infiltrating Bob Jones University and attending the White House Correspondents Dinner. He adds in a one-act play and even a comic book about Jesus. The examination of lies slows down in the second half, but the shift to personal stories keeps your interest.<br />If you want a careful analysis of the lies on the right, there are plenty of other books you can read after this one (like Joe Conanson's new book). If you start here, you won't regret it.	2003-10-16

Should you laugh or cry when you read that Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Tom DeLay, Bill Kristol, Rush Limbaugh and many others avoided military service in Vietnam based on flimsy excuses?<br />The chapter on the Bush administration's complete indifference to the al Qaeda threat prior to 9/11 is mind-boggling.  While plans for taking out Bin Laden (developed by the Clinton administration) were shuffled between desks at the White House, President Bush took the longest presidential vacation in 32 years.

I assume that he does not use the same &quot;lying tactics&quot; that he hammers the right for doing.  This book will confirm the feelings of many leftist or even centrist readers, but it will not pursuade people who are sympathetic to the right.  His humor (which is at times insulting to the right) will probably turn off some readers who will focus on his &quot;character attacks&quot; rather than the facts he is presenting.  Finally, there were times in the book when I did not know if he was serious or not, because of the sarcastic way he presented some issues.

That a satirist-cum-political-commentator can speak with such rapier wit and make a convincing case of Bush-clan's ludicrous misgivings is pretty neat in and of itself. I mean, the book even has charts.<br />WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE BOOK:<br />Although I don't relate to some of the people referred to in the book (e.g., Bernie Goldberg, Sean Hannity), at its heart the book is about the core political debate between conservatives and liberals - and the ideological divide between the Bush administration and Democratic opposition which has been sorely deepened by the Iraq issue. This is a universal theme, and anything well written about it, especially when corroborated by accompanying facts, is a delight.<br />Second, Franken showcases some fascinating case studies on the way reporters report and commentators comment without the rigor that should be expected from their profession by definition. Once something is in the electronic cuttings, it's endlessly recycled whether it's true or not; and some of the funniest passages in the book are when Franken takes columnists to task over their dodgier claims.<br />Thirdly, like it or not, many of Bush's follies are ripped to shreds. I did not delude myself into thinking that Bush's is the only administration with these shenanigans, or goof-ups (I mean, burning off a 4.6 US$ surplus in 3 years is not a small feat!) But somehow Dubya lends himself rather well to being the brunt of such humor. It's entertaining, at the very least.<br />AND WHAT'S BAD:<br />Franken's tone is ultra-sardonic, and thus quite soon into the book a bit gratingly shrill. Constant references to attempted humor such as \\"God spoke to me\\" get a bit irksome after 30 pages of refrains. Come to think of it, as intriguing as Franken's factoids and analyses are, if the needless fluff of language was chaffed out this book could easily be 60% its current size. But a minor quibble perhaps.<br />NET NET:<br />If you genuinely thought you'd get some insight into which wing lies more, you're probably not asking the right question.

As Franken points out, the neo-cons say a lot of ridiculous things.  They've be getting away with it for far too long without being taken to task. Although most intelligent people realize the neo-cons are extremists, the problem is that they have gained control of much of the media.  As a result, people who don't pay a lot of attention or question what they hear get the message that the extreme is the \\"mainstream\\".  It's about time someone has said &quot;enough is enough&quot;.  Kudos to Franken, Moore and others for standing up.<br />An example of the far right garbage is when right wing extremists say liberals hate America.  Actually, if anyone hates America it's the far right.  They envision America as a greed driven, intolerant, Christian fundamentalist society in which lies, misinformation and deception are casually and routinely used by the highest government officials.  America is in fact built on the LIBERAL principles of democracy, caring for the poor and oppressed, tolerance for differing points of view, reasoned debate and separation of church and state.  These are the values that the far right hates but they are the core values that made America the leader of the world.  If the far right hates those values (and they do) then obviously, they hate America.<br />This book is hilarious in the way Franken uses his razor sharp wit to slice and dice far right nit-wits.  However, if half of what he states in it is true (and given how well researched the book is, it sure looks like all of it is true) then this is also a very frightening book.  Intolerant, closed minded, extremists are in charge of this country right now.  Frightening.  Everyone in the country with an open mind (which I still believe is most of us) should read this important book.	2003-10-16

This is the best book on politics and the media I've read in a long time.  While plainly exposing many of the rabid ultra-conservatives who are somehow taken seriously in this country, for what they really are - simple hypocritical liars, Al Franken also manages to show once again that he is a very funny guy.<br />Even as someone who actually voted for Reagan and Bush Sr. (can't say I voted for Dubyah), I've been amazed at how much right-wing inspired (or created) rumor and propaganda have been reported in the mainstream media as fact over the past decade or longer.  This book starts to explain why.  &quot;Win at all cost&quot; seems to be the rule of the day.  But, as Franken says, politics is not just a game - it affects the lives of real people.  Many of the passages in this book will make Americans very angry, as they did me, but Franken still finds a way to keep the book firmly based in humor.  Not that the stories aren't serious - they are, and are thoroughly documented with common-sense research and conversations with the actual participants (one would think the press would verify their facts as thoroughly).<br />Speaking as someone who feels bombarded by these right-wing talking heads (I mean really, these people are everywhere - even ESPN/ABC tried to inject Rush Limbaugh's venom into the honest, non-political joy of watching football on TV - some &quot;liberal media!&quot;), Al Franken's is a refreshing voice of sanity, humor and decency.  Between laughing out loud and shaking your head ruefully, you'll find this a very good read.	2003-10-16

The research is solid -- and the professional researchers properly credited.    No wonder that gasbag O'Reilly and Fox wanted to shut Franken up. Despite it's funny title, Lies and Lying liars is a solid book with a load of fact that demonstrates just what a fraud O'Reilly is, along with the rest of the Fox crowd. (So far as fair and balanced goes, all I see on Fox are Opinion gasbags. If there's any news, you have to hunt for it and then it's slanted and frequently unrelated to facts. Consider it just warmup for gasbag to follow).    So far as who's telling the truth, well it was Franken who said Rush Limbaugh was a big, fat idiot. Obviously he was right. But I wondered why he didn't call him a liar in that title. Because nothing Limbaugh said while frothing from the mouth was true. But Franken called him an idiot. That was a nice way of saying Limbaugh  may not have known he was a big fat liar because like so many of the hypocritical right wing extremists, he was popping so many pills it's hard to believe he found time to talk.    There we were, feeling sorry for Limbaugh because he'd gone deaf. If he'd leveled with us, we'd have known his pill popping did it. Feel sorry for poor Rushie! After all, everyone else who's ever had any pain became addicted to 400 pain pills illegally acquired. But when he's recovered, count on Rush to fess up and volunteer for one of those mandatory 10 year stretches people like him advocate for others. Wrong! Bet he'll tell you he shouldn't go to jail. Hey, he's got a lawyer who't get him off the hook. Keep him from paying the price. If black ghetto druggies were smart,  before the man comes about the drugs, they'd check into one of those high end rehab places that will keep people from asking questions?     By the way, whatever we do when it comes time to punish people like O'Lielly, don't put them in solitary with a mirror. Nothing Gasbag Bill likes to do more than listen to himself talk -- unless it's watching himself talk. HIs comments about the Fox lawsuit afterwards were fantastic. The judge effectively said the suit was idiotic and O'Lielly said he had to do it. Proof he's not only a liar, but an idiot. Too bad Hamfist and Milquetoast didn't join.    Get it straight folks. There's satire. Franken does that. With bite and a lot of fact.     Then there are the pompous right wing gasbags like O'Lielly. You can always recognize them because anyone who doesn't agree with them is a traitor, a slanderer  or a baby molester. Or was it that ditzy Ann Coulter who did that? Hard to tell them apart with all the shrill hysteria.    You need to understand something.     Rush and his friends get paid to entertain. They get paid to pander to the worst collection of idiots in the world. That's you if you're a listener. But that doesn't make you a bad person or a traitor. Just an idiot who's too stupid to turn off the talk radio and think for yourself. You're making this collection of life's losers feel important -- and rich enough to score lots of illegal drugs.     Maybe you could read something that challenges the way you've been told to think. You might read something by someone who is actually a thinking conservative, you know, the go slow socially and balance the budget folks,  instead of people whose idea of fun is to fill the streets with people in brown shirts. And maybe a torchlight book banning as a topper.    Resist all those blandishments to look for someone to blame for something that may not even be broken. Because almost certainly what you're hearing is either made up or so badly distorted, it should have been made up.     There was nothing Hitler feared more than the possibility that people might think for themselves. Stalin hated it too, so he sent people to the gulags for not thinking his way.    But hey, you can have it theBush-O'Lielly-Limbaugh way and have plenty of drugs and no punishment, big government spending and no taxes and a war everytime you think you're falling behind in the polls. Do what you're told or we'll bug your office, tap your phone and then think of something else.     Would a presidential candidate do that? And do something cheesy like a late convention in New YOrk so he can bask in the glory of September 11 -- and make people think he's a hero (instead of a draft dodger) just a few weeks before the election?     Sure. The only thing that matters is power. Why worry about the country when you can give your friends big tax breaks and fat no bid contracts in Iraq?     Hey, Halliburton is okay and so's their former CEO, Dick Cheney.	2003-10-15

So I hesitated to read this book because frankly he puts me to sleep when I see old SNL re-runs of him talking into the mirror.<br />But, since I consider myself a pretty open-minded person I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  Plus I wanted to see what all the hype between him and Bill O'Reilly was about.  <br />Franken comes off as really bitter and nitpicky.  To be honest if this is satire, he should really find a new line of work because this one isnt working out for him.  I have yet to read his &quot;Rush is a big fat idiot&quot; Book, but after reading this I really cant see the point.  <br />If you are an angry Liberal then this might be your book.

Franken explains how Ann Coulter lies using footnotes and how she doesn't think much of the intellegance of her readers(can't blame her on that one though). He points out how Bill O'Reilly is a blatant lyer and also a blowhard by pointing out some of his most egregious lies. For example he told one journalist &quot;you don't come any lower than I did on an economic scale&quot; which was later contridicted from an infromed source (his mother)who told the Washington Post that the family vacationed in Florida regularly and that he went to private school.  He brings into light some of the most egregious tactics of Bush's (Karl Rove's) campaign such as calling people in South Carolina during the Repubican primaries and telling them that John McCain has an illigitimate Black child. He also manages to do this while still remaing funny and that really helps to lighten up the tone even though the raw material itself is depresssing. All in all he, and Team Franken, did an eccellente job with this well researched book.	2003-10-15

He starts by lambasting conservative authors and politicians, and he delivers a pretty brutal crush at the end. This is not a book conservatives will like in any sense.<BR>Franken's best chapters detail America's involvement in Aghganistan, starting in the 1980's with the Aghgan resistance to the Soviet invasion. He tells the story of Aghganistan's collapse, albeit breifly, and how that collapse was neglected (Project Neglect). He then tells the story of how Clinton started the war against terrorism without all the grandstanding we see today, and how present day hawks thwarted his every move. He then goes on to detail how exactly the present administration ignored numerous briefings and memoes containing warnings of a terrorist attack for the Fall of 2001 (Operation Ignore). Franken is brutal in his assessment of this and previous administration's failings. <BR>Franken's book is not exhaustively footnoted. He spends most of his time examining other people's footnotes (Coulter's especially) and finds many things lacking, like a corelation of source material to conclusions.

The first time, I found it funny. The second time, I was angry and disgusted by the lies of O'Reilly, Coulter, Hannity and others of the far right. <br />An example: Ann Coulter claims that the New York Times is Liberal biased for the following reasons:-<BR>1) The death of Dale Earnhardt (Nascar hero) was not reported the day after.<BR>2) A controversial speech by Jesse Jackson in the UK was not covered. <BR>She LIED on both counts to further her agenda! The NY Times DID cover both the stories, the first one was even in the front page the very next day!<br />Another example: when asked for his comments on educating Americans about the Koran (the holy book of the Muslims), O'Reilly said, \\"I wouldn't want to read 'Mein Kampf' before World War II.\\" Clearly, O'Reilly compares the Holy Koran to Hitler's Mein Kampf. But when a Muslim calls to challenge him on the subject, O'Reilly replied, \\"I never compared the Koran to Mein Kampf! You've lied, and you're in the No-spin zone!\\" <BR>What a lying Jerk!<br />The sad part is, most of the morons who've given this book a low rating haven't even read the book, as evidenced by statements like:<br />\\"Franken's got his opinion, I've got mine, and don't forget, you can have your own - not the one he tells you to have!\\"<BR>\\"He's just a bomb thrower, and he's not even accurate.\\"<BR>\\"Al Franken...is blinded by his extreme bias and ignorance of facts.\\"<BR>\\"Why is it that a \\"factual\\" attack is under the category \\"satire\\".\\"<br />This is one of the most powerful books exposing the lies of the Conservative psychopaths. Anyone who reads this book will never vote republican again.	2003-10-14

Finally, after months of putting it off, I purchased Mr. Franken's book and finished it in the course of two days.<br />Franken takes on the spin-meisters of the right, and makes you wonder about what the a-holes on the right are so ticked off about. Apparently they are nutjobs (Ann Coulter), idiots (Sean Hannity) or bullies (Bill O'Reilly)...and that's just the hacks. The real menace are those in power, the Nixon-esque Bush Administration, and Franken elequently documents their history of lies to the American people.<br />Franken is obviously partisan to the Left, and some have taken this as a jumping-off point to accuse him of being &quot;just another liberal media pundit with an axe to grind who hates America and leaves the country's back door open for terrorists to get through&quot; and other such nonsense. The fact of the matter is Mr. Franken is an intellegent, passionate, and wonderfully funny man who doesn't like the direction his country is going on thanks to the group-think of Bush-era &quot;compassionate conservativism&quot;.<br />All in all, this is a book for anyone who can't help but wonder how the &quot;liberal&quot; media could possibly be such a threat to America's way of life. When all the BS is over, Franken and his ilk will stand as the true patriots who genuinely love their country. Coulter, Hannity, O'Reilly, and FNC will be exposed as the hypocrites and degenerates they are.	2003-10-13

This book is filled with little truth.  What I do like about the conservatives he bashes is that conservatives will debate issues with people that disagree with them.  Have you ever hear Hannity or Limbaugh cut off a listener because they disagree with them, the answer is NO.  Al Franken resorts to starting fist fights at public places to get press.  Pretty sad for a person in there 50s.  This book is not worth the time.  If you are a true liberal, give us independents some intellectual reasons why you are right on issues, not by using smear campaigns.  That is what the Democratic Party has become a party that can not say a positive thing, its all negative.  Boy that is a great way to live.  There actions over the last three years has made me a die hard Republican  and that comes from a person that voted for Clinton in his last term..

I bought this book as a wavering independent eager to hear about the so called &quot;right-wing conspiracy.&quot;  All that I learned by reading it was that whoever gave Al Franken an occupation where he could rant about his pompous liberal views lacks some very necessary intelligence.  This novel is simply two hundred pages for Franken to complain about people who do much less to belittle our country's justice system than he.	2003-10-13

You just strengthen Franken's arguments about liars, hypocrites, etc. by calling him a liar, hypocrite, etc. without reading what he has to say. <br />And what he had to say surprised me. This was the first book of his I've read, so I expected satire, sarcasm, and laughs, which are delivered. What I didn't expect it was the material to be so well researched and well argued. There are a few times when he jabs/accuses without as much to back it up as I would like (e.g. Mr. X avoided military service, without any source or attribution) but the vast majority of things he says he backs up with attributions to newspapers, interview transcripts, interviews with witnesses, etc. The attributions also come from actually transcripts of inverviews or books wherein the speaker or author digs his or her own hole, without any help from Franken.<br />Though some may call it a satire, there are actually some very serious, sad, and disturbing things that he brings to light.	2003-10-13

A lot of people in these reviews seem to misinterpret this book, and Al Franklin.  Al is not an extreme leftist.  He is not a Chomsky progressive, or a Michael Moore type pit bull activist.  He is a simple Democrat.  More than that, a comedian who uses his weapons of irony, sarcasm, and laughter with tactful proficiency.<br />In &quot;Lies&quot;, Al uses his humor to &quot;take the piss out&quot; of several blowhards.  It is not so much that Al is exposing O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter, etc. as liars; which is, in itself, fascinating.  It is that he exposes these people as hypocrites.  He uses their own arguments against them, proven that these people believe that the standards they set for others don't apply to themselves.<br />Does Al live up to these standards?  No, but that doesn't matter, because he doesn't claim to.  The point of the book is hold up a mirror to those people with pointing fingers, and see what happens when they scrutinized by their own standards.  To address the so called impartiality that these &quot;pundits&quot; claim to possess.  Some reviewers are bothered that Franklin doesn't live up to these standards himself, but that's not the point of the book.  Al never claims to be impartial; he puts his bias right out there for all to see.  What I like most about this book, though, is that he never shows the dripping animosity towards his opposition.  Even more frustrating to them...he laughs in their faces.  The laughter is very contagious.	2003-10-13

Al Franken does a good job of dissecting deliberate misquotations &amp; twisted statistics from various conservative personalities &amp; media sources. And he keeps it all going in a very engaging read.<br />I consider myself a liberal - but I frankly would have liked to see him to stick to the facts w/o the couple of fiction stories he includes in the book. Note that he DOES call them out as fiction &amp; says it clearly (not in the footnotes).<br />As per the facts, there definitely are a TON of them. Very informative read - I will definitely be watching the news &amp; other media more closely for liberal or conservative slants.<br />I would definitely like to see more books in this vein (w/o giving in to occassional flights of fiction) that do a thorough &amp; entertaining job (tough combo!) of taking apart conservative media sources &amp; commentators that are either clearly just lying or are talking w/ absolutely NO EVIDENCE to back up their case.	2003-10-13

Al Franken makes about 1 or 2 good points in his latest book.  Most of it however, is simple theories and conjecture.  Most of all the big lie of how Bush squandered a surplus when there was never a surplus to squander, to begin with.  There are several problems I have with the book.<br />1.  Uses left-winged biased sources such as the &quot;Citizens for Tax Justice.&quot;  In chapter 1, he doesn't quote any sources whatsoever.<br />2.  Doesn't even mention 9/11 and how it weakened our economy.<br />3.  Spends too much time, in the book, attacking irrelevant subjects such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'reilly.  (Talk about more important things than personal vendettas.)<br />4.  Continuously attacks republicans and takes no time to point out the errors and corruption of the democratic party (lop-sided). <br />5.  DOES NOT QUOTE VALID SOURCES!!!!!  (Find a source that doens't have a left-wing agenda).<br />However, he did make points that I felt were valid:<br />1.  Points out corporate corruption (Enron).  <br />2.  The hipocracy of the R party for opposing war in Kosovo but favoring war in Iraq.<br />So, even though I didn't agree with the book, 90% of the time, I still enjoyed it because it was engaging and gave me something to think about.  I recommend the book for any free-thinker.	2003-10-13

Conservatives lie and liberals tell the truth right? It's especially funny when a lying liar named Clinton gets a lying liar named Albright to lie for him? Not only that, get the whole Cabinet of lying liars to lie for you! And of course, there's everybody's favorite book that we know is one big lie. It doesn't even NEED the word LIE on the title. It's called Living History, or is that, er, LYING History. Ya think all those women who accused Clinton were all LYING? YA THINK? How about Schwarzenegger? Were they all LYING? YA THINK? But that's liberal thinking in a nutshell, is it not? If you're a Democrat, you can get away with it. If not, then you're a sexual predator!<br />Let's face it. Liberals live a lie every day. They say they support the troops, but they don't - they secretly want Iraq to become a quagmire and even call it that today! Why do liberals and Democrats always feel the need to say they &quot;support the troops&quot;? That's right, because NOBODY believes them. They're lying. Ever hear a Republican say he supports the troops? NO, because he doesn't have to! And that is exactly the reason why Franken feels he has to bleat about his USO tours - to prove he's a patriot. Yeah, right.	2003-10-13

The first half of the book is engaging and frequently hilarious, but after that it hits a lull in which it has a hard time recovering (although later bits, like &quot;Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One&quot; and &quot;The Lawyer and the Waitress&quot; are effective).  Another bothersome factor is Franken's incessant praise of the Democratic party as a flawless, saintly, do-no-wrong political institution (I'm a registered Green), which becomes tiresome, especially if you've been made privy to some of Clinton and Gore's shady dealings.  Reading this hot on the heels of Michael Moore's &quot;Dude, Where's My Country?&quot; I found the difference between Franken and Moore:  Franken is an entertainer, while Moore is a crusader who happens to be entertaining.  Does &quot;Lies&quot; expose the liberal bias in media for the myth it is?  Yes, and I praise Franken for delivering some much-deserved comeuppance to the bullhorn warhawks dominating the country.  But the book as a whole is too long, at times too vague, and also too centered around Franken's celebrity status as a comedian.  It's a mixed bag.	2003-10-13

To make a whole bunch of money.   All the rest of them (politicians, political analysts, commentators, etc...) same thing!  They are out to make money, and there is NOTHING wrong with that!

When I was younger, the Republican party was the party of fiscal and personal responsibility, the party that offered principled and often well-founded critiques of the Democratic programs and policies.

I honestly never watched Hannity or Coulter very much, but since reading &quot;Lies&quot; have watched and chuckled, while watching their technique of lying, repeating lies, fabricating numbers and shouting down or interupting opposing veiws.  While I hold a fairly conservative view on government _ libertarian actually- and hate the tax &amp; spenders - the hate mongers like Rush the dopehead, Coulter (is she a real blonde?), Hannity et al, and the hypocracy they spew is transparent only to those with open eyes.  While we watch Bush and his henchmen like Rove, Rice, and Cheney go on the &quot;Attack&quot; (their words) for anyone questioning the war, watch as the rats jump ship.  They've already started! Bush has done more damage to this country than any other president in the history of the USA, yet these right-wing freaks keep defending him to the bitter end.

But it's nice to know I'm not alone in my loathing of them. <br />Conservatives have no reason to read this book other than to get themselves mad at liberals.  If that's your thing, go for it.  For liberals, it's pretty self-serving but at least it's fun.	2003-10-13

Al Franken shouldn't be so quick to thank his editors. Every typo puts a small ding in his credibility especially for every time he pontificates on his thoroughness.

Murdoch's Molechs have gotten away their vicious innuendo, distortions, and lies for far too long.  With &quot;Liars,&quot; Mr. Franken, you, with the help of your Harvard-trained research staff, have put the lie to the hoohah of this hydra-headed beast.<br />But really, Al, I wonder, do you really think reason and point-by-point refutation, no matter how accurately executed, will have the slightest effect on the beast and its minions?  It's a shame that it's gotten this bad, but the bought-and-paid-for rhetoric of the hydra has so polarized America, so marginalized, circumscribed, and even criminalized any other point of view that one wonders if there really is any hope for book like yours actually changing anyone's mind.  Yes, it's a shame the so-called liberal media has been missing in action like in the old McCarthy days, and your valiant attempt to throw a monkey wrench into the well-oiled attack machine is laudable, but, really, maybe you should consider doing what so many Americans have already done: relax into the warm bath of slander and take the draught of diminished hope.  <br />Think about it, Al.  Maybe it's time to get your heart into the right place, if you know what I mean. Harden it.  Stop the bleeding.  As we have been told so many times by the Coulter O'Reilly Hannity hydra, there are only two kinds of people in the world: the deserving people who own and run everything because they deserve to, and the undeserving people who are lazy and will never have anything and therefore don't deserve to.  You're successul.  You deserve your fame and money.  You worked hard for it.  Luck had nothing to do with it.  Not your family either.  It was all you, you Rugged Individualist.  So why not gratefully abandon yourself to delicious knee-jerk patriotism and flag reverence of the Fox Network?  Remember that war is the health of the state.  Punch your fist in the air as the Fox tools toadie to the cynical oligarchy which has swallowed up the once-honorable Republican party.  Shout huzzahs to the perfection of the cabalistic policies of George Jr., Cheney, Perle, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Bremer and the corporatist state.  It'll feel great. Really, Al.  And you deserve it, Al.  You're proof that the American system works, aren't you?<br />Whew!  Boy that feels good, that &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; stuff.  The deserving and the undeserving thing.  You can almost see how the Coulter's and Hannity's get carried away with that stuff.  Kind of gets you all puffed up, don't it?  But anyway, seriously, Al, by engaging in this dogfight, this parsing of truth and untruth, you're in mortal danger of becoming a pawn in their game of one-upmanship.  This is a hard game to win.   I'm not saying you shouldn't have done it, or shouldn't continue to, but consider this, too: the best parts of your book are not the sections where you talk how the conservatives have shredded the social safety net and made off with the family silver, or  the parts where you show how Americans have been sold down the trickle-down river, but rather those humane and decent parts of the book where you, for instance, talk about your long and abiding friendship with Paul Wellstone, or talk about the inspiration you find in the American government programs of the New Deal when social justice and equality were embodied in the social safety net, the one that was there for your wife's family when her father was killed in the war.  It is the language of compassion, of community and love that best refutes the devil-take-the-hindmost ethos of  Supply Side Jesus.   (By the way I suspect that's one of the reasons you like Clinton so much -- he knew how to strike the chord of compassion in most decent Americans, whether Democrat or Republican.  This was the gift that drove hisenemies wild with hatred: the common touch conservatives claim to have, but don't).  <br />So what if Hannity doesn't have the number one show on television as he claims?  Or that O'Reilly never won those two Peabody he claims he did? Until someone with similar bandwidth can get up and slap down that hydra, head by head with the human language of real compassion -- and short-circuit the sound-bite, tough-love, focus-group language of compassionate conservatism -- we're going to be forever treated to Murdoch's Manichean world of good and evil: it simply plays so much better on television.  <br />You're right, someone has to put the lie to the liars, and this is a good start, and we appreciate it.  But the other, and, perhaps the more powerful weapon you have at your disposal is your decency and humanity, especially your gift for admitting your own zealousness might sometimes have led you astray.  This weapon is powerful because, as you point out, Americans prefer moral persons to scoundrels and liars.  And Americans very much want to act morally toward their neighbors, their communities, their country and the world.  They are beginning to awaken to the deceptions of these venal and vituperative hacks and their political puppet masters.  The weapons of humility, decency and humanity are powerful too because those who have arrayed themselves against the best interests of America are people who are sorely lacking in these estimable traits.   You and TeamFranken have the good left jab;  use it to keep the bums off-balance while you work on the haymaker.	2003-10-13

My favorite is by &quot;tracy&quot; (below), who use her review to &quot;out&quot; Franken for his phony letter to Ashcroft. She implores you to do a web search to see for yourself. It's in the book, Tracy! If you'd actually read it, you'd know that! And it gets even better... in her other book reviews, she gives 5 stars to &quot;Letters From A Nut&quot; ... a book full of phony letters to unsuspecting companies and organizations and their hilariously sincere responses! She thought that was a real hoot but Franken was somehow out of bounds when he did it. Incredible! Anyway, about the book...<br />This is a gem by one of the few lefty media people to make a career out of confronting and disproving the conspiratorial lies of an increasingly right-wing media, and he'll keep you entertained throughout. The open-minded among you will find plenty to laugh about, though conservative apologists obviously won't see the humor here; they'll only sense the threat to their lying, vindictive smear campaigns that have too often gone unchallenged. Often, Franken only has to make a single phone call to the source of a story to completely debunk it straight from the horse's mouth. I'd like to think that even some Republicans are embarassed enough of the nitwits that represent the extreme (and mean!) wing of their party that they might appreciate this book too.<br />I have to admit that I so despise the shrieking, devisive, juvenile conservative commentators that I got a lot of satisfaction from Franken's exposure of their lies and hypocrisies. However, his sarcastic tone might not be your cup of tea, even if the idea of the book is. There will be those who will wish he took the higher ground, though that wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining and quite frankly it probably wouldn't have reached nearly as many readers. Instead of standing above the cesspool of conservative mean-spiritedness, he sometimes sits at the edge and dangles his feet in. But the point is to be ironic and funny as well as informative. <br />Despite the humor, this is not a lightweight book and its targets are not just silly liberal-bashers but also the bigger lies that have seeped into the public consciousness and swayed public opinion. For example, he takes on the disgusting, self-serving and oft-repeated lie that the blame for the 9/11 terrorist attacks rests solely on the shoulders of Bill Clinton. Whole books have been written on this subject but Franken only needs one chapter to debunk it. Common sense says that since it happened well into Bush's presidency, he must take at least as much, if not more responsibility but it is truly amazing the degree to which some people will filter out anything that doesn't agree with their delusional and dishonest world view.<br />Despite the light tone, Franken insists on high standards of documentation and disclosure throughout the book. How refreshing! A good read for all but the dittoheads. I'm already looking forward to his next book.	2003-10-12

I usually put a lot of confidence into the rating that the respectable readers give to the products on this fine website.  But, I am sad to say that the rating that is given to this book (and related books by Franken and O'Reilly) are inflated, or deflated in O'Reilly's case, and simply misleading.  Too many reviews by \\"reader\\" from Anytown, USA giving the book 5 stars and recommending each other's reviews to make them most helpful.  Per the most helpful review by \\"A reader from Greensboro, NC\\" titled \\"A review from the right, September 5, 2003\\".  533 of 613 people found the following review helpful...  Read it yourself and judge whether you think he's reviewing the book, or reinforcing Franken's, and his own, political views.<br />Numerous other reviews follow the exact same format.  Any dissenting reviews are overwhelmingly voted as non-helpful, while equally gross rhetoric on their side is overwhelmingly voted as helpful.  Odds are this review will fall in the former category, even though I am trying to actually review the book.  Case in point: Jan P. Dennis (see more about me) from Monument, CO USA, a top 1000 reviewer who wrote as honest a review as any of the other reviews and got this: 136 of 1002 people found the following review helpful.  I would rather trust a top 1000 reviewer's words than the 100 anonymous \\"readers\\" who give this book blind praise without actually discussing the elements of the book.<br />On to my review:<br />I find Franken's comedy occasionally funny and his appearances on Conan, Daily Show, etc... to often be hilarious.  But, an accurate source of facts he is not.  A comedian by night, serious political figure by day is not his persona, but he believes himself to be.  Disturbingly, according to their reviews, too many reviewers take his word as accurate portrayals, even though he himself has classified this book as satire, comic reading for a few laughs (NPR FreshAir Interview with Terry Gross 9/3/03) not to mention.  Please do not treat it as more.<br />With a sweeping hand, Franken bashes the right, Christian Coalition, Bush, Coulter, O'Reilly, and everybody else right of Michael Moore.  He lumps all these figures together into one mass and lets loose his furious wit and temper which he is so well known for.  Many times I found myself laughing at his antics, and found his comments not revealing of the subjects of his attacks, but of himself.  Even if his loosely constructed arguments are in any degree true, it is hard to take him seriously due to the nature of his delivery:  \\"God answered, 'YOU KNOW THOSE STUPID BOOKS BY ANN COULTER AND BERNIE GOLDBERG?'\\".<br />If you are in the mood for a good comic read and enjoy Al Franken's diatribes on TV, this might be an interesting read to gain insight into his wacky, wacky world.  Otherwise, ignore this book for it has no political value except to those who's views it reinforces like so many \\"reviewers\\" on this book.<br />Funny, I've forgotten so much of what he was trying to say and I read it only yesterday.  If this is such a classic, how will people remember what he was trying to say 50 years from now...	2003-10-12

Al's view on reality could never be applied to the real world, except for those free citizens who blindly follow such liberal madness to their grave (e.g Adolf Hitler, Lenin, Rousseau etc). Citizen comedian writer, Al Franken, now, believing his own writings to be of some significant social/political value is boorish, not even to be taken as laughable, having moved from \\"Saturday Night Live\\" TV show to \\"Real World Editorials.\\" It is simply comical to think that a comedians imagination can ever be a source of reliable truth. To top that Mr. Franken's attempt to try to convince the thinking population of the world, that those who seek the truth, tell lies, and are merely lying liars - is an ill conceived premise of poor logic. Has Hitler, Lenin, the current French Government, Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, or even Al Franken ever told the world the truth. What a Joke! What liberal Madness!

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a satire is a \\"literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn\\".  Of course, you may not believe that Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney participate in human vices and follies, but leaving that aside, Al Franken is a satirist.  Now we can all relax.<br />Anyone can write a piece full of scorn and ridicule, needless to say.  To be worthwhile, though, it has to include other things.  Like, for instance, relevant facts, accurate analysis, a coherent point of view, even wit.  Let's not get into who's got the monopoly on those elements in the current firefight between the left and right; Franken's got them all to at least some degree, which should be enough for anyone willing to plonk down twenty-five bucks (or fourteen and change on Amazon).  What, though, if anything, makes this a genuinely good book?<br />The answer to that, unsurprisingly, has a lot to do with Al Franken himself.  On the evidence of \\"Lies\\", he's very smart, very angry, and very good at his job, but he's not so arrogant that he thinks he can face down the right on his own.  So, before writing this book, he went and got himself a group of graduate students to do research for him.  His first clever move was naming this bunch \\"Team Franken\\", like it was a professional staff at some cable network with too much money in its digital effects budget.  His second clever move was pointing out that all Team Franken had to do to disprove many right-wing claims was run a few Google searches.<br />With that kind of start, I was all set for Lies to turn into the story of Al and Team Franken running around looking for some challenge, some really subtle and dangerous right-wing lie that would require all of their might to debunk, and not finding it because all the right-wing claims are so blatantly false.  That would have been a terrific book.  This, however, is not that book, and again the reason for it has to do with Franken himself.  Very smart, very angry, very good at his job, he attacks everything about the right that he can't stand, applying dozens of styles and strategies, and winds up with a good collection of essays instead of a great cohesive work.<br />In \\"Lies\\", Al Franken has two main targets  the right-wing \\"news\\" of Matt Drudge, Fox News and others, and the George W. Bush administration  and that right there divides his book in a way he can't quite spackle over.  Then too, he has enough ability to pull him in several directions, such as straight reportage, prose satire, legitimate and political theater, and even comics, which further blurs his focus.  The individual chapters of \\"Lies\\" entertain and instruct quite well, sometimes brilliantly, but the whole thing never gels into anything more than the sum of its considerable parts.<br />This is a pity, because Franken actually has an important point to make.  He's savvy enough to spell it out:  \\"Part of [the right-wing media's] entertainment value comes from their willingness to lie and distortOur added entertainment value will have to come from being funny and attractive.  And passionate.  And idealistic.  But also smart.\\"  That, it seems clear, is the central thrust of his whole effort.  Unfortunately, the statement is on page 353, after a tasty but amorphous goulash of ideas about everything from Bill O'Reilly's emotional fragility to Sean Hannity's statistical fudging to Ann Coulter's rhetorical tricks.  And then to the story of what might have happened if the right-wing hawks Bush, Cheney, Thomas, Limbaugh, Will and others had served in Vietnam, and then something called Supply Side Jesus, who wears a gold-trimmed robe and a pedicure<br />There's certainly nothing wrong with a good collection of satirical political essays, but \\"Lies\\" could have been a great deal more than that.  Basedon that statement about entertainment value, I suspect Franken intended his book to be the opening shot in a left-wing counterattack against the right's demonizations over the past few years.  In fact, it almost is that shot.  He may very well get it just right next time, especially with all the free publicity he's been receiving lately.<br />I note, by the way, that Fox News has recently announced that its withdrawal of the copyright-infringement lawsuit against Franken will allow him to sink back into the obscurity from whence he came.  Now, let's see; Fox News brought suit against Al Franken because he wasn't supposed to use the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" in the title of this book, they splashed it all over every newspaper, political website and blog in the country, they got slapped down hard, and now they're talking like the whole thing was a publicity coup by Al Franken.  He should have a field day with that one.<br />Benshlomo says, Laugh at your enemies; it will drive them crazy.on that statement about entertainment value, I suspect Franken intended his book to be the opening shot in a left-wing counterattack against the right's demonizations over the past few years.

Franken, like many of his Liberal brethren, believes (incorrectly) that freedom of speech includes freedom from criticism.

Like Michael Moore, Franken knows exactly which buttons to push, but this should not be mistaken as good investigative journalism.  Moore defends his use of misleading statistics by hiding behind the shield of comedy.  Franken does the same, attributing the meanspiritedness of his attacks as simply \\"satire\\".

Now all the rest of the right-wing propaganda ministry officials (Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, et al.) will get to know Al even if they don't know him already. The American people desperately need Al's informative humor to come closer to the truth. The drumbeat of conservative talk show hosts and lying Bush administration spokespeople has dumbed down the debate of vital issues making the US electorate less and less informed about vital events in their life, such as jobs exports, long-term economic decline, the economic looting by the upper classes of America, not to mention the Iraq war (remember the \\"sixteen words in the State of the Union\\", <BR>WMD's that are never found, nonexistant uranium shipments from Niger to Iraq, etc.) Now Al Franken educates us quite well with humor.	2003-10-11

I simply deplore american politics, i hate it's high brow attitude towards the rest of the world, whereas it ,itself is filthier than a slum in calcutta. this book was along the same line, but i did not find a lot of factual inaccuracies(that's why i gave it a four star, and the humor was crisp too), unlike Slander or No spin zone which are mindnumbing, boring and full of inaccuracies. the irony of this book is subtle. people with strong affiliation with the extreme right(that includes, Pat robertson, FOx Network and John Ashcroft) will not find this amusing. otherwise this is a rather contemporary sattire though directly marketed to the democrats and liberals, can be very entertaining for centerists too. I enjoyed the book, and though i think this guy Al franken should write something more serious, i like his humor(though i thought the Kharap Juta part was NOT funny, neither ironic, but SAD) i would buy another of his books. and hopefully Ann Coulter will be able to respond to her factual inaccuracies(downright lies sometimes) and come out with a book solid as this one in FACTS.<br />lastly those of you have been bashing this guy or the book, my question is PLEASE FIND ME ANY FACTUAL INACCURACIES!  i would like to see someone here come up with one, and MADE UP FACTS are NOT facts, they are called fiction(note o'riley). so pardon my directness but keep your politics to yourself and try to be fair, or is it too much to ask.<br />  OMI	2003-10-11

You will note that, overall, negative reviews of Lies consist primarily of rants about the so-called liberal media and show no evidence of actually having read the book.  Reviews from those who have actually read it seem to be positive most of the time.  As a comedian, Franken's book is not the same as, say, Conason or Krugman, but it is entertaining (you would expect that from a comedian) and is remarkably effective in exposing the most popular right-wing pundits as, well, blatant liars.  In the interests of full disclosure, I am a liberal, but Franken's case is based upon a careful analysis of said right-wing pundits, and deductions from that analysis using logic (something missing in most right-wing books), with a liberal dose of humor and satire (pun intended).  If you've read the book and disagree, that's your prerogative, but I'd like to see anyone who dislikes Lies explain (based on the book itself, rather than a knee-jerk reaction to the &quot;liberal media&quot;) why not.  It's also a great reference, if one is the sole liberal in a sea of conservatives, for easily accessible and clear refutations to the misinformed positions one often hears.  Lies receives my highest recommendation.	2003-10-11

Instead of wrapping himself in a flag and using emotionally charged rhetoric, Franken uses humor, wit, and above all, fact-based research to convey his points.  <br />Simply put, the right, while claiming the moral high ground, has engaged in more deceit of the American public than the left ever dreamed of.  Franken exposes the myth of the &quot;liberal media&quot;, and shows that Bush has gotten a far easier ride than his Democratic predecessor.  Franken also shows the hypocrisy of an administration gung-ho for war at any cost, yet whose major players avoided military service when it meant personal danger to them.<br />To those who believe patriotism means questioning your government, holding all elected officials accountable for their actions, and not blindly accepting whatever AM radio tells you to think, I highly recommend this book.	2003-10-11

Seriouly, this may be the best footnoted book I've ever read.  If you don't believe me, check out page 16.<br />This book really hits the mark.  I've become a true believer, a fundamentalist Frankenphile.  Not only did I buy the book, I also bought the cassette tapes for the road.  Then, only yesterday, I bought an autographed copy for only $100 via the Democratic Party's website.  It's do to arrive sometime in November and will make a perfect gift for one of my Republican friends.<br />I must warn you, a light comedic work this is not.  It's funny to be sure, often very funny, but mostly it's a hard hitting indictment of our current administration and its media representatives who cynically betrayed the opportunity to unite the country in a non-partisan way in the wake of 9/11.  Instead, as this book demonstrates, the Bush administration used this tragedy to promote their own partisan, power, and profit motives with the help of some key friends in high places in the media.   <br />&quot;Lies&quot; is a high-flighing parody, adopting the haranguing, fanatically rhetorical language and style of squawking heads like Bill &quot;O'Liely,&quot; Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity, who make my body ache for the gentile days of political discourse exemplified by the likes of Bill Buckley and David Frost.  It's not surpising that the humorless targets of this book don't get parody.  All the more fun!<br />Al Franken has balls, funny balls to be sure, but balls nonetheless.  More importantly, he has a brain and a comedic talent to match that really seems to get under the skin of these humorless zealots.  I confess I took an impish delight in reading it.	2003-10-11

If, however, you enjoyed Franken's earlier efforts, than there will be much to enjoy in this one as well.<br />The premise of this book is that the media and pundits on the Right have a tendency to distort and, well, lie in their discussions on ... I guess just about everything.  Franken and a team of Harvard students set out to debunk much of the deception that they have uncovered with cold hard facts.  A lot of the lies they expose are shocking and in many cases pretty funny.  And Franken's description of his interactions with various people (such as Paul Wolfowitz and Colmes - of Hannity and Colmes) are really entertaining, making me chuckle out loud many times.  Of course, an equal number of times I found it all quite frightening and worrisome and depressing, which somewhat tempered the humor quotient!<br />Although I did enjoy the book tremendously, I do not think it is quite as funny as &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot...&quot; and I did have some problems with the fact that Franken does not include more extensive notes (either foot- or end-) while criticizing others for the same practice.  Yes, there are end notes, but the facts that he cites are not specifically referenced, which I found strange, given the time he spends criticizing others for that practice or for manipulating citations.  Still, if you do look through the notes, you do find the sources that he uses and they are informative.<br />Franken's books and similar ones seem destined to infuriate anyone who does not share, at least to some extent, his political perspective.  I do think, however, that there is a lot of important information in the book and that it is presented in an entertaining and humorous fashion - of course, it can't help but be a bit frustrating to see the level to which our current national political discourse has sunk, but that's nota fault of this book.  In short, despite a few caveats, I do think this book is definitely worthwhile - informative, smart, and entertaining albeit somewhat depressing....	2003-10-11

If you don't understand the word, look it up!  Secondly, what Mr. Franken does, and does very well, is point out how many commentators take comments out of context to distort them and turn them into lies that are repeated over and over until they are taken as fact by their viewers. There is a saying that goes &quot;if you say anything enough times, people will believe it&quot;. There are very good examples of this tactic used against not only Al Gore and Bill Clinton, but against Paul Wellstone's own children at a memorial service for their father.  As for Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, and the rest, it is as Al says &quot;like shooting fish in a barrel&quot;.  ANYONE can listen to them for five minutes and see right through them.

Inevitably, there are strengths and weaknesses. Al Frank is a comedian, and it takes some sense of humor to recognize immediately when he is joking. On the other hand, he and his group have made an amazingly good job of checking and presenting facts. I found the chapter on Clinton's fight against terrorism and Bush's neglect of this threat before 9/11 the most powerful of the book. Those reviewers calling him a liar should present a list, or at least examples of his &quot;lies.&quot;<BR>One of the major weaknesses of the book is Al Franken's penchant for vulgarity. Somebody should tell Mr. Franken that while a properly used, occasional profanity can serve a purpose, excessive use only distracts those who do not find coarsening of behavior entertaining.<BR>It is clear from some of the negative comments on these pages that Al Franken has touched a nerve and it is instructive that all they can come up with are invectives without any fact or logic. They show much more about themselves than about Franken and his book. The book is far from perfect if you want a definitive, scholarly exposure of all the major lies and distortions in their order of importance. But if you want something both informative and entertaining, it is hard to beat. Let's hope that Mr. Franken continues to expose the lies and distortions as he sees them.	2003-10-11

A long overdue response to the hateful and dishonest discourse spewed by the far right, but not a response in kind.  Of course, there will be those too fervent in their hatred and fear or just too slow to catch the irony throughout, but this book was not intended for the closed-minded.  Sadly, many conservatives have not yet paid heed to the lessons Franken teaches: that it is better to admit when you're wrong (which Franken himself has done) than to lie to cover your tracks, that you can love America and be willing to challenge aspects of it to improve it, that respect can exist between conservatives and liberals, and that there's no such thing as &quot;unbiased;&quot; there are only admitted bias and lies.  Honest throughout, Al tells stories he's proud of right alongside the ones that make him look admittedly foolish.  This book is so well researched that not only does it stick it to the dishonest politicians and media figures it attacks, but it also leaves no room for the liars to squirm out again.  Despite a lot of whining and protesting, not a single one of the &quot;liars&quot; has given any evidence to contradict anything said in this book, not even Bill &quot;You gotta back it up!&quot; O'Reilly.	2003-10-10

I was initially worried that Franken's book would be humorous but too aimless  to count as serious political satire.  I was wrong.  Franken is not only hilarious and witty, he tackles the most salient topics while poking fun at the absurd rhetoric from the caustic Right.  It's an excellent look at how popular right-wing discourse has sunk so low.  But he doesn't lose sight of explaining why his values -- and those of most Americans -- are of great importance, and easily defensible.  Some of the chapters are instant classics.  <br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone.  Not just to liberals or moderates, but also to conservatives who know how to laugh at themselves, or who are otherwise put-off by the ravings of the self-appointed spokesmen for the Right.

This book has opened up my eyes because before I used to believe what Sean Hannity would say about the &quot;nasty liberals&quot;.

After going over some of the reviews of this book, I realized that ninety per cent of the people who deemed themselves right-wingers who had reviewed this never actually stated anything about the book. Just that Al Franken (or Franklin in some cases) was a 'twit,' a 'moron,' and an 'instigator.' There was nothing presented about the books, and nothing to recommend the decisions these people came upon. I don't blame or accuse or dislike people either of being, or for being, a Republican, I'm not one, but I'm not a Democrat either. I consider myself one of the few people who can actually look at a political situation and settle on what seems right for my interests, and not on what the party line is. However, these one star reviews are somewhat compelling, they state nothing about the book, only that Al Franken is incompetent (which he's not, check some of these facts he presents), or that he just wants a fight. Let him have his fight, because no matter whether you're left or right, neither you nor I should be a part of it. This is how indelible lines get drawn in nations like ours. So let my leave everyone with this, which is actually from the book, for all of you that didn't read, but still reviewed. Republicans love America like a four-year old loves her mommy. Democrats have a grown-up relationship with her. Here's where the similarities between our two situations end, for those of you keeping score. That credo shines through more clearly no where rather than on this very site. All in all, it's a funny book, and it IS truthful, if you don't believe it, look some of this up yourself, you'll find what he did. And it does make you think at least, which is more than I can say for some of the other driving political novels I've read in the past ten years	2003-10-10

Well, Mr. Franken has little solid to prove his points and make his case.  He paints with a wide brush, generalizing about the republican party and about the usual jargon.  Nothing more than propaganda with little to back it up.  No liberal bias in the media?  Please, for God Sakes.  Look at The LA Times and how they handled the California Recall Election and tell me that there's no liberal bias in the media.

He also knows a thing or two about selling books.  But I beg to differ with the author when he claims that &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right,&quot; captures his &quot;hip, sohisticated New York sensibility.&quot;  After all, Franken is a Minnesota boy who only happens to live in New York City.  In my opinion, his writing style is much more like bowling ball journalism.  As a whole, New Yorkers are more cool and do not make a habit of smacking people around with holier than thou rhetoric.  Having said that...Franken lives up to his publisher's billing as &quot;one of our savviest satirists.&quot;<br />To his credit, the author has an outstanding research group which he calls, &quot;TeamFranken&quot; (undergraduates from Harvard University) who painstakingly detail how the Republican -Conservative Right in this nation lies and distorts information.  Moreover, Franken (who is a good American) does a decent job of explaining the important fact that Liberals also love America.  To this end, Franken's book exposes nasty Republican &quot;Push Poll&quot; tactics, documents the mean-spirited conduct of Karl Rove and explains the gross White House stupidity that prompted Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont to alter the political landscape in Congress.  On a positive note, Franken also lovingly pays tribute to deceased Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and his wife Sheila.<br />Still and all, the author is dead wrong when he boldly declares that Bill Clinton is the greatest president of the twenty-first century.  But without a doubt Al Franken is absolutely correct in concluding that the Bush/Chaney/Rumsfeld/Rice White House has embraced a political strategy of manipulating information to defy world opinion.<br />Bert Ruiz	2003-10-10

Jokes aside, Franken's analysis of the current right-wing corporate-news propaganda machine is meticulous.  That's hardly surprising; Franken never ceases to credit his research team at Harvard.<br />His book uses many of the same techniques he used in Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and other observations: he takes transcripts of people who lie telling lies, and then either debunks the lies or shows that very liar contradicting him- or herself.  <br />The highpoint of the book is his tearful account of the use of Paul Wellstone's death by &quot;liars&quot; like Bill O'Reilly and his old nemesis, the Big Fat Idiot himself (who referred to Wellstone as &quot;Senator Wellfare&quot;).  The tone turns a bit caustic, and Franken's grief is as apparent as his outrage.<br />All in all, this is an entertaining, moving and important book that examines not just the content, but the diabolical techniques the right has used to fix elections and make the American public work against its own self interests.	2003-10-10

There is enough repulsion in this book to drive away any thinking person from our cherished left.  It serves only to tear down whatever moral and ethical advantage we held, and will certainly do nothing to convince those in the middle to join our causes - in fact, the vast middle will most likely begin marching right immediately after putting down this book.

I was hoping that Franken would objectively critique and maybe even puncture some holes in the credibility of some of the more opinionated media figures. Unfortunately he swings sloppily and misses almost always: You mean Bill O'Reilly has a temper and an ego? Fine but does he have journalistic integrity? Franken never gets around to that part. <BR>Regarding the controversial pundit Ann Coulter, Franken comes out toothless.  Consider that Ms. Coulter has accused many public figures and politicians of collaborating towards our nation's demise. She provides evidence that there were Soviet spies in the highest levels of government and some of their protectors and enablers in the Democratic party still have great power today. Franken avoids all of this and instead nit-picks on insignificant peripheral issues such as Coulter saying &quot;footnotes&quot; when she should have said &quot;endnotes&quot;.  Is that the most substantive \\"lie\\" that he could find?  (I recommend &quot;The Trouble with Treason&quot;, by David Horowitz - see FrontPagemag.com)<BR>\\"Lies\\", holds to Franken's comedic roots, his greatest strength.  But considering the subject matter he should have been able to bulldoze a few doors down.  Instead he knocks lightly and whines at the other side.	2003-10-10

I wasn't going to write a review until I saw the reviews from David Adkins and &quot;A reader from Knightdale, NC&quot;--both of whom seem to be able to ascribe only one star to a book that they have never read. (Tell us, David, can you also tell us who will win the next superbowl without seeing it?) I know that the polemics of political pundits are often disconcerting to the general public (get out your dictionary, Dave) but to blast a text before reading it is beyond the pale.<br />That aside, the value I see in this book is in what Franken does for us with his wit and his questioning of the current political scene. I actually was turned on to the book by one of my students, a college freshmen. In a age group that rarely explores political thought and that often takes for granted the pablum fed to us by the news media, this young man found that Franken's book pushed him to look a bit closer at and to evaluate more carefully what those in power say to the masses. Critical thinking! A good thing in my book!<br />Should you take Franken's text at face value? No! But then we should never take politics at face value--the informed voter (try this, David) ought to read all sides, all he can on all these issues BEFORE passing judgements. Question everything. That IS what Franken's real message is!<br />Or you could simply enjoy this book as a witty use of satire and sarcasm by a talented comic. (Did you forget, David, that Franken is a humorist?) One of the things that makes America great is the ability we have (or once had, Dave) to laugh at ourselves, to poke fun at our Presidents and at authority in general.

If America is to flourish and thrive as a beacon of democracy we need to rid ourselves of these bonds of partisan politics; we should start thinking for ourselves instead of hoping on the bandwagon and simply agreeing with a society of dualism where your very livlihood is decided by either democrats or republicans.  Aren't we the people as the majority limiting ourselves when we allow only two choices for our Representatives, Senators, and President/Vice President on the ballots?  The media focuses on the two powerhouse parties, which allows democrats and republicans to control the people of America.  They are simply out for their personal gains and use rhetoric, an ancient skill that was taught and used by the Athenian literate in Classical Greece, to persuade others into thinking their argument is correct.  I do not have a bias, I don't necessarily agree with either Al Franken or his arch enemy, Bill O'Reilly.  I believe when you read this book you should use caution and not take his personal biases and views, which are supported by evidence that he found while researching, as THE truth.  Anyone can find evidence to support what they are arguing if they really try.  Use critical thinking and you will be alright.	2003-10-10

He's so desperate and enraged by current developments and the discrediting of his world view that he goes off on practically every single conservative talking head in America, personally-- and the president! And he somehow thinks he's going to &quot;win&quot;?<br />You'd think on some level he'd be aware that he's already on shaky ground beause of 9/11 and the neoconservative response being so effective and positive by any standard. But from that shaky ground he's going to fire every gun he has until the magazines are dry, and not even aim carefully, but just basically go completely nuts shooting in every direction? Very, very stupid. If the liberals wanted to survive to fight another day you would think they'd be retreating and biding their time until conditions are more favorable. But they're not. Not smart at all.<br />You can bet he'll never make another mistake without every major Conservative talking head making him eat it for the rest of his life... but like a typical liberal he thinks he's above making mistakes and that everything that comes out of his own mouth is utterly rational and made out of solid gold.<br />After all, all civilized and pure humans living on the higher plane that is the American Left just KNOW everything they believe is right, it doesn't need to be scrutinized because all GOOD people believe all of it based on faith, and that's why Franken need not address what infininitely more wonderful outcome we'd have had after 9/11 if Al Gore were president, for example, but only the perceived shortcomings of his opposition, arguing essentially the same way as a flat-Earth Creationist-- it's not his job to make a case for why a Democratic president would have been better in these times (ha!!), those annointed in the faith simply know it would be better... making his mocking of Bob Jones University just that much more ironic,but I digress.<br />He's going to pay for the arrogant conceit of thinking his intellectual position is so exalted (maybe he'll start Al Franken University) and rhetorically unassailable that nobody can touch him, not supporters of the President, not all the conservative pundits, nobody.  The fact is he's going to get lampooned mercilessly for the rest of his life.<br />He's going to sell a lot of books this time, it appears liberals are desperate for some good news and high ground.  It's getting uncomfortable arguing so hard that maintaining Western geopolitical concensus is more important than doing the right thing for us and for the Arabs, or pretending it was the wrong thing for the Arabs-- quite exhausting and demoralizing, where's the relief?  Or perhaps because of the increasingly obvious failure of socialism in the West in any form, and the huge humiliation of Bush simply not bothering to pretend that the Emperor of global consensus is wearing any clothes.  I am here to report that they will not find anything in this book.<br />Reading this book makes it clear that the dominant ideology of the post-WWII West is crumbling and crumbling fast.  It's as if Franken is firing off salvos from every gun of a sinking ship at anything he can hit (and not hitting much), before he sinks under the waves.  No other explanation makes much sense considering the total lack of any apparent concern for strategy.  He's never going to be able to make the slightest mistake the rest of his life without someone taping a &quot;kick me&quot; sign on his back.  What soaring arrogance to attempt to take on every prominent representative of the Conservative mindset simultaneously.  Dumb dumb dumb!  Couldn't happen to a more smug, arrogant jerk.

The sole purpose of Mr. Franken's current book is, so far as I am able discern, to sell another book. It is not, to my sense of humor, funny. It lacks the acerbic prose of Harper's Lewis Lapham. Franken's work is analogous to the work of his Israeli bretheren in Palestine: to exchange blows, albeit verbal, with his equally inane opponents. When will the opposition acquiesce? Team Franken, the purported vanguard of Harvard's unpaid \\"intelligentsia\\", is guilty of another reductionistic attempt to pidgeon-hole the opposition with labels i.e., conservative, liberal, republican, democrat...etc. There is only one true measure of societal demarcation: wealth and poverty. Intellectualism knows no party or philosophy. Perhaps Franken could share the book's royalties with Team Franken's researchers; that would be a novel egalitarian stroke. Or perhaps the profits could be donated to a new foundation e.g., The Society for the Prevention of the Propagation of Ignorance (SPPI: there always has to be an acronym). No erudite intellect could be threatened by the likes of Coulter or O'Reilly; these people have merely fallen prey to the delusions of their own paradigm. Too many beer-besotted sports fans rely on others to verbalize their frustrations (hence the best-selling status: see also Jos. Goebbels). But Franken, too, has stooped in this attempt to match wits with half-wits. If you burned the books of Coulter, Limbaugh, Franken et al, I contend that they would give off heat but no light. When will western society stop pandering to the lowest common denominator? Didn't Californians just elect another movie star as governor? Save your money, this one will be on the clearance table before you can say Schwarzenegger.	2003-10-09

Sounds disheartening.  But.... There is a difference between 42,000 results and 42,000 websites.  And what google presents is not individual websites. Most results are duplicates.  Also, what Franken doesn't tell you is that if you go to the same search engine and type in Bush environment and wonderful you'll come up with 1,450,000 results.<br />Seems to me his attack is intellectually dishonest.  When one is attacking the credibility of others, it is critical to be srupulous.  Franken isn't.

It is very funny, particularly as it pokes gaping holes into that demonic pair of Fox pundits, Hannity and O'Reilly, and the rather crazy, and crazed, Coulter.  They may be rather easy targets when it comes to spotting liers but as long as people continue to believe them Al Franken must continue to deflate them.  <br />The author only stumbles a little along the way.  The book could have used a little tighter editing, though, as when it came to a long comedic story about prominent Republican draft-dodgers that could have been excised, and a few of the chapters near the end that could have been expanded.  This makes a fine companion to the slightly superior Bushwhacked by Molly Ivins.  Franken's book is recommended for anyone who truly cares about the future of America.	2003-10-09

Then he deftly pounces on their errors, corrects them and often proves that their original point is greatly mistaken.<br />Franken takes on the bullies and beats them with weel-referenced facts.<br />Oh, by the way, he does a good deal of clever name calling.  Not as much as he did in 'Big Fat idiot', but a lot nevertheless. . .	2003-10-09

The first time, I found it funny. The second time, I was angry and disgusted by the likes of O'Reilly, Coulter, Hannity and others of the far right.<br />An example: Ann Coulter claims that the New York Times is Liberal biased for the following reasons:<BR>1) The death of Dale Earnhardt (Nascar hero) was not reported the day after.<BR>2) A controversial speech by Jesse Jackson in the UK was not covered. <BR>She LIED on both counts to further her agenda! The NY Times DID cover both the stories, the first one was even in the front page the very next day!<br />Another example: when asked for his comments on educating Americans about the Koran (the holy book of the Muslims), O'Reilly said, \\"I wouldn't want to read 'Mein Kampf' before World War II.\\" Clearly, O'Reilly compares the Holy Koran to Hitler's Mein Kampf. But when a Muslim calls to challenge him on the subject, O'Reilly replied, \\"I never compared the Koran to Mein Kampf! You've lied, and you're in the No-spin zone!\\" <BR>What a *&^$^ lying Jerk!<br />The sad part is, most of the morons who've given this book a low rating haven't even read the book, as evidenced by statements like:<br />\\"Franken's got his opinion, I've got mine, and don't forget, you can have your own - not the one he tells you to have!\\"<BR>\\"He's just a bomb thrower, and he's not even accurate.\\"<BR>\\"Al Franken...is blinded by his extreme bias and ignorance of facts.\\"<BR>\\"Why is it that a \\"factual\\" attack is under the category \\"satire\\".\\"<br />This is one of the most powerful books exposing the lies of the Conservative psychopaths.

It also shed some light on how the media has a bias toward conservatism and outright lying -- and it's terrifying when you realize that this entire country is at the mercy of one nasty boob from Texas and the interests that line his pockets.<br />Unlike Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity, Al backs up his information with a series of detailed footnotes and references.

The fictionalized chapter on Vietnam was a publishing mistake, but the rest of the book is a gem, with Franken employing his ironic wit and some easily researchable facts to point out how Republicans can, and often do, spin anything to create a media tempest in a teapot designed to hurt Democrats. This book exposes knee-jerk conservatism in its ugliest forms. The chapter most right-wingers will find difficult to digest is the one on 9/11 that points out in stark detail how Clinton did in fact understand the threat of terrorism and took action on many fronts (including through several anti-terrorism bills, which congressional Republicans invariably rejected), while it took 9/11 before Bush and crew got religion, so to speak. Bill O'Reilly gets the worst of the treatment, with Franken giving copious examples of how O'Reilly holds others accountable for their false statements but finds any investigation into his own offensive. (Also, when confronted with a lie, O'Reilly's instinct seems to be to cover up the lie with another lie. He has already dismissed this book as a pack of lies, which is unintentionally correct since his whoppers figure so prominently in it.) Be warned: If you didn't question the validity of TV news (so-called &quot;24-hour news&quot; in particular) before, you will now. Even the osetnsibly non-partisan Jeff Greenfields and Judy Woodruffs of the world are caught rolling with stories that have little basis in fact and, in some cases, seem to come right out of a Republican Party press release. Democrats were given a pass in this book, it is true, but then I don't recall Rush Limbaugh, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick Conway, Ann Coulter or Peggy Noonan, including Republican malfeasance in any books they ever wrote. What made much of this book possible, however, is the twenty-fourhour news cycle. In the race to &quot;get the story first,&quot; the news media seem to have sacrificed some of their factual integrity for the excitement of sensationalism, none more than Fox News. That's what makes this book such a breath of fresh air.	2003-10-09

He assumes to correct an earlier reviewer from SF with his dead-on, rightful lecturing of another lost soul-and his first \\"point\\" he capitalizes on is the pettiest nitpicking of whether the reviewer from SF addressed whom he was referring to by his actual last name. Lousy!<br />Orniston resisted the indisputable fact that the only reason Russia, France and Germany so difficultly vetoed the last UN resolution was because of economic interests. This amounts to blasphemy on Orniston's part. It's been awfully over-documented that all 3 countries had nothing BUT an economic interest with Iraq.<br />First is the business of UN sanctions against Iraqi oil. France and Russia refused for sanctions to be lifted, on numerous occasions, just as Chirac wanted to continue those sanctions even after war was over. The reason for this is because France and Russia both depended critically on their own oil exports to support their sagging economies. With Iraqi oil on the market, France and Russia would have been excommunicated in being able to sell their own oil, because Iraqi oil's just cheaper. Chirac gloated merrily while Hussein was laying the \\"smackdown\\"-so to speak-on his own people, because all Chirac cared about was protecting his oil exports.<br />It's been arduously documented that Russia had wickedly substantial interests in Iraq, namely a debt of 8 billion that, obviously now, won't be paid off to those commies. Germany and France's gluttony has also been documented, regarding how they built infrastructure for Hussein (bunkers, ammunitions buildings), and likely sold them weapons technologies too.<br />Sadly, these facts are willfully concealed by libs like Orniston, as are truths that honorable countries-like Australia-who was Iraq's 2nd largest trading partner, had no qualms about opposing Hussein for the greater good!<br />The only countries that DIDN'T have economic interests in Iraq but still opposed war were only the lowest of third-world sinkholes-meaning they were mislead by fundamentalist thinking in their respective countries that exploited their shabby economic situations, which are mostly the faults of their policies.<br />Orniston's a democratic apologist-he unaccountably bypasses the free will soldiers have to decide whether to join or not, and blames it on rich men sending kids to die. ASININE. Further, it's Iraqi resistance guerrillas who're killing soldiers-yet annoyance Orniston again wants to brainwash with his conspiracy theories that the Bush Admin. is a plutocracy!<br />Lastly, deceptions WEREN'T used \\"as excuses for war\\". America and its coalition didn't base the liberation of Iraq on Hussein buying uranium from Africa-or that Hussein was within 45-minutes of immediately using WMD! Orniston and all his like-mined, brain-decayed PC zombies need to get their minds out of the gutter, because the Admin.'s maintained from the start they wanted to oust Hussein because of his CAPABILITY to build WMD, terrorism ties and the inference of him possessing WMD because he never let inspectors freely inspect, nor did he account for all his weapons!<br />If this is the spoilt-to-the-core infection that resides in liberals' minds; like Orniston, like Franken, like the DNC-then they're all contemptible!	2003-10-08

I'd never watched Hannity and (poor)colmes, but tuned into the Fox duo on while I continued reading the light-hearted book that takes a heavyweight swing at a bunch of, well, LIARS.  It made the Fox News funnier than Saturday Night Live!  Every time Hannity said &quot;fair and balanced!&quot; I'd get tickled and nearly fell off the couch.  The Fox show should be subtitled &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot;.<br />This book will entertain anyone who hasn't paid serious attention to the frothing right-wing pundits, and bring hilarity to their veracity-challenged antics. <BR> <BR>This is no dry, mean look at the right, although it has some eye-opening tables and charts that expose some big lies we've all heard.  From the &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; teleplay to the letter sent to Administration officials asking them to be role models and share their real-life experiences with sexual abstinence, it's dead-on funny and on the political mark.  Every Republican needs to buy it, read it and loan it to their poor Democrat friends.	2003-10-08

This book backs what it says about the twisted and wrong things that the Bush administration has and hasn't done with factual references that are important for every American blinded by a propaganda laden, and sensationalist Fox News (The ultimate in Jerry Springer type media.), but Bill Clinton wasn't exactly the Prince that he describes him to be, and his personal stories are a tad questionable as well.

Smalley: Don't Quit Your Day Job In The Land Of OBSCURITY	William Orniston has some fatal bile. He assumes to correct an earlier reviewer from SF with his dead-on, rightful lecturing of another lost soul-and his first \\"point\\" he capitalizes on is the pettiest nitpicking of whether the reviewer from SF addressed whom he was referring to by his actual last name. Lousy!<br />Orniston resisted the indisputable fact that the only reason Russia, France and Germany so difficultly vetoed the last UN resolution was because of economic interests. This amounts to blasphemy on Orniston's part. It's been awfully over-documented that all 3 countries had nothing BUT an economic interest with Iraq.<br />First is the business of UN sanctions against Iraqi oil. France and Russia refused for sanctions to be lifted, on numerous occasions, just as Chirac wanted to continue those sanctions even after war was over. The reason for this is because France and Russia both depended critically on their own oil exports to support their sagging economies. With Iraqi oil on the market, France and Russia would have been excommunicated in being able to sell their own oil, because Iraqi oil's just cheaper. Chirac gloated merrily while Hussein was laying the \\"smackdown\\"-so to speak-on his own people, because all Chirac cared about was protecting his oil exports.<br />It's been arduously documented that Russia had wickedly substantial interests in Iraq, namely a debt of 8 billion that, obviously now, won't be paid off to those commies. Germany and France's gluttony has also been documented, regarding how they built infrastructure for Hussein (bunkers, ammunitions buildings), and likely sold them weapons technologies too.<br />Sadly, these facts are willfully concealed by libs like Orniston, as are truths that honorable countries-like Australia-who was Iraq's 2nd largest trading partner, had no qualms about opposing Hussein for the greater good!<br />The only countries that DIDN'T have economic interests in Iraq but still opposed war were only the lowest of third-world sinkholes-meaning they were mislead by fundamentalist thinking in their respective countries that exploited their shabby economic situations, which are mostly the faults of their policies.<br />Orniston's a democratic apologist-he unaccountably bypasses the free will soldiers have to decide whether to join or not, and blames it on rich men sending kids to die. ASININE. Further, it's Iraqi resistance guerrillas who're killing soldiers-yet annoyance Orniston again wants to brainwash with his conspiracy theories that the Bush Admin. is a plutocracy!<br />Lastly, deceptions WEREN'T used \\"as excuses for war\\". America and its coalition didn't base the liberation of Iraq on Hussein buying uranium from Africa-or that Hussein was within 45-minutes of immediately using WMD! Orniston and all his like-mined, brain-decayed PC zombies need to get their minds out of the gutter, because the Admin.'s maintained from the start they wanted to oust Hussein because of his CAPABILITY to build WMD, terrorism ties and the inference of him possessing WMD because he never let inspectors freely inspect, nor did he account for all his weapons!<br />If this is the spoilt-to-the-core infection that resides in liberals' minds; like Orniston, like Franken, like the DNC-then they're all contemptible!	2003-10-08

Calling him &quot;Karl Marx&quot; or a &quot;pinko&quot; or a &quot;commie&quot; is simply fodder for his satire.  And deservedly so since those who read his book cannot fail to notice the many times Franken notes his unabashed participation in the capitalist marketplace.   <br />Would someone please write an ARTICULATE conservative response to this book?<br />In addition to his comedy and his success, Franken also seems to be proud of being a  &quot;truth-teller.&quot;  If you want to hurt the man's feelings--as many of you appear to want to do--see if you can expose him as a liar without lying to us or to yourself.

He reveals for all to see just how much some of our suppossed journalists on the air are willing to lie to advance their cause and the right-wing agenda. It doesn't take an Einstein to see that these people are anything but fair and balanced, but Franken's book sheds new insight into the background and factual misrepresentation of these people. Right on, Al! Keep up the great work. Conservatives who are so quick to give this book 1-star would do well to open their eyes--the Republican Party does not have the best interest of middle-class America in mind. And the character of those on the Right is far below that of Clinton, in my opinion. Al makes a good case for that here. Buy this book, read it.

Come to think of it, you wouldn't expect polemics such as Coulter's &quot;Treason&quot; or Goldberg's &quot;Bias&quot; to have so many mistakes.  So, if the liberal Franken has anything in common with the right-wing Coulter, perhaps it's that they both exceed expectations.  <br />Read this book and then find a more serious overview of Franken's points in books by Eric Alterman or Joe Conason.

Much like any book that gets a lot of media hype, the expectations are set high from the onset.  This is basically a book that slams the Bush government, its hacks, and right-winged media for lying to the American people and the world.  <br />Al, armed with a team of Harvard students ready to do his grunt work while he makes all the cash, attack the credibility of republicans like George W. Bush, Karl Rove, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Rilley, Hannity, Colmes, Gingrich, and the list goes on. <br />The book comes off more whinny and infantile and less so scholarly.  Although Al's crew uncover some interesting facts, I think the book would have packed a stronger punch if it addressed the dirty game of politics as a whole and wasn't partisan.<br />I also found it very unfair how Al Franken pokes fun at Christianity throughout the book.  More specifically, I was disgusted with his prank at Bob Jones University.  This guy has no respect for religion, perhaps not even his own and it was obvious that the book tried to draw subtle parallels between Christianity and the Taliban.<br />My Zionist friend I think a good sequel to this book should be, &quot;Murder, and the Murdering Murderers who Kill - A Fair and Balanced Look at the United States of America and Isreal.&quot;	2003-10-08

Al Frankin's selective amnesia as rendered him a shill for the Marxist in this country who has bought in to the rhetoric that democrats are good and republicans are evil. The true ignorance of the left ideology is that socialism would cure the anti-American sentiment throughout the world. Do you ignoramuses really want government issued health care with a side order of redistribution of land and wealth? Chase that with a flat tax of 80%! Talk about saturated fat! Well, keep feeding idiots like Frankin and voting for dangerous radicals like Hillary and you will see this great nation neutered to a point of us resembling the 3rd world. You see liberals won't stop until yogurt has more culture than America. Speaking of Clinton, can someone explain to me why he simply arrested the 6 terrorists who orchestrated the first World Trade Center bombings? He tried and incarcerated those poor misunderstood freedom fighters (heavy sarcasm) like they just robbed a taco stand. Surprise, Frankin doesn't address this, nor does he chide Clinton for not even visiting New York City after that first bombing. Some nice appreciation to a state he carried to get elected. But I digress. Perhaps if Clinton went after TERRORISM and not merely six TERRORISTS, September 11 may not have occurred.

For over a year now I've been personnaly bombarded by increasingly vicious attacks for following my beliefs, and comming to my own conclusions from people I was thought used to be rational individuals before their minds were poisioned by Fox News.  They, my friends, in a typical attack would come at me with pointed attacks armed with the right wing talking points of the day which I unaware of and hence caught off guard, so would have to sit there and take it shaking my head and offering my only defense, &quot;that just doesn't seem true&quot;.  I'm not one to argue a point in which I have no hard data.  The main attack strategy consisted of the following argument, &quot;There is a liberal bias in the media, and it is time to root it out.&quot;  I consider myself to be a pretty observant guy, and I can spot a phoney for miles.  That being said, I never saw the leftist conspiracy they were talking about. I actually looked.  I watched hours and hours of CNN, read news reports by Reuters, NPR and the like.  I never saw the bias.  That's because it doesn't exist.  If anything, CNN tries to be too independant, and so that makes them boring.  There is however a right wing Media.  You know who they are, Fox News, Talk Radio, etc.  An unscientific scanning of daily news stories during the Iraq war confirmed my suspicions.  Any story which in some remote way could be construed harmful to the political right was spun around by Fox oh so many times that the same story reported on Fox news online when compared to any other main stream news organization's article covering the same story was barely recognizable.  I should note for all you political hardliners out there that I once considered myself a conservative, although now I realize that I don't readily fit into either camp.  You have to however pick sides.  I used to pick conservative becauise I'm a fiscal conservative, and I ignored foreign policy and the environment.  My grass was green.  However, now I'm older and wiser and I realize that when I get lightheaded while playing ultimate frisbee near the dunlop plant in Madison, Al it is because of the chemicals that they are spewing into the air and because my body is screaming for some clean air to fill my lungs while running aroung chasing a frisbee.  However, because of the current right wing media's sickening attacks on everyone and anyone whom so every even questions their ludicrous statements like, &quot;democrats hate america,&quot; and  the ever popular, &quot;demon-crats&quot; I am now going to say I'm a liberal.  I believe all name callers in the politcal right should be taken back to grade school to let the bullies beat them up for making smart ass remarks that they can't back up.  This book debunks famous right wing myths such as &quot;the White house vandalizing myth&quot;, &quot;the Clinton was offered Bin Laden lie&quot;, &quot;the more honorable white house myth&quot;, the pathological lies of Bill o'Reilly, and the disturbing evidence about what the president was warned about but failed to act upon prior to 9/11.  This book is a rare gem in research journalism, but Al does get a little pushey near the end of the book when he engages in ad hominen attacks on people to which he has less evidence with which to attack.	2003-10-07

Franken was funny--about 20 years ago. He hits humorous strides a few times here but this is basically another one of those dopey mad-as-hell-liberal books written for the absolutley humorless and self-righteous political clones that now make up the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. One example of this phenomenon: MoveOn.Org, the lib group that like Franken has been puking all over Bush with its newspaper ads, just took one out in California saying how despicable it would be for Californias to allow a serial grab-ass like Schwarzenegger to become governor of California. This is the same group that took out ads saying how despicable it was to impeach lying, serial grab-ass Bill Clinton over HIS sexual pecadillos, though the accusations against him included sexual assault. These people, like Franken, have high double standards. The hilarious thing to me is how they've become most like the people they most mock--the religious right--in their orthodoxy and willingness to smear anyone who posits a view opposite to theirs. This must be very satisfying to the zealots--but it also explains why Gray Davis is in the dock in California and the White House and Congress belong to the Republicans.	2003-10-07

I already know the reaction this review will get.  If you are liberal, you will love this book.  If you are conservative, you will hate this book.  So, if you are either of these, please don't bother to read any further.  I write this to those of us who are moderate.  To those, I say, this is a book worth reading.<br />Political propaganda has always been vicious and full of lies.  This is nothing new though many of us like to act like this is part of the current fall of the Western world.  For myself, I like to be aware of the lies on both sides.  That is why I enjoy a book like Franken's.  He points out lies both subtle and egregious.  And he does it with a calm and humor that I enjoy.  And he wears his liberal bent right there out on his sleeve.  He's not trying to convince us he's something he's not--like a &quot;compassionate conservative.&quot;<br />Though I follow politics and I always vote in major elections, I have to admit that I'm not passionate about politics.  I've gotten along well enough with both Republican and Democratic administrations of the past 20 or so years.  I also have to admit that I wasn't happy about &quot;Indecision 2000&quot; and the subsequent administration.  Perhaps that's why I'm more interested in Franken's work these days.  Though I've always appreciated his ability to point out the cynicism in people like Limbaugh.<br />When it comes down to it, however, the thing I liked most about this book was the &quot;Team Franken&quot; acknowledgments at the end.  I really like a guy who admits he has help on a project like this and puts their pictures right out there with his.<br />I won't fool myself into thinking I've swayed anyone with this review.  Liberals and conservatives alike will probably revile it and, of course, myself.  (Despite the fact they know nothing about me, really.)  But, if you've made it this far and are still in a calm state of mind, I would suggest you read this book.  It's interesting and good for quite a few laughs.sting and good for quite a few laughs.	2003-10-07

Maybe some of the critical reviewers should make attacks based on facts.  Calling someone a socialist, an extreme left wing elitist, or whatever other conservative drivel (I especially liked the review that managed to spell impotent and Eddie both wrong in the same sentence) doesn't make the case for why the book wasn't worth reading.  Make the case based on facts.  Say (if you dare) that the book misquoted people, took things out of contexts, or misled people-- none of which is true, but at least it would be a real argument.<br />The truth, and the reason why this is the best book I've read in a long time, is that Al Franken's book exposes the right wing media pundits for what they are, lying, political hacks who have no problem misleading the public to advance their agenda.  Unlike many other political books, this one is incredibly enjoyable because, besides being well-researched and factual, it's hillarious.

The first time, it was unbearably funny. The second time, it got my blood boiling at Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity and other Conservative Psychopaths. Franken does a great job of simply contrasting their claims with facts, and their LIES are exposed for all to see. The results are simply hilarious. <br />An example: Coulter claims that the New York Times is a Liberal mouthpiece, since the Times did not report:<BR>1) the death of Dale Earnhardt the day after he died.<BR>2) a controversial speech of Jesse Jackson in the UK.<BR>Guess what? Coulter LIED on both counts! The NY Times DID report both the incidents the day after they happened!<br />Another example: When O'Reilly was once asked about the reading of the Koran by the Americans, he replied, \\"Would you want to read Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' before World War II?\\" Clearly, he compares the Holy Koran to Mein Kampf. Yet, when a guy calls O'Reilly to ask why the unjust comparison was made, O'Reilly says, \\"I never said that! I will not listen to you anymore because you lied. It's the No-spin zone, get it?\\" What a *&*^* jerk! <br />If you want to see the Conservatives for the Lies that they spread like a disease, then read this book.

I was buying some additional copies of this for friends and family and I noticed some of the negative reviews written by conservatives.  Things like: this is hate speech and it's all lies and why doesn't Franken debate?  Obviously they did not read past the cover.  The book does the following and does it exceptionally well:  1.  It picks out people with major right-wing loyalties (Coulter, Hannity, O'Reilly, Bush, etc.)  2.  It takes their words and cites blatent lies and obvious attempts to misrepresent the truth(these cannot be construed as interpretations).   3.  It demonstrates a pattern of lying which is hard to ignore, especially that by the Bush Administration.    4.  It does all of this with solid references taken in context and not the usual out-of-context tricks.        Regardless of your views about Al or liberals, just like his book on Limbaugh, the man tells the truth, makes you think, and makes you laugh.  And, also like his Limbaugh book, people may call him a hater and liar because that is what a four-year old does(right Ann Coulter?), but nobody can ever seem to pick out his &quot;truths&quot; and prove them to be lies, unlike the excessive lies told by the Bushes, Coulters, Hannities, and O'Reilly's of the world -- all of which are EASY to prove are lies.  If I had any doubts when I was reading the book, I saw Bill O'Reilly in BWI airport last week and had just finished the book on the plane.  I thought, what irony!  I looked at him for a few seconds to verify the identity and got a serious dirty look.  So, I can confirm two things.  He is tall, he is a jerk, and he is splotchy.  Enjoy this amazing book.	2003-10-06

He also makes it very clear that such networks as FOX, NBC, and CNN, for example, are filled with commentators who are not their own people, but people paid to tow the party line and say and ask pre-approved remarks and questions to pre-approved people. This is also especially true for supposedly very respectable, big city, newspapers and their editors.<br />It makes one wonder about not just the reliability of the news, but the honesty and integrity of journalism per se.	2003-10-06

He exposes the personalities of the Fox bunch including Colmes who I suspect is paid to be a straight man for Hannity.  Small wonder Fox tried to keep the book off the market.  The one common denominator the right wingers all have is anger.  I heard someone say anger covers fear.  My question is what are they all afraid of?  The truth??  Not only are they all angry, they are mean, nasty, hypocritical, selfish, and self serving.  And they can't take criticism.  They can dish it out but what whiners they are when it comes back.  They can't debate or discuss either.  Try to get Coulter to answer a question and she gives you sarcasm, maybe that's why she is not on t.v. as much and is now giving speeches to boy scout rallies.

Smalley: Don't Quit Your Day Job In The Land Of OBSCURITY	So the pitiful parade of closet liberals masquerading as \\"independents\\" or Republicans, even, is growing larger and longer by the second. Take the last committer of this fraud, David Beall, who further contributes disrepute by claiming he's an expatriate living in the States for 15 years. What really aggravates one is the increasingly, self-righteously derisive number of positive reviewers who are regularly resorting to tarnishing those Americans that support Bush, or are Republican/Conservative, as being less sophisticated than their unwashed, inert, work-shirking, less productive and less affluent European counterparts.<br />David Beall's review does this nicely, as he attempts to cite-get this-for the \\"first time\\" ever in all the reviews, \\"real\\" reasons to support Franken's gibberish and \\"debunk\\" the one-star reviews. Obviously, his comments are exclusively either so discriminatingly suffocating, so to be unstable and extremist in nature, superficially profiling based on general stereotypes of conservatives, ridiculously immaterial \\"points\\" that are harshly secondary to the topic, or DOWNRIGHT, utterly imperfect, unmasking its nature in an unqualified background.<br />Beall spews that the mean Frenchman bests his American counterpart. Beall cites false proofs like Frenchmen \\"having 4-6 weeks vacation a year, enjoy long lunches with excellent wine, can wander through streets with beautiful architecture, have affordable health care, job security and very little poverty\\". To anyone NOT programmed with anti-American propaganda from radical sites like Tom Payne, this is offensively outraging. Here's the amending correction to that reviewer's increasingly moronic and classless tripe.<br />France is currently in RECESSION, has DOUBLE-DIGIT unemployment, its government must now stoop to helped employment and its workers aren't nearly as productive as Americans. These are cold FACTS. Do these actual statistics really correspond to David Beall's agenda of smearing Americans as inferiors, where he claims that the French have \\"job security\\" and \\"very little poverty\\"?? Does anyone really think that having 6 weeks vacation in their incrementally worker protected land is not to blame for their comparably lesser wealth??? Further, since Beall is so loathsomely undereducated about economies, that elusive \\"French job security\\" is EXACTLY why they're recession prone-because laws force businesses in Europe to pay lazy bums even when they're not working and it's much more expensive for European firms to cut workers in recessionary times, all further contributing to a feeble economy with lower living standards!<br />Next, Beall loses control in another prejudicial attack, this time on the American worker. He writes, \\"His American counterpart is lucky to get 2 weeks vacation, works like a dog, eats processed meat from factory farms without proper hygiene and worker safety/benefits, and were there a good chance he lives below the poverty level having had a comparatively poor education, and his future probably means he will lose his manufacturing job in exchange for a job at K-Mart.\\"<br />It's really an outrage for ragingly glaring, closet liberals to try to pull this scheme off. A Frenchman's American counterpart is under no pressure to get only 2 weeks vacation; he does this because of his superior work ethic, wherein America's mentality is more along the lines of working hard to achieve what one wants to attain, instead of the panhandling mentality of France, where that stigma has certainly materialized in LESS jobs and LOWER economic growth. Because of a Frenchman's American counterpart's humbly small vacation time, his American counterpart also enjoys higher living standards in terms of personal wealth, higher pay, stronger spending power, and ultimately contributes to the States' enviably, significantly higher GDP output-both in spending and production, which is the logical side effect of also having much higher production than ol' Europe. All of these factors blatantly improve comforts for people, hence their quality of life.<br />David Beall's jeers at the American worker supposedly living \\"below the poverty level\\" is more confirmation of a closet liberal, owing to how insanely biased that is, and how unschooled that statement is. If the American worker's wealth is directly proportional to his output (Americans are number one), it's discreditable for that failure to even write that. Next, stats say that the States boasts the best graduate school program the world over, so, again, it's blasphemy for someone to curse that an American has \\"comparatively poor education\\". Anyone still not convinced that Beall is the guiltiest closest liberal prowling these messages??<br />The last straw is when this closet liberal assaults a job at K-Mart, obviously in his scornfully elitist mind, equating jobs in the retail sector with being demeaning. A fictional employee at K-Mart, much like Wal-Mart (world's biggest employer of workers, btw), would garner advantageous benefits and probably stock options also. Not like in unhygienic France, and miserably most of Europe, where companies are REQUIRED by European's misguided ignorance to \\"look out for everyone equally\\", where they waste the comparable 21 billion that the American worker is putting back into his economy, with the infamous French welfare-system/garbage of unnaturally LONG unemployment benefits and punishing penalties for companies that need to downscale by firing employees, by intensifying the money employers HAVE to pay to reduce workforce.<br />Conclusion: If this David Beall, closet liberal, is the best example of the liberals here, who so high-handedly and hypocritically challenge the right to \\"provide facts\\", citing \\"facts\\" to \\"back up\\" their \\"points\\", then liberal reasoning is cancerously impaired. Liberals here, and David Beall, need to get an education, a clue, AND a life. Scariest of all, NOT necessarily in that order.	2003-10-05

I finished this book the day after I bought it, simply because it is the funniest thing I have ever read. This book is sure to make liberals laugh hysterically and conversatives grind their teeth, but that is not to say that the book is completly one-sided. Franken defends several conservatives, such as John McCain, berating Bush's people for playing dirty during the South Carolina Primary. The main people that Franken goes after are extreme rightists who, as he proves, lie to achieve their various ends. There really isn't a liberal bias in the media, not as long as Fox News exists.<br />Lies is not intended as a manifesto on why &quot;we are right&quot; and &quot;they are wrong,&quot; it simply tries to point out the absurdity of certain accusations against the Left from the Right.<br />Oh, and the Harvard thing? There's a difference: Al Franken was 'lying' as a joke and did not intented to be taken seriously. People like Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly are lying, and are doing it in all sincerity. <br />However, this book is not all fun and games. At several points, Franken lets all pretense and humor fall and presents sobering facts that would leave anyone human feeling numb and disgusted, such as where all of Bush's Tax Cut money really went. (He lied to the public about that too, by the way. Read about it.)<br />In short: Read this book. You'll be laughing and crying all the way through. :)	2003-10-05

Take the last committer of this fraud, David Beall, who further contributes disrepute by claiming he's an expatriate living in the States for 15 years. What really aggravates one is the increasingly, self-righteously derisive number of positive reviewers who are regularly resorting to tarnishing those Americans that support Bush, or are Republican/Conservative, as being less sophisticated than their unwashed, inert, work-shirking, less productive and less affluent European counterparts.<br />David Beall's review does this nicely, as he attempts to cite-get this-for the \\"first time\\" ever in all the reviews, \\"real\\" reasons to support Franken's gibberish and \\"debunk\\" the one-star reviews. Obviously, his comments are exclusively either so discriminatingly suffocating, so to be unstable and extremist in nature, superficially profiling based on general stereotypes of conservatives, ridiculously immaterial \\"points\\" that are harshly secondary to the topic, or DOWNRIGHT, utterly imperfect, unmasking its nature in an unqualified background.<br />Beall spews that the mean Frenchman bests his American counterpart. Beall cites false proofs like Frenchmen \\"having 4-6 weeks vacation a year, enjoy long lunches with excellent wine, can wander through streets with beautiful architecture, have affordable health care, job security and very little poverty\\". To anyone NOT programmed with anti-American propaganda from radical sites like Tom Payne, this is offensively outraging.

In fact, we could use a few of them.  <br />Comedian, Harvard Fellow and Liberal commentator Al Franken is a man who has the courage, wit, and smarts to not just stand up to the Conservative Right, but to do so intelligently, and with a sense of humor (something the right is wholly devoid of).  In this book, he blows the lid off of the selective editing, obfuscation, and downright untruth often used by the Right Wing when it comes to advancing their political and social agenda.  He uses factual reasoning and extensive bibliographical resources to illustrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Right...hardly ever is.  <br />He reserves particular vitriol for Conservative media figureheads like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Bernie Goldberg and Sean Hannity, punching holes in their inflated facades, and letting the air out of their needlessly overblown egoes.  But it's not as though the Bush administration gets off light, either.  He takes the Bush team to task on the economy, environment, foreign policy, and education.  His chapter on pre-9/11 intelligence failings is seriously eye-opening, and worth the price of admission alone; as are his views on the Wellstone Memorial (or lack thereof), Fox News, and &quot;liberal bias in the media.&quot;<br />Franken also dismisses the &quot;with us or against us&quot; domestic policy of the Bush administration, wherein voices of dissent are universally (and incorrectly) colored as being borne of anti-American sentiment, by drawing an apt analogy:  Liberals don't hate America, Liberals love America just as much as conservatives do.  It's just that Conservatives love America like a four-year-old loves her mommy: Totally, completely, and without question.  Mommy is Wonder Woman.  She is perfect, beautiful, and can do no wrong.  Liberals, however, love America like a spouse: Affectionately, but with maturity; and with an understanding that he or she is human, and will have faults that must be overcome or overlooked in the larger picture. <br />All in all, &quot;Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; is a necessary thorn in the flesh of the blustery bullies who would rather shout down than debate, rather win an argument than state the facts, and tell only part of the story rather than admit their dearly-held &quot;truths&quot; are actually cut from whole cloth.  <br />If you're offended, then it likely means you're part of the problem.	2003-10-04

And I like to be entertained while I learn.  The book, for me, fulfilled its promise, though people in Franken's line of fire will certainly be angered. Indeed, righteous anger, even bluster, seems their stock-in-trade. This is the kind of book people need in order to see the self-appointed, self-righteous commentators on the American political scene--like Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter and their like--in some perspective.  Franken describes (exposes might be a better word) their typical argumentative strategies--i.e., to lie, and then when they're called on it, to start dodging and weaving--and their plain misrepresentations of fact.  Franken and his team did the research:  they quote the transcripts, cite the facts, go back to the record to find what was actually said and compare it to what the subjects say they said.  They cite the statistics, do the math:  the record is there.  And Franken is honest about his own failed attempts at jokes (e.g., the foray into Bob Jones University), and he apologizes for such missteps.  Unlike the major subjects of his book--they never apologize for misleading the public and, indeed, seem to to it with relish, assuming that the most important priority of leadership is to work out favors for their major corporate supporters and chief beneficiaries. Franken puts his finger on something that resonates with me, especially with respect to Dick Cheney, but with respect to others in the administration also:  their meanness, their coldness; they use rhetoric cold-heartedly and as an intentionally duplicitous strategy, like the phrase \\"compassionate conservative,\\" then consciously do the opposite.  They exploit people's Christian faith by appealing to it and then doing the opposite of what one would think Christians would do.  Bush and his team seem actually hypocritical:  after participating in a supposed salvific, year-long exploration of two books of the New Testament, he can't remember anything about them.  Franken's account reminded me of an editorial I read after candidate Bush referred to Jesus as his favorite political philosopher:  the writer of the editorial pointed out that Jesus's teachings would have been just the opposite of Bush's proposals.  The Bush plan is to get conservative Christians on their side by appealing to their faith and making a show of sharing their beliefs; but it's really all about money and power.  Nominate some conservative judges here and there, but otherwise construct a policy edifice that benefits the wealthy.<BR>  In short, for me, this was a tremendous book--provocative, factually informative, and funny.  And it's a call to arms.  Conservatives have hijacked the word \\"liberal\\" and turned it into something nasty.  But their accusations against liberals often sound more like projections of their own mean-spiritedness.  Where does that come from?  Who thought of circulating the accusation that the Clinton White House staffers left grafitti, cut telephone lines, did disgusting, despicable things, so the Bush occupants had to spend $200,000 in repairs?  The GAO later reported that nothing of the sort happened.  But who thought of such a sleazy accusation?  If nothing of the sort actually happened, the idea could only have come from somewhere within the Bush conglomerate to make the Clinton people look trashy.  But it's the Bush conglomerate that gets stuck with the trashiness--it's in their minds, and the public is the beneficiary of that kind of thinking.  These are ignoble people.  The nobility and Christian humility are for public consumption.	2003-10-04

That Al Franken is funny goes without saying as he's entertained us for many years, most notably on Saturday Night Live and in his various television appearances/speeches. What is striking in this book is that Al Franken also knows how to research issues.<br />Basically, Franken takes statements made by Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, George W. Bush, as well as a host of others and then compares them to reality, to the facts. The result is at first humorous, and, as they sink in, quite depressing. Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda chief, once said that a lie becomes truth if repeated enough. After reading Franken's work it is clear that the neo-conservative right has bought into Goebbels theory. Even after Bush, O'Reilly, et al. have been clearly shown by Franken that their statements are untrue they keep repeating them. <br />In short, buy this book for some great laughs but be forewarned: you'll end up depressed when you see the direction we're being taken in.	2003-10-03

Like any typical episode of Saturday Night Live during its &quot;Golden Age,&quot; some of these chapters soar; others barely get off the ground.  But overall, the book is a damn good (fun?) read.  Just at the point at which Franken seems slightly full of himself, he is able to pull back in a very self-deprecating way; e.g. the chapter in which he flagellates himself regarding his initially over-the-top support of the war could easily have been omitted, but Franken is willing to tweak himself as well as the radical right.  <BR>One can't help but feel a slightly guilty pleasure in seeing Franken call these radicals on their lies and false innuendos.  According to Franken, the tone that has been set by Messrs. Rove and Bush is frightening.  The lengths they will go to manipulate the population to the benefit of their cronies is more than frightening -- it's borderline felonious.  Being able to laugh at it is actually cathartic, and for that reason, Franken has actually done us a service.  Franken's conclusion, however, is that once we're done talking and laughing about the current administration's crimes, it will be time to get serious -- and vote.	2003-10-03

IMHO, Franken is first a satirist and then a political commentator. If you have a robust personal filter that can chaff out humor from honest umembellished fact (charts and statistics, please note, are not always an objective representation of a fact) then you will find this book very enjoyable. <br />Given the polarizing impact of this book, I was expecting a lot of strident rhetoric and distorted tirade. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a fair bit of balanced, careful analysis. Franken makes a very convincing case of a number of pretty painful trivia about the Bush-clan's misgivings. Don't be surprised if you run into a chart or two even. <br />On the other hand if you are just too hung up on this whole left/right divide and believe vehemently in whatever side of the seesaw you're on, then maybe you ought to get Bernie Goldberg's book instead and develop that personal filter I was talking about..<br />I would definitely recommend this book.

I laughed, and THEN I cried, over and over again -- because everything he says is true. Hilariously, heartwrenchingly true. And that's the point. At a time when everyone is too lazy or apathetic to check into the facts -- especially reporters -- Al and Team Franken (14 Harvard grad students) took the time to research and document the facts. They show how so many of these &quot;fair and balanced&quot; &quot;journalists&quot; not only lie, but create news stories out of those lies by repeating themselves and quoting each other, until the stories are picked up by mainstream journalists and then echo about in our airheaded political consciousness and ultimately shape public opinion and history (i.e. the Gore lying story, the one about Wellstone's memorial turning into a Republican-bashing event, the vandalism of the West Wing). This is a brilliant book based on what has become a radical idea: report the things these people say and then do good old-fashioned journalistic research to find out if there's any truth to them at all. I highly recommend this book for everyone at Fox News, the New York Post, the Washington Times and their ilk, who could really benefit from seeing how actual research is done. And as for the boys from Texas... thankfully, they're probably too arrogant/misunderestimating to read this (don't tell them we're catching on to their dirty tricks!).	2003-10-03

He uses facts and reasoned arguments. He talks truth to power, and makes it fun at the same time. While the chapter on the vile distortion of the great Paul Wellstone's memorial service was ponderous, one gets the sense that Al was personally outraged at the smearing of his freinds memory to the point where he lost editorial clarity. This book inspired me to go back and read &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot&quot; which was perhaps more entertaining but less informative. That is simply because it offered more ad hominem attacks, as the point of the book is that this is exactly what the right does, but did not have the depth of research found in &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars...&quot; (In light of Limbaugh's recent self-immolation Al will need to change the title of his older book to &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Hypocritical Racist Drug Addicted Idiot.&quot;) Franken is funny, insightful, and one of a growing cadre of outraged thinking American patriots who are mad as hell at the extremist liars who are ruining our great nation. The biggest message to readers, especially younger readers who did not experience the viciousness of Nixon or the &quot;in your face&quot; lies of Reagan need to be fully brought to realize how dishonest their &quot;leaders&quot; and the media can really be.	2003-10-03

The book isn't balanced as is &quot;claimed&quot; in the title; 2. The book is full of lies; and 3. Al Franken isn't funny.  So, in order:<br />1. The &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; portion of the title is SATIRE.  It parodies Fox News' use of the same terminology to promote a blatantly conservative viewpoint, while attempting to represent itself as unbiased.  The author repeatedly makes no bones about his problems with the political right wing and the tactics its pundits pursue.<br />2. The statistics, articles, and transcripts cited in Mr. Franken's book are copiously footnoted, and have withstood repeated fact-checking by individuals and organizations from across the political spectrum.  Unlike Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter or their ilk, the author fully presents statistics and historical events without distortion, sins of omission, or worse.  If this troubles you, follow the citations in the endnotes and check for yourself.  If what you find shakes your faith in the easily-swallowed, black &amp; white, good vs. evil world presented by President Bush and his apologists and backers, you have no one to blame but the actual arc of history.<br />3. Funny is a matter of opinion.  Al Franken's humor has never been broad, and to be fair, while he is a professional comedian, the main thrust of &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars&quot; is not to generate chuckles, but to illuminate the dark distortions that have been propogated in the name of patriotism and conservatism (compassionate or otherwise).  That these distortions have been so numerous and so onerous means that there isn't a ton of time for lots of yuks.  It is to Franken's credit that there are still some truly funny asides, observations and imaginary scenarios scattered throughout.<br />I don't recommend this bookbecause I find it hilarious - although there were parts that definitely made me laugh - but because it is an insightful, accessible work supported by hard facts and documentation.  Refreshing and well-researched, &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars...&quot; is potentially a spark that will help diminish both the herd mentality and the quest for simple answers to complex problems that seem to have afflicted our great nation for the past two years.	2003-10-02

He doesn't talk of three party or more politics, but only so much can be expected from people. <br />This book is for people who are really into current events.

Even if Al Franken is abrasive or annoying at times, he still kicks butt with this book.

Anyhow, Franken's wonderful book speaks to a lot of these issues.  I would have liked the book a little  better if it had a few less made-up, tongue-in-cheek scenarios (always used to make a point) and more illustrations of how Americans are being duped by our current administration.

He argues that a poor black kid with an SAT score of around ~1170 should get more consideration than a rich white with with an SAT score of around ~1250.  Most people who are against race-based affirmative action probably believe that economic-based affirmative action is a good thing and would therefore agree with Al.  They would, however, object to a rich black kid with lower SAT score getting more consideration than a rich white kid.  While I think that a some form of affirmative action is necessary until an economic parity is achieved in racial groups, Al's argument didn't seem that convincing to me.  Also, let's face it, if you are a poor Asian kid, you probably need a score of ~1300 to get a similar consideration with his or her white and black peers. :)	2003-10-02

However there is a serious side to it, and this was best expressed by Mr Franken in the harrowing account of the negligence of the Bush administration in the run-up to 9/11.  The picture that he builds is one of hijackers preparing their missions whilst the security services screamed warnings at the top of their lungs.  The report that would have been read by the President recommending immediate action to combat terrorism worked slowly up the chain of command and eventually lay on his desk awaiting his return from the longest vacation of any President in 40 years.  And then BOOM!  That chapter alone was worth the price of the book.<br />I will make one criticism though.  Mr Franken does sometimes tend to lower himself to the same level as some of the people that he criticises.  Personally, I'm happy enough to hear him call Anne Coulter a 'nutcase,' but in doing so he is only giving the right some more ammunition to throw back at him.  Conservatives are fond of complaining about the dreaded liberals resorting to personal invective and claiming that it's a substitute for bankrupt political arguments.  By all means satirise and hit the conservatives hard, but don't become one of them in the process.<br />For the record I'm European and my views are slightly right of centre.  In American terms that makes me a leftist commie nut.  US politics are so far skewed to the right that more work like this is needed to give it a good shunt leftwards.	2003-10-02

Then read Al's book over and over and over again.  This book is a study of just how far the personality flawed right wing will go to win (for money).  To me, the RW represents hate, class warfare, racism, and lies.  <br />To those who say Al is too biased to belive all of what he says I have this to say:  You obviously are not as offended, frightened, and jarred as I am to clearly understand not what is being said by Al, but the high crimes and lies perpetrated daily by the Bush administration.  <br />I remember seeing my conservative OC bretheren on endless street corners at the onset of the Iraq invasion rallying our troops (?) and thought &quot;well at least they have passion if not truth.&quot;  Where the hell have they all gone?  <br />The best of this book details Al's multiple encounters with the enemy at large and winning with the simple hammer of truth on his side.

This book is meant to be funny, and downright hilarious it will be to anyone reading it without a frothy conservative vehemencence.  Even the opening remarks show Franken's brutal honesty in all things, and his ability to poke fun at himself.<br />The part of this most worth reading for me is the expose on Ann Coulter and her novels.  Like Franken will constantly remind us, the woman is messed up.  Literally, reading her books convinced me to take a liberal standpoint about many issues just so I would be on whatever side she wasn't.  Franken points out numerous examples of the many, many, many, many flaws in citation, source, logic, and general accuries Coulter's works have.<br />If I have one complaint about that book, it's that occasionally it's difficult to tell when Franken is joking.

The president too.<BR>I've heard Franken on NPR and he's not doing anything that the right doesn't do.  Rush Limbaugh rips apart liberals.  Liberals can rip apart conservatives.  It's one big war between the left and~~ right, and the madness of bias and prejudice pathetically takes over many's rational dissection of the issues.  I'm as liberal as can be, and to be honest, it's not so much because democratic politicians have convinced me, but because the vast majority of republicans have turned me off over and over again with their pandering to the rich.  Democrats who pander to the rich turn me off just as much.  I don't want the rich to own me (they have more than enough as it is), and I'm not so sure why so~~ many people like to have their political views owned by the rich who control the media.  I'm working hard to make sure Bush loses the next election, because he is the worst leader for this world, let alone for my country.  I think Al Franken agrees with that.  That's why I like him and his sense of humor.~	2003-10-01

First he totally discredits Ann Coulter, then he tears Faux News a new one. Every step of the way he injects humor. It is very easy to read and very well researched. He reveals the manipulative ways the right wing uses spin to create false impressions and even out-right lies. If you haven't heard about these lying liers yet then this book should be quite enlightening (maybe even shocking). But if you know or suspect that the right wing bends the truth to get support, then this book is a fun ride and a valuable reference resource.	2003-10-01

The non-reader from Lincoln would know this if he/she had actually read the book. The chapter on the 2000 election was one of my favorites.  It includes a transcript of Sean Hannity either lying or showing how ignorant he is.  Probably lying.  In his book Franken makes a fool of O'Reilly, Hannity, and Coulter. Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot was funnier than this one, but I don't hold it against Franken.  It is hard to make jokes about some of the more serious topics.  I didn't believe the republicans when they tried to say 9-11 was Clintons fault but now I know how outrageous those claims were.  The Clinton administration was way more aware of the threat of terrorism than the pre-9-11 Bush administration.	2003-10-01

As a person who has enjoyed Al Franken in the past, I could not be more disappointed in this book! Of the &quot;facts&quot; and opinions contained in this entry, the supposed facts are almost completely created out of fiction, and the opinions are simply angry personal attacks without support.

That should be a pre-requisite, rather than using amazon as a venue for their close-mindedness.  If you want to have a REAL opinion, read the book.  Just as I also read Rush Limbaugh's book.  That way, when I want to argue about it, I know what I am talking about (I just try to buy it second-hand so it doesn't count for his book sales).  Al - your book was phenomenal.  A real eye-opener.

This is definitely the best book I've read so far this year. It is thought provoking, sharp, intelligent, and very funny. It is not, however, as funny as Franken's earlier book, Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot: And Other Observations. But then again, I've never read any other book as funny as that one, so it's not really a fair comparison.<br />So, Lies seems very well researched, and makes claims which, if true, offer proof that the Bush II administration and many of the leading conservative commentators have lied repeatedly about the most central aspects of governing, including terrorism, the war in Iraq, economic policy, the environment, and a host of other issues and events. But isn't this just the other side of the Ann Coulter books which make the same claims about the left, and offer \\"proof\\" which is completely fabricated?<br />No.<br />First, as someone who keeps up with the news, it was easy for me to spot many of Coulter's fabrications on my own. Indeed, they were so numerous and striking, that I decided to write an article about them, and began taking notes. But before I really even got started, it occurred to me that I was probably not the only person who had noticed this. So, I did a Google search, and I found many, many Web pages which thoroughly, page-by-page, catalogued the literally hundreds of factual errors she makes in her books.<br />So, naturally, I expected someone to do the same to Al Franken. He's doing it to them in this book, so he's practically daring someone to expose his errors. But I've searched and read articles with Google for more than four hours trying to find someone who will say that Franken made a single factual error in his book. But no one has reported a single one. Not one! <br />And it's not because people love Al Franken and don't want to attack him. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of outrageous, vicious articles that verbally tear Franken apart in the most hateful ways. But none of them can point to a single factual error in the book. Some of them express doubts about his first-hand accounts. Some of them point to pranks he's pulled (that they only know about because he reports them in the book) as evidence of Franken's dishonesty. And many call him a liar with no evidence at all to support that claim.<br />So, I'll just say it. Based on what you can read about in Franken's book, George W. Bush is a liar, and he knows it. Dick Cheney is a liar, and he knows it. Bill O'Reilly is a liar, and he knows it. Ann Coulter is a liar, and she knows it. (Actually, we all already knew about that last one even before Franken pointed it out). They lie again and again, and they keep getting away with it. The difference between the right and the left is not that the right lies in a way that helps the right, and the left lies in a way that helps the left. The difference between the right and the left is that the right tells lies, and the left tries to be fair. <br />And we all know that's true. What are the so-called \\"liberal-biased\\" papers? The New York Times and the Washington Post-- the two most respected newspapers on the planet! And what is the conservative press? Fox News and the Washington Times and the New York Post, all of which are just a joke in terms of journalistic standards. Who are the heroes of the right-wing media? Rush Limbaugh! Ann Coulter! Sean Hannity! Bill O'Reilly! And these people make a living by just making things up. And they get caught over and over, and when they get caught, they say, \\"Oh, so in my 300 page book, all you could find was this one mistake,\\" or \\"In my six and a half years on the air, all you could find was this one mistake.\\" And they say that line again and again about dozens of different \\"mistakes,\\" where by \\"mistake\\" they mean \\"lie\\". And, as Franken points out, the mainstream media, with it's supposed \\"liberal bias\\" is asleep at the switch. They are letting them get away with it, again and again, afraid that if they point out that only one side is alwayslying, then they'll appear to have a liberal bias. <br />This is a great book. It is as entertaining as it is infuriating. You should read it.	2003-10-01

I read several reviews that attacked Franken as being just like Coulter, Hannity, etc by creating an environment of &quot;attack politics&quot;.  It's satire people!  He's trying to get you to open your eyes, take off your blinders and realize that you can't simply take what Bill O'Reilly et al say as truth.  He's trying to get people to wake up and think for themselves.  He's not suggesting that you simply believe what he tells you.  <br />The point of the book is that Americans, by and large, have become too complacent and too lazy to THINK for themselves and that the Right wingers have taken advantage of this apathy and used it to spew their doctrines.  Several points in the book DO point out actual lies told by various Right Wingers.  He also points out, and shows his readers how to dissect those arguments and find the facts.	2003-10-01

I am a former conservative who saw what it meant to be a conservative earlier this year (illegally invade another country, murder babies, and humiliate any person who is against doing this). I still don't like liberals, many of whom would love to see this country blow up. Al Franken is the current favorite of liberals now and that's why I was afraid to read this book. However, I came away enjoying his expos of Bill O'Reilly, whom I religiously hate and think should be stoned to death. He also makes sense during his &quot;Dialogue on Terrorism&quot; section, which is hilarious. I like how he keeps putting Alan Colme's name in a smaller font than Sean Hannity..it is very symbolic. I definitely recommend this book to any moderate or liberal. Conservatives...well, it will keep you in denial or it may make you wake up.	2003-10-01

It was all a crock they thought they could truly hide their hypocrisy through those endless calls of treason or unamericanism that it would actually stick in people's heads and they would believe it.  <BR>Al Franken took all those comments with a grain of salt and then tore them to shreds.  He attacked them for their simple lies in an attempt to push their agenda.  Their hypocrisy in their attacks on Clinton for Kosovo then going and saying that people like the dixie chicks were out of line over their statements.  Then he also did something that I was actually quite proud of.  He shed new light on Clinton and Gore and showed that they are not the people the conservative pundits have painted them as.  Clinton did many great things in the element of building national defense and fighting terror.  And it was Bush that dropped the ball his fist eight months.  \\"Operation Ignore\\" he (Franken) called the bush doctrine on terror prior to 9/11.  <BR>He also made sure to show that those pro-war pundits were dreadfully inconsistant because Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tom Delay, Dick Cheney, John Ashcroft and many more, spent a total of 0 years in the military.	2003-10-01

The book is funny, but rather disjointed.  It is an &quot;attack&quot; type approach using the same type of dirty nasty techniques as the Conservatives, except it contains humor.   The problem is that Franken did not have to resort to out right lies or half truths when presenting certain facts such as how the incoming admin's Conglese Rice was not interested in Sid Berger's reports about the danger of Al Qeda and what needed to be done.  She and the admin wanted to concentrate on Star Wars until Sept 11. Even a review of Karl Rove's dirty campaign against McCain is included - the independent pollster's (actualy Rove's Republicans workers) telephoning people in South Carolina if they would vote for McCain if they knew he fathered a black baby (it was a kid he adopted from Banglades).  Items like this are surrounded with Franken's sarcastic and biting humor, but these are facts that the conservatives are ashamed to hear.  Franken lays it all out so you can expect to see some bitter comments from the humorless Right wing here.	2003-10-01

If you are a right-wing fanatic, you should read the book as well.  At the very least you can learn a little about how to use footnotes (or endnotes to anyone who has taken high school writing classes).  Hopefully people will also take the time to learn how to use a LexisNexis or Google search.<br />One major point of this book, as Franken makes clear from the onset, is to force readers to independently verify claims - whether it's right-wing Ann Coulter or Franken himself.

I honestly looked. Pretty hard too. And I couldn't find a single one.<br />Now, granted, I was able to discern when Franken was joking, which obviously some of you can't. At any rate, Franken has, yet again, create one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br />There were maybe 10 or 15 pages in the entire book that I didn't laugh while reading and most of those were during the chapter about the really sickening tactics Republicans used regarding Paul Wellstone's death and funeral.<br />Let me state clearly that I'm NOT a Democrat. And I doubt I ever will be. But I'm also NOT a Republican. I'm a strange mix of Libertarian and Green. (Figure THAT one out!) But after reading this, I have all the more reason to hate what the Republican Party has done to this country.<br />Is it possible that Franken is lying about all of these lies? Perhaps. But when you have transcripts that he quotes from (no, not out of context...), when you have quotes from the accused people themselves, when you have quotes from people like Bill O'Reilly's Mom (ha!), when you have an actual tape of people doing exactly what Franken accuses them of (the C-SPAN incedent), it's pretty tough to figure out what Franken is lying about.<br />So, here is the challenge. If all you Republicans out there are SO convinced that Franken is lying, show us. Give examples. Heck, I'll settle for a single example. Something as damning as O'Reilly lying about where he was born? Something as damning as the Homeland Security proposal HANDED to the Bush administration by the outgoing Clinton administration? Something as damning as making up statistics on the fly to shut up somebody who disagrees with you? Anything!?<br />And once you've done that, trying reading David Brock's &quot;Blinded by the Right&quot;. It's not nearly as funny, but it's just as damning.<br />It's time for America, and Americans, to grow up. Do you really want to contribute to what has become a sham of a democracy? Or do you want to try and fix that which is clearly broken.	2003-09-30

I never really listened with much interest to the crap coming from either the far left or the far right. Both extremes seem nutty and scary to me.  But having read this book I have to say there were a LOT of things about the extreme right that I really wasn't aware of, particularly how they have taken control of the media, the Republican party - and consequently - the country - and have done so using gutter tactics.  These people are a disgrace.  We have to get rid of them and get some decent, people back into the top political offices of our country. I've voted for both main parties over the years.  But I will NOT vote Republican again until decent, honorable, reasonable, normal thinking human beings (like John McCain) are back in charge of it.<br />I loved \\"Supply Side Jesus\\". It amazes me that so-called \\"Christians\\" would advocate supply-side economics and cutting back on programs to help the poor.  Wasn't Jesus all about helping the poorest amongst us?  \\"That which you do for the least of my brothers, so you do unto me?\\" Didn't Jesus say something like that? And \\"Do unto others as you would have then do unto you?\\"  I thought Christianity was supposed to be about being a decent, caring human being and helping others. Isn't there something in the bible about that being the pathway to heaven?  Hypocrites.<br />The big thing I wasn't too aware of was how many top administration officials got deferments from the Viet Nam war. Wolfowitz, Perle, Cheney and of course, Bush, to name only a few.  I was SHOCKED.  How DARE they send other people's kids off to be killed when they wouldn't go themselves?  HOW DARE THEY!! How can they look at themselves in the mirror when they get up in the morning?  Bush started a needless war that we can't get out of; created havoc with the economy and pissed off our friends and allies around the world.  Good job Mr. Bush.  I'm sure you're a hero to your fellow right wing nuts. The rest of us however, are disgusted.

I've read parts of his books and all I can see is his deep red hatred of anyone who doesn't agree with him.

Publicly calling people liars? He darn well better be sure what he's saying is accurate.\\"  This book does what good writing should do: open your mind and make you think.  Plus, it is side-splittingly funny in places. Anyone who wants to get an understanding of how the extreme-right-wing media and associated politicians and mouthpieces manipulate facts should read this. Indeed, I'm one of those who usually takes what is reported in the media without a lot of thought regarding the accuracy of what is being said.  I'll be a little more critical about that from now on.  I don't always like Franken's style which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.  He can be harsh and crude although I'll grant that is deliberately done sarcastically for purposes of entertainment and provocation.  In any event, this is still a factually solid, highly recommendable and extremely important book.  Both entertaining and eye opening.<br />I'd like to offer some comments about the one-star reviews here:<br />1. It's obvious that many of them - if not all - were written by people who have not read the book.<br />2. Its obvious that quite a few are from the same person signing in under different names.<br />3. The hatred and ignorance (and just plain lack of ability to write clearly and logically using correct English grammar) that is spewed by these people merely serves to prove the basic point that Franken puts forward: that the extreme right wing has no interest in truthful, rational political debate and relies on lies, insults, paranoia and deceit to advance a narrow-minded, mean-spirited political agenda of greed. God help us all if the people of this country don't wake up to that fact and start voting accordingly.	2003-09-30

No kidding - every American should read this book.  At the very least, anyone who intends to vote in an American election should read it.  <br />I thought the title was funny - I didn't realize that it is a literal description of the contents. Franken manages to keep you laughing with his ironic commentary as he exposes lie after lie after lie put about by the minions of the far right, but the fact is, the truth that is revealed here is very disturbing.  The very ease with the lies have been exposed is truly frightening - as Franken says, these people don't even have enough respect for their audiences to think they might check up on something.<br />If you believed any of the myriad accusations against Clinton, if you believed Al Gore tended to exaggerate, if you ever believed a single word Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Karl Rove or George W. Bush ever said, read this book.  Al Franken just might make you think, make you question, make you look and listen past the sound bites.  <br />Next time you find yourself outraged because of something the &quot;liberals&quot; supposedly did, take the time to find out if it really happened.  Then, and only then, express your outrage to the appropriate party.  Given the track record Franken exposes, I am guessing you'll be outraged at being lied to again. Again, again, and again.	2003-09-30

Informative As Well As Entertaining	For anyone who has managed to catch a bit of mainstream-media news in the past several years, this book is for YOU.  If you want to know the REAL story, instead of the mainstream media LIES, Al Franken manages to outline the major issues in a funny, and very entertaining manner.   <br />For anyone who is a major fan of Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity or Bill O'Reilly, you should definitely read this book (but I'm sure you won't)!  These news personalities are no-doubt ashamed, as well they should be, at what they let pass as journalism.<br />This is definitely the best book I've read all year.

That being said, I can already sense where the rest of this book is going. Now, that's not an entirely BAD thing, but it certainly isn't good either.<br />Thus far, &quot;Liars&quot; has proven to be an entertaining read, most noticeably due it being written by AN ENTERTAINER. There is not doubt in my mind that Al Franken is indeed intelligent, well-versed and thoughtful. He raises some good points and questions when it comes to the credibility of pundit Bill O'Reilly and author Ann Coultier. I definitely find them both to be holier-than-thou and closed-minded.<br />My problem comes into play because; much like Coulter &amp; O'Reilly, he is digging for dirt on them to disprove them as much as they do to others. One minute, he criticizes Ann Coulter for namecalling on Katie Couric and others and ends that chapter of his own book by calling her a &quot;b*tch&quot;. Sounds a tad hypocritcal to me.<br />Some will complain that Al Franken is a comic trying to compete with &quot;informed talking heads&quot;. While this may be true on paper, he proves himself to be no less credible a source than O'Reilly and others. He digs for facts and figures and presents them in an informative manner, all the while being entertaining and even humorous.<br />Unfortunately, it's authors of both ilks; liberal and conservative, that espouse their own &quot;facts&quot; riddled with opinions and utilize underhanded tactics to discredit the other, all while the rest of us either blindly choose sides or sit here like we're watching a tennis match for idiots. Personally, I don't trust either side or the governing bodies that they claim to represent.<br />Overall, I give &quot;Liars&quot; 5 stars for being refreshing to read, presenting another side to the Fox News hounds while explaining himself well and for being an intelligent, critical thinker for the left that is riddled with just as many talking heads and sloganeers as the right. I also give &quot;Liars&quot; 1 star for the namecalling, finger-pointing and cheap shot tactics he accuses the right of using and vice versa. It's a worthy read but I'm with &quot;a reader&quot; when I say I'd rather hear the actual story and decide for myself.

The sun is really purple. She just used a lot of references to make it look like she did research. Anyone can make up those things. I did it better than she did. The right-wing conspiracy is lying about the sun being yellow. They want to deny poor people a chance at seeing the sun. We need to tax rich people so that all children can learn that the sun is purple. Rich people is anyone that isn't liberal. Ann Coulter is rich. We should pass a law to make her apologize for being rich.&quot;<BR>Ann Coulter - &quot;Furthermore, you could get a sun-burn by staying out in the noontime sun too long without sunscreen.&quot;<BR>Al Franken - &quot;That's right-wing lies. At least one liberal professor said otherwise. Ann Coulter is obviously racist, along with Rush Limbaugh, because they don't want poor people to get a tan. Those lying liars won't re-elect Bill Clinton, and that proves that they hate children.&quot;<br />I never knew until now that I could write a book just like Al Franken's.	2003-09-30

He starts out well, mauling the losers who really deserve it: Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, Colmes.

I liked his book, \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot.\\" Although this book had the same themes, it was far more emotional, subjective, and vitriolic in its tone, and that detracted from the credibility of his case. The book wasn't even humorous - just angry and bitter.<br />I was particularly interested in the chapter on O'Reilly - a pundit who deservedly draws fire and should get out of the kitchen if he can't stand the heat. But what should have been strong writing quickly dissolved into petty name-calling that certainly wasn't worth the cost of the book.<br />I highly recommend Peter Hart's \\"The Oh Really Factor\\" instead. The book carries a similar theme to Franken's but the case is much better presented. The humor is more indirect, smarty, sly and edgy: something I expected in Franken's book and just didn't find.	2003-09-30

Al Franken seems to try to imagine various right-wing scenarios that he dreams take place behind closed doors (that obviously annoys him to no end) and tries to derive comedy from it (he fails in that regard as well) and spin political capital out of these dreams.  If he's the best the left has to offer, I might just go out and register Republican soon.<br />Likely the most telling about he and Ann (I choose her because he devoted quite a bit of space to her) is how they have acted when they appear on political (okay, so Al never really gets invited on a major show) talk shows.  Whil Al just babbles and rants, Ann makes points and what first caught my attention was when she is always confronted with the &quot;...McCarthy ruined lives!&quot; argument.  Ann always asks, &quot;Name one life he ruined.&quot; and no one has ever called her on it with a name.  That right there is very telling.  I grew up believing that McCarthy was responsible for a lot of political terror and in a major way responsible for the addition of &quot;...under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance (BIG mistake), so her stuff was hard to swallow at first.<br />I expected this book to be a decent rebuttal of what I saw as Ann's too-good-to-be-true slam-dunk of left wing foibles, but halfway through, aside from some skimming of later chapters, I couldn't continue.<br />Anyone want to buy a half-used Al Franken book...cheap?	2003-09-30

Obviously you CAREFULLY read Mr. Griffith's post.<br />I'll address your points one by one:<br />1. You said Mr. Griffith stated that the Republican party controls the media.  That isn't what he said. Obviously you CAREFULLY Mr. Griffith's post before mouthing off.<br />2. You railed about Mr. Griffith's comments regarding church and state and capitalism and a free society etc. Your comment here makes no sense in regard to the point he made.  He was commenting that he agreed with Al Franken's contention that the so-called Christians who advocate such things as supply side economics that help the rich and hurt the poor are, in fact, very un-Christian.  Such people, if they truly wanted to see the manifestation of the word of Christ in the world, would be advocating polices and programs aimed at helping poor people, not gaining further tax breaks for people who are already filthy rich.<br />3. You said the only allies we upset were those who had an economic interest in Iraq.  Wrong.  Check the facts on that one.  You will find a great many countries that had no economic interests in Iraq were opposed.  But even if they did, how does that make it unacceptable for them to freely choose to avoid participating in an UNNECESSARY war? A clear headed reading of Mr. Griffith's statement is that he agrees with Franken's contention that it is hypocritical and morally reprehensible for people who evaded military service to start an unnecessary war and send others to die in it.  He didn't even mention that they used lies and deceptions as an excuse to start that war, which makes it even more reprehensible. Mr. Griffith did not say he felt it was fine that Clinton did not serve either.  He was merely commenting on the present situation.  I too agree that it is stomach turning that many of the top military advisors of the country, as well as both the President and Vice President, who evaded military combat service themselves, have started an unprovoked war which is throwing this country into an economic crisis and killing hundreds of kids (with no end in sight).<br />Check your FACTS sir, before posting.

He fails to mention all of the reports about Bin Laden being in custody of Sudan and that Clinton could not find a legal reason to arrest him in 1996.

Clinton did nothing in response to either of these acts of terrorism.

This is an astute response on my part to the unfearing &quot;challenge&quot; by one of the thousands of faceless, liberal cronies impersonating &quot;reviews&quot; on this page. One of them actually had the audacity to intimidate people he, self-damagingly and nervously, thinks are all cons, based on their 1-star ratings, to provide proof of Frankenut's liberal lies. I think he even went so extreme, in his increasingly crumbling presumption, to claim that he only ever saw one internet site that offered some form of expose of Frankenut.<br />Not so. At Townhall's website, columnist Michelle Malkin wrote a piece from August 22, detailing Frankeninny's veracity problems.<BR>Here is one of the most notorious and lucid exposes of Al Franken's lies. Just type in this handy little URL into your web address bar: <br />townhall.com, forward slash, columnists, forward slash, michellemalkin, forward slash, mm20030822.shtml<br />You should get the filthy dirt on Al Franken pretending to be the self-righteously moral &quot;martyr&quot;, leading his fellow insane left-wingers out of the desert, by unscrupulously stigmatizing the right as being the worst liars.<br />Yet this four-eyed, coke-bottle glasses, middle-aged NERD is such a soullessly shameless LIAR, that he ACTUALLY used deceptive tactics to generate material WHILE writing this book which he falsifies is solely about right-wing &quot;dishonesty&quot;.<br />To preview, a little, within that provided address, Franken resorts to about 4 sub-lies within his gigantically broad lie of using Shorenstein Center stationary (that's right, the same cancerously twisted, radical left-wing elitists who helped compose his &quot;book&quot;) to dupe John Ashcroft into sharing his experiences with abstinence. Franken again lied that Ashcroft's personal story would be used in a book he was writing about abstinence programs in our public schools. Which are, AGAIN, more lies based on original L-I-E-S.<br />This brings me full circle to the dissolutely unprincipled &quot;testimonies&quot; from all these liberal-wrecked reviewers. How in the HELL can these unconscientious creatures NOT ONLY keep blackening the right as &quot;viciously distorting everything&quot;, but also keep praising their superficially veneered, hero-jacka$$ Franken as a rolemodel of virtue?!?!

Unlike the targets of this hilarious book, Franken never stoops to lies and insults but instead does something far more effective: he examines their statements and holds them accountable according to publicly verifiable data. Well, OK, he does insult them to some degree but only on the basis of their own proven lies.<br />If you are conservative then this book may be a bit difficult to swallow. One thing that might help is to keep in mind is that Franken isn't out to tarnish conservative values, just to expose the lies and the \\"myths of convenience\\" that are deliberately perpetrated by rightwing extremists. If you are liberal then this book may prove to be a breath of fresh air. After years under siege by right wing think tanks, shock jocks, and the consolidated corporate media, the left finally has a popular and entertaining voice of its own. And to make matters sweeter, he doesn't have to lie to be popular.<br />Exactly how does Franken take on the likes of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and other rightwing pundits? Together with his Harvard research team, Franken examines their broadcasted or published statements to determine their veracity. Using publicly available search tools such as LexisNexus and Google, Team Franken, as he and his research team are called, examines the various claims of famous rightwing extremists not with the deliberate intent of proving them wrong but simply to see if they can verify that they are correct. In the process of doing this, Team Franken not only exposes their numerous false statements, but also the methodology they use to generate them. Perhaps the most shockingly mendacious of this lot is Ann Coulter, who extracts words from her target publications andrearranges them with no background or context in order to ascribe to them an entirely different meaning. It's sort of like taking the words \\"Al Franken\\" and \\"lies\\" from this review and claiming that my review states that \\"Al Franken lies\\" when clearly it does not. Coulter also deliberately overloads search tools with extra words when she wants to claim that a target publication ignored or failed to print a story. As anyone who uses search tools can tell you, the most effective way to find what you are looking for is to start with the fewest words possible and to progressively add more as you narrow your search. It will be interesting if Coulter, an attorney, ever defends her conduct by claiming she didn't know how to use search tools properly.<br />Franken also goes after the heavy weights such as George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove, and Paul Wolfowitz and exposes how they mislead the public mainly by \\"slight-of-hand-lying\\". The most obvious example, according to Franken is the Bush tax cuts which the Administration claims will save the average American over $1,000 a year. But the keyword in this example is \\"average\\". Franken demonstrates that if you average his salary and Bill Gates' then the result is several billion dollars ON AVERAGE. This does NOT mean that each person has several billion dollars. Proceeding from this example, Franken provides charts that demonstrate how most Americans will gain very little from the tax breaks while those who earn over $300,000 will save a lot.<br />Another example of \\"slight-of-hand\\" lying is the manner in which the Bush Regime addresses the total tax burden of average Americans and promises to relieve it with a tax cut. But what the Bush Regime deliberately fails to mention is that the tax cut is an INCOME TAX cut. Most of us (i.e. those of us who earn less than $300,000 per year) pay a combination of income taxes and PAYROLL TAXES, but the Bush Regime's tax cuts are only income tax cuts which means that individuals earning over $300,000 per year will get a substantially larger proportional tax cut than the rest of us or, put another way, our tax burden will be greater than theirs. Payroll taxes go toward such things as medicare and social security, but it is an accepted fact among all but the most indeologically right-wing economists that the Bush Regime's run-away deficit spending will ultimately result in the dismantling of social security, medicare and other social programs that we currently fund with our payroll taxes. A simpler and more honest way to look at it is that the Bush Regime is transferring the social security surplus to the super rich. That's right, our payroll taxes equal their tax cuts. Slight-of-hand lying.<br />Finally, Franken takes on several \\"myths of convenience\\" including the purportedly liberal media that is owned, managed and edited by conservatives and generally advances the interests of corporations and the state. Franken also demonstrates that most \\"hawkish\\" conservatives avoided serving in the military during the Vietnam War or, as in the case of George W. Bush, used whatever methods were at their disposal to avoid serving in combat. Franken also demonstrates that it was Bill Clinton and not the current administration that implemented a technical revolution in the military that directly contributed to its success in Afghanistan and Iraq. Finally he points out the multi-billion dollar missile defense program rammed into law after 9-11 will not protect the United States from its most dire national security threat: terrorist attacks. <br />If you disagree with the conclusions of this book, or you simply dislike Al Franken, I recommend that you do what he did; use Google and LexisNexis and check his facts to see if they hold up. But be aware that if you do this, you are already departing from the methodology used by the people that Franken critiques in this book, since you will be verifying facts instead of telling lies.	2003-09-30

In fact, Chapter 25 must be a complete embarrassment to the children of Senator Wellstone, especially when they are associated with a vitriolic, cursing name-caller named Al Franken. But what's really embarrassing is his obsequious pandering in the 5 pages of Acknowledgements - he thanks dozens and dozens of DNC lapdogs because Al wants to be a player, not a washed-up comedian doing skits at ten-of-one in the morning. Al Franken is clearly the nobody on the playground to be picked last for the team. This probably explains his propensity to be threatened by beautiful Republican women such as Ann Coulter - he knows he never had and never will have a chance with a gorgeous woman. Instead, he's stuck with leftovers, so he needs to vent his rage, which he does quite well. The guy is on the edge. I don't know why Franken takes umbrage at the Chambliss / Cleland campaign - he should be proud of the dirty tricks in which he himself is so willing to engage! The writing reflects the person writing the book, i.e., &quot;as the right was spreading filth, sleaze, and bile&quot;. Very good Mr. Franken, you do it well yourself!	2003-09-29

If you're a democrat, moderate, or a republican wondering about who hijacked your party and when, you should be interested in this book.  What's happening within GOP circles reminds me of the 1940 movie &quot;The Mortal Storm&quot; (look it up on Amazon).. sane conservatives are cowed by the new breed of cruel, jealous, cynical and vengeful neo-cons.  I live in Illinois, where republicans and democrats are neighbors and friends.  But I can tell from conversations that republicans are horrified by the viciousness that's infected their party.<br />The stories in Al Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; are often humorous.  But they can become sad and frightening, especially the tale of how the neo-con spin machine soiled Paul Wellstone's memorial with an oft-repeated lie, and made regular folks believe it was something that it clearly wasn't.  It's frightening how often &quot;mainstream&quot; TV news correspondents easily believe lies, once they've been repeated enough times.<br />Franken sticks pins in lie after lie floated by the neo-con disinformation machine.  Franken blows away Bill O'Reilly's claim that he was born and raised in working-class Levittown (he wasn't, O'Reilly's own mother says Bill was raised in an affluent suburb).  And yet a recent &quot;Parade&quot; magazine, published AFTER the claim was debunked by Al, STILL repeated O'Reilly's Levittown story.  It's not the only pile of neo-con bull-ploop that Al Franken sweeps away.<br />The research is right on the money.  It can all be backed up.  There are plenty of laughs, not the least of which would be found in the tale of &quot;Supply-Side Jesus&quot;.  But there are serious parts, and this is serious.. this is our country being hijacked!	2003-09-29

It's clearly not fair or balanced, but THAT'S THE POINT!!!... Franken does much of what he criticizes in the right wingers, because he clearly (and I think justifiably) feels somebody to the left has got to fight back in the same terms. So amongst all the very amusing and spot-on critiques and rooting out of truth behind the lies-a-plenty, there seem to be a few dubious, less well-founded arguments.<br />But on the whole Franken seems like he's making an honest effort to reverse the spin with well-researched truth and he's even willing to criticize himself in a couple of places. This book is somewhere between Palast's 'The Best Democracy Money Can Buy' and Moore's 'Stupid White Men' in its tone and content, so if you liked both of those you'll definitely like this.	2003-09-29

I'm a conservative and this book isn't going to change my opinion on a lot of issues.  But it did wake me up to the fact that the extreme far right has taken over the media and the Republican party.  Quite frankly (no pun intended . . . well, okay, pun intended) REAL conservatives need to read this book more than liberals because we are the ones who are being painted with the same brush as the likes of nuts like Falwell, Limbaugh, Ashcroft, etc., etc, and all the other far right idiots who have taken over the Republican party.  Come on people - let's get behind a REAL, decent, honourable conservative - John McCain (who, by the way, SERVED his country when called to do so, unlike a certain person currently in the White House - who hid from military service himself but has no problem sending other people to their deaths in a needless war.)

The first half of the book is excellent as it clearly establishes the right wing to be intellectually dishonest and more interested in empty rhetoric than a serious discussion of the issues.  Frankin tears apart recent books and public statements by Hannity et al to show that their factual arguments and charts are one-sided and prepared by ideologues.  In a moving chapter, Frankin also shows how the conservatives launched an attack against liberals by arguing (without any basis) that the public memorial for the late Sen. Wellstone was nothing but a political rally.  Conservatives repeatedly made this argument even though many of them admittedly did not witness the memorial.  But they passed along that lie as if it were true, possibly causing the Republican senatorial candidate from Minnesota to win the 2002 election.  <br />Much of the book is funny and will make you angry at the sorry state of political discourse in this country, but the Wellstone chapter will enrage you in light of the callousness of the modern conservative movement.<br />Docked a star for Frankin's loyalty to Clinton/Gore.	2003-09-29

And I enjoyed it.  A lot!  I enjoyed it because Franken does an incredibly thorough job (with the help of TeamFranken) at reviewing a lot of right-wing rhetoric.  And, more to the point, he shows his work.  He shows his work so well that one can go to the sources and check them -- something I've done with a few of the more disturbing points (for example, the fact that much of the plan for a cabinet level Homeland Security Office and prioritizing our efforts against Osama bin Laden by putting ground forces in Afganistan came from the Clinton Administration well before the tragedy of 9/11 -- call me a stupid liberal, but I didn't know that! -- Maybe because the current administration really doesn't want me to!).<br />What amuses me about the book's title and tone is that Franken seems to be mocking the ad hominem attacks and vitriol that he criticizes in much of the conservative rhetoric.  Unfortunately, a cursory review of reviews seems to suggest that this tactic, while amusing, left much of Franken's hard work vulnerable to a tu quoque (&quot;you too!&quot;) response from the right (forgetting, of course, that &quot;tu quoque&quot; is a rhetorical fallacy).  And to those one star on-line and popular reviews that claim that Al Franken is a liar, I think the burden of proof is on your shoulders to show YOUR work.  Otherwise, saying the same thing (&quot;Al Franken is a liar!&quot;) over and over again until you believe it is true is, well, exactly the phenomenon that Franken asserts is the problematic SOP of the the radical right.<br />To be sure, the book has its good points and its less good points. The good points, though, are good enough to offer hope to a country in crisis.  Early on in the book Franken captures what is, I think, at the heart of the clash between liberals and conservatives.  Conservatives love this country like a four-year-old -- mommy can do no wrong and all who say anything against her arebad, bad, BAD. Liberals love this country like adults.  We believe in an open society that remains constantly vigilant of its policies and actions, aware that the best intentions can lead to bad decisions.  We love this country enough to be honest about our past and present wrongs as well as our past and present triumphs.  We know that this country, like all healthy loving relationships, benefits from open and honest dialogue.  Indeed, most liberals know that we need conservatives because their views matter and should be part of the on-going national dialogue always in search of the best course of action, the most appropriate policies.  If only the conservative right were willing to publicly grant a similar value to liberals.  Instead, &quot;liberal&quot; has become a literal devil-term in most of their rhetoric, synonymous with &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;corrupt,&quot; &quot;immoral,&quot; and &quot;America-haters.&quot;  I submit, with Al Franken, that it is more courageous, more brave to love this country by acknowledging that it is not now and never has been perfect.  That ability, more than a hawkish willingness to assert ourselves militarily, is what makes this country the &quot;home of the brave.&quot;<br />Franken's target, then, isn't so much conservatism as it is the all too prevalent trend in right-wing rhetoric to &quot;win at all costs&quot; by saying anything.  For example, his point isn't to nit pick O'Reilly about the details of which award he won or what part of Long Island he grew up on.  Franken's point is that O'Reilly and his ilk have used lesser untruths to dismiss many a politician and more liberal commentator, thereby shutting down dialogue. The point is that O'Reilly, a journalist (!), is seemingly incapable of admitting to a mistake, apologizing, and correcting it -- especially a mistake like the Peabody Award claim that he used on multiple occasions to assert his own credibility and dismiss others'.<br />So, to Al Franken, thank-you for a book that at its heart really only calls for fair play and honesty in the media/political debates of this country. I could wish optimistically that one book would be enough to turn the tide away from &quot;say anything&quot; cynicism that seems to rule the halls of govenment and media alike, these days.  At the very least, I hope this book is part of a growing trend of frustration in this country with people saying anything and then getting away with it -- a frustration that will hopefully have consequences in the voting booths come November 2004.	2003-09-29

Find a review that disputes the facts.  I'll save you the trouble.  YOU CAN'T.  Franken's book is very well researched and provides irrefutable evidence, (mostly the words and deeds of those he criticizes). One would expect George Bush, Dick Cheney, Bill O'Reilly, or Anne Coulter, (the LIARS depicted on the cover) to at least make a case about the so-called hatchet job that Franken has afforded them.

It of all of his books is the strongest both in it's comedy and in the evidence used against it's intended targets.<br />While, I deeply value free speech as any Americans should I think it's extremely disapointing to see so many people who simply disagree with Al Franken's views ignorantly and immaturely knocking this book and claiming he doesn't back up his statements.  Which, if you actually read the book you will find he uses quite a lot of evidence provided by the right wingers themselves.<br />This book certainly isn't for everyone and some may find the opinions contained within offensive.  This however, doesn't give you the right to pretend you have read this book and act like a bitter child by writing a fake review in a pathetic effort to 'scare' people away from an excellent book which has recieved many accolades.

O'Reilly went on to claim that he had never stated that &quot;Inside Edition&quot; had won a Peabody.  He portrayed himself as a victim to journalistic attacks.<br />This is patently false.  And this is the bigger issue.<br />Don't get distracted by the trivial confusion between Peabody and Polk (just like you shouldn't get distracted by the &quot;16 words&quot;).

(The one-star Amazon reviewers don't count because they obviously didn't even read the book... HULLLOOO??)<br />But I have found nothing substantial from web searches... Fox News, Washington Times, Weekly Standard, WSJ, and Rush Limbaugh are all silent.  I did however find one book review from columnist Byron York of the National Review, but instead of rebutting the factual points, he just derides Al's humor and tone.  Lame. <br />If that is the best that the right can come up with to debunk this book, then Franken's research must have been pretty solid, even if you never bothered to verify Franken's footnotes (which I did).<br />By the way, I think Borders and Barnes &amp; Nobles both lean to the right too because at my local stores, they both put Al's book near the bottom of the Humor section while OReilly and Coulter are on the top of the Political Science section.

Everything in this well-researched book is backed up impeccably.  Plus, it is side-splittingly funny in places.  This book does what good writing should do: open your mind and make you think.  Anyone who wants to get an understanding how the extreme-right-wing media and associated politicians and mouthpieces manipulate facts should read this. Indeed, I was one of those who simply took what was reported in the media without a lot of thought regarding the accuracy of what was being said.  I'll be a little more critical about that from now on.  While I did find one or two spots that -to me - were kind of dragged out longer than necessary this is still a highly recommendable and important book. Very entertaining and eye opening. <br />As a side note -  I am absolutely amazed at the hateful commentary in the negative reviews here.  First of all, it's obvious that many of those reviews - if not all - were written by people who have not read the book.  Second, its obvious that many of them are from the same person logging in under different names.  Third, the hatred, ignorance and bigotry these people spew merely serves to prove the very point that Franken puts forward - that the extreme right wing has no interest in truthful, rational, unbiased political debate and instead resorts to lies, insults, fear and deceit to advance a narrow minded political agenda.	2003-09-29

His command of sarcasm, irony, and above all else, comic timing, is nearly without peer. This book is a perfect example of why his works are so popular - hilarious, insightful, inflammatory, and even touching. I loved this book, right down to the endnotes!<br />One thing I have to point out, though, having read many of the comments here, both one-star and five-stars, is that some people are missing the point.<br />Al is not saying that all Republicans are bad, that all right-wingers are fruitcakes, or that every conservative is a liar.<br />He is pointing out how a small minority have hijacked both the government and the media and turned it into a free-for-all of lies, manipulation, and deceit. He explains how these people exploit patriotism, &quot;Christian values,&quot; and fear to pursue power and money to an extent never before seen on this planet. He backs up every one of his assertions (at least the serious ones) with deep research (thanks to TeamFranken, his group of Harvard scholars), something that the people he criticizes apparently fail to do. He points out that certain members of the right-wing media constantly take quotes out of context, or politicize issues that should never have been politicized (like Wellstone's funeral, which he actually attended).<br />Franken clearly states the problems with the Bush administrations' claims to be for the common American. He lays out the lies (very creatively, I might add - I particularly liked his one-act play) that led so many Americans to believe that the Bush tax cut and economic policies would actually help the average Joe or Jane, and backs it up with real numbers and quotes in context (from actual reliable research). He explains that the program cuts perpetrated by this government have harmed millions more than they have helped. He describes the inconsistencies around the Administration's rhetoric leading up to the Iraq war. He explains how some right-wing media icons (O'Reilly, Limbaugh, even Coulter and Hannity) distort the facts, misquote Democrats, and even flat-out lie in their various formats. And, throughout it all, he does this with a combination of frankness, eloquence, self-deprecation, the occasional expletive, and a heckuva lot of research.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone, even if you proclaim yourself solidly implanted in the right. If you are a right-winger, at best you might be entertained, or even learn something that will help you see the way a few people have hijacked your party with lies and deceit on the grandest of scales.

If you like to think of yourself as openminded and a friend of truth you ought to try reading several chapters of this book before passing judgement on it... While some chapters might go down poorly with a nonliberal, I think that &quot;The Waitress and the Lawyer: A One-Act Play&quot; and &quot;Operation Ignore&quot; alone are educations that make up for the cost of the hardcover book. Entertaining, too.<br />I am reminded of a debate I had three years ago with some young friends who favored privatization of Social Security, then a key proposal of the Bush-Cheney campaign.<br />Privatization seemed too good to be true. I was troubled, so I discussed the issue with older, retired friends, who pointed out that the point of Social Security was the &quot;security&quot; bit. Low returns aside, you were assured that you _would_ get your savings back. The fundamental problem with privatization is that you can't time the market when you need to retire.  If the economy is down when you have to retire, you are out of luck and may cash out at a loss. If you aren't a lucky investor (even if a hard worker) you are also in trouble.<br />However, my pro-privatization friends cited a study done by the well-respected conservative Cato Institute, which examined the wildly successful privatization of pensions in Chile. How could you argue with 11% returns? I went to the Cato site and noticed that their co-chairman on Social Security was Jose Pinera, the architect of Chile's pension plan! Rupert Murdoch is on the Board of Directors! I examined an article on the Cato site by a L. Jacobo Rodr&iacute;guez and was disappointed to find that the numbers in the charts didn't even add up correctly. The 11% return is a myth after adjustment for loads and unique economic conditions.<br />In addition, many important issues were neglected or glossed over in the study.  I'm not at all educated in economics so I may be way off, but little or no mention was made of:<br />1.What looked to me like a whopping front-end load of 27% of the investment and a minimum expense ratio of .84% on the Chilean pensions<br />2. Fixed commissions meaning higher management costs percentagewise for smaller investments (i.e. higher costs for poorer people)<br />3. Low participation rates in the programs except where mandatory and nonreversible<br />4. No accounting for the effects of the other changes in the Chilean economy at the time, including inflation<br />5. loss of public benefits such as public healthcare and education<br />I realized that if you but scratched the surface of Bush's economic policies, they collapsed into rot and ruin. Not many people would have the time to add up the numbers in a 23 page study, but would take the word of their politician that his sources were reliable and disinterested. We need the media to help us check facts, not muddy the waters further!

Honestly, the biggest reason to read \\"Lying Liars\\" is to laugh.  Like Franken's previous \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot\\" and Michael Moore's \\"Stupid White Men,\\" this book adds something that is more or less completely absent from 95% of the other political and social commentaries that are released every month from both the left and the right--humor.  Though you probably need to be at least somewhat familiar with people like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity in order to get some of the jokes, in general it's a pretty damn funny read (unless of course, you're a big fan of one of them).  In fact, I would actually have preferred he stayed on the wisecracks rather than go into more serious topics like Paul Wellstone's funeral and the surrounding brouhaha, although most other people count that chapter as one of the best, so I guess it's a matter of taste.<br />Overall, it's a solid new entry for Franken, especially the bit about the incursion into Bob Jones University.

I was wrong; it's all about Al Franken except for the chapters written by his ghost writers.<br />With sharp wit using a jagged edge Franken looks for comedy in all the wrong places mixing fact with fantasy and using partial truths to prove his feeble or pointless points all along managing to take politics personally delighting in being able to write about his inciting fights for fun and profit without the benefit of the WWF so he can publish it in his next book. While the personal and professional attacks - both physical and simple factoids - were expected in the name of humor and the free press, the fictional cartoon &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot;  is a new low even for Franken as he shocks the spectrum of Christianity with this sacrilege. <br />Gore takes a backseat which is expected given that he still loves the Clintons but took time out to fight for Gore in 2000. However, he shows his fear of anything remotely conservative or even middle-of-the-road. He longs for the glory days of pre-1994 when the Democrats dominated government and liberals ruled the news, and now loathes that society is changing prefering Republicans in the Adminstration and Congress, and even in Judges. But he sounds more like what Hillary than Bill or even Al in this diatribe.<br />Who is Al Franken? It's not clear he can answer the question. Is he a comedy writer, a contra sycophant bashwriter, or just a political shill? Nah, he is just the water boy for the Clintons with his anti-Bush, pro-Clinton view as the writers bash their way through anything and anyone conservative, demonizing with half truths in hopes of getting work. Mixing fiction, fact, fantasy and fun, Al Franken still has yet to have any book become a movie. He is trapped by TV land and the shortage of quality Harvard students to research and write  material. But he certainly knows how to build a cadre of liberal comedy writershe can bill for.<br />Yes, Mr. Franken has a reputation to protect of being impervious to pain and criticism instead turning his sour grapes into a fine lemonade. Al and his fifteen Harvard ghost writers could have done better but Al needed the paycheck. However, Al Franken can now afford to change his name to Frankenstein, and no one would be the wiser.	2003-09-28

I'm probably more of a Progressive Blue Dog Democrat in that I'm conservative fiscally but not socially.  So that is the perspective or \\"spin\\" from which I write this.<br />I really think it is unfortunate the extent to which American politics has become polarized in George Bush's America.  There is a real unwillingness to compromise or to recognize that the other side may have some good points and I think it is this attitude that actually got Mr. Franken riled up again (last time he was riled he wrote \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\"). <br />I'll confess I'm not totally hostile to conservatism, but what I respect is more the old school conservatism than this Neocon phenomena we are seeing today.  After the war came to this country in 2001 another attack took place here at home, it was an attack on everything having to do with the left wing.  I think \\"Political Correctness\\" has it's place and just like right wing issues like \\"State's Rights\\" it can be carried too far by people of poor judgment and sensibilities.  The primary problem with people like Anne Coulter and Rush Limbaugh is that they are answering the excesses of the left with excesses of the right and it does not serve the common good.  It serves to divide America in time of war.<br />I think after 911 the country shifted to right for understandable reasons.  The attacks were horrific, terrorism is about fear itself and represented a new and terrible change in our perception of the world.  Conservatism is to some extent about mitigating the pace of change, sure it gets snarled up in modern discourse on various issues but that is what the basic notion is.  Unfortunately as you go further right you approach something that leaves traditional American conservatism behind.  You approach something that allows for only one point of view and in the name of patriotism seeks to purgeopposing viewpoints.  It's hardly new, perhaps the most famous examples were the Alien and Sedition Acts in the World War One era.  Right wing radio doesn't talk about this gray area.  It's actually one of those enigmas of American history that the Supreme Court has not ruled on extensively and where we as a nation are still defining what we are.  I think it's important to really point out that not all conservatives are happy with the Patriot Act and other contributing factors to the break down in cooperation between the left and right in 21st Century America.  I will say this, those who are perpetuating it need to be called on it because America can not afford to be divided in a time of a new type of World War.<br />That's why I think it is perhaps only natural that the man who most directly addresses it is a nationally known satirist.  Who else but a comedian to interject himself in a subject this serious?  Who else to test and maintain first amendment guarantees but a humorist, even if the book is really on a very serious subject.  The book is in some respects a populist rebuttal of the attempted purge of the left on the part of some radical right wing elites in the wake of the 911 attacks.<br />One has to consider what it is that provokes Franken to write books like this.  He's criticized for the title of it but he's a satirist and chose the title for a reason.  Many of the people who attack him have been saying and doing largely the same thing, the title leads to a guaranteed \\"pot calling the kettle black\\" situation.  I'm immersed in politics, I follow it, I read an immense amount of the discourse on both the right and the left.  The thing about Lies is it is new in the sense that it does what the right wing media has been doing for many years.  It takes what they have been saying and effectively turns the tables and reverses it.  It's researched by a group of grad students (which may or may not be good if you are familiar with grads) but it is factual.  However in a very real sense it is not exclusively about the \\"facts\\", there is a larger satirical point to this just as there was with Franken's book about Limbaugh.  Limbaugh has a habit of calling people names and where he got into trouble with Franken is when he called 13-year-old Chelsea Clinton a \\"dog\\" on national television.  Franken took this as bullying and so he did what a 13 year old girl could not do, he called Rush Limbaugh a \\"Big Fat Idiot\\".  Again with this book the irony is in the \\"turn around is fair play\\" aspect.  Rush and others have been calling names for years including calling a teenage girl ugly and calling all liberals liars, depraved, sissies, and immoral.  <br />Well as it turns out there is enough to go around and in addition to the \\"liberal media\\" you had best watch the bias in the \\"conservative media\\" because it is if anything more pronounced.  I'm somewhat amused because all the dittoheads and so forth seem to think Al Franken invented this and don't appreciate that his satire can at times be far more sophisticated than that which was shown on SNL for 15 years.  My advice: politically speaking look around you at how you are doing, your family, your neighbors, your community and make decisions based on that.  Don't let talking heads like Limbaugh and O'Reilly make up your mind, just \\"factor\\" it in with a grain of salt.  If you are a conservative don't dismiss this out of hand, take into consideration the context in which is was written and the larger but very simple statement it was intended to make (even if you disagree with some particulars of course).	2003-09-28

So, what are the great LIES that Franken points to? Here it comes folks...I'll save you the cost of the book: Bill mistakenly called an award that his former show had won by another name.

Even if O'Reilly deliberately said the wrong  name of an award;What in the world does that have to do with him being fair and balanced about politics?

I wouldn't have known<BR>that Franken wrote a second book if it weren't for a snipit on<BR>All News Radio about a certain network suing Franken for copyright infringement, or something like that.<br />The book title pretty much says it all and Franken has ample proof that the Right Wingers embelish half truths or flat out lie<BR>about it.  The chapter on Ann Coulter is hilarious. I don't know<BR>a whole lot about her and Franken doesn't really focus on her bio<BR>just her penchant for abusing footies. She reminds one of Jar Jar<BR>Binks from Stars Wars. Maybe the physical resemblance, the long stiff neck, the doe waxen eyes, the big ears, but maybe because<BR>both are such annoying characters.<BR>The saddest and most disturbing part is Franken's accont of the<BR>events following the Paul Wellstone memorial and how a distraught<BR>best friend's momentary ranting was enough ammo for the Right <BR>Wingers to trash the presence of 20,000 people who showed up to mourn a painful loss.

I'm still laughing at Franken's wonderful non-fiction piece of literary work. I probably wouldn't have purchased this book had it not been for Fox News raising such a stink about using the phrase &quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot;. But I thought if Fox was so upset about it, then this guy Franken must have something going. Of course, the pictures on the front cover said enough, but that's neither here nor there. The book has humor and great information about how things HAPPEN in politics. I've often thought Cheney was running the White House, but I guess it's Karl Rove according to Franken. I was a big O'Reilly fan for a long time, and I slowly began to realize how he was treating the guests on his program. And this thing about the Peabody &amp; Polk awards that I learned about in Franken's book, well...that really turned me off with O'Reilly. So thanks, Al.  I'll be looking forward to reading more of your Liberal books.  Keep up the good work. From the ratings you're getting on this one, looks like a lot of people like what you have to say.

He exposes the methods Coulter, O'Reilly, and Hannity (among others) use to take information out of context (or if that doesn't work, just flat out lie) to make their point. O'Reilly in particular is exposed for being a phony going all the way back to his days as an anchor for the highly acclaimed news program &quot;Inside Edition&quot;.

Just type in this handy little URL into your web address bar: <br />townhall.com, forward slash, columnists, forward slash, michellemalkin, forward slash, mm20030822.shtml<br />You should get the filthy dirt on Al Franken pretending to be the self-righteously moral &quot;martyr&quot;, leading his fellow insane left-wingers out of the desert, by unscrupulously stigmatizing the right as being the worst liars.<br />Yet this four-eyed, coke-bottle glasses, middle-aged NERD is such a soullessly shameless LIAR, that he ACTUALLY used deceptive tactics to generate material WHILE writing this book which he falsifies is solely about right-wing &quot;dishonesty&quot;.<br />To preview, a little, within that provided address, Franken resorts to about 4 sub-lies within his gigantically broad lie of using Shorenstein Center stationary (that's right, the same cancerously twisted, radical left-wing elitists who helped compose his &quot;book&quot;) to dupe John Ashcroft into sharing his experiences with abstinence. Franken again lied that Ashcroft's personal story would be used in a book he was writing about abstinence programs in our public schools. Which are, AGAIN, more lies based on original L-I-E-S.<br />This brings me full circle to the dissolutely unprincipled &quot;testimonies&quot; from all these liberal-wrecked reviewers. How in the HELL can these unconscientious creatures NOT ONLY keep blackening the right as &quot;viciously distorting everything&quot;, but also keep praising their superficially veneered, hero-jacka$$ Franken as a rolemodel of virtue?!?!

I loved that show but never quite understood why Mr. Franken was on there. He wasn't funny and detracted from an otherwise superb show. Since that time I have learned why Mr. Franken needs to have a platform to speak his views and why he uses comedy as that platform. He is obsessed with conservatives, so much so that he goes to great lengths to prove his views even to the point of, at best, distorting the facts (to give him the benefit of the doubt). He always assumes the motives of those he critiques are evil and works from that base. He is of the type that believes that 'the end justifies the means' and whatever it takes to destroy what he knows is bad is okay in the big picture. He is an intellectual eliteist from the same camp as the Clintons and the Gores, etc. These are people who believe that the general population is stupid and thay need to think for us. Since the end justifies the means, so whatever they need to do to force their ideas on the stupid commonors is justified. While at the same time always pretending to be `one of us'. On the one hand the liberals want everyone to think like they do and on the other hand the conservatives want everyone to act like they do. Both sides seem to be out of touch with real people. Mr. Franken uses comedy because it allows him to be slanderous and insulting while avoiding the legal penalties. In the end he is niether funny nor insightful. Hiding behind comedy to spew his hyper-crital judgements is niether fair or balanced. He may be very intelligent but that horsepower isn't able to get to the pavement in this project. In the end it's a lot of wasted energy, both for the writer and the reader. This is one to avoid.	2003-09-27

For readers who share Mr. Franken's political views, the book is a hilarious, insightful, and well-researched criticism of the right wing media and its outspoken talking heads.  Although Franken occasionally goes over-the-top with some mean-spririted and vulgar observations (which he claims to get away with because he's a comedian), his commentary for the most part hits its mark in a unique way...by relying on documented facts.<br />It's interesting (and depressing) that almost all of the one star reviews were posted by people who didn't even read the entire book.  This observation alone supports Franken's view that &quot;right wing nutcases&quot; will offer harsh criticism without any substantiation.  I bet some of these poor reviews will end up in the paperback version of &quot;Lying Liars&quot;!<br />Read this book for what it is: a comedian's view of the right wing media and its far-reaching influence that reaches the presidency.  It is funny and harsh.  The far right simply will not get it, ultimately because unlike Mr. Franken, they lack an appreciation for humor and self-deprecation.	2003-09-27

Unlike Moore, though, Franken's latest is a rapid-fire discourse on lies told by who he considers the right-wing. <br />The facts on the lies are all attributed, and to this point I have not heard one person attacked in the book counter Franken's breakdown (They instead retort to labeling Franklin a hate-filled liberal. Why? Because he speaks the truth?) Franken keeps a book that would normally be of heavy subject material light with sarcastic humor scattered throughout the many chapters. His humor isn't of the &quot;pound-you-over-the-head&quot; variety we hear from many comedians of this day. It is more subtle humor, one that takes a degree of intellect to understand.<br />This book is an excellent companion to &quot;Rush Limbaugh...Idiot,&quot; and puts Franken in his rightful (no pun intended) place on the mantle of successful political writers. It's a must-read for anyone who takes what O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter, Bush or Cheney say at face value without obtaining a dissenting opinion.	2003-09-27

Al Franken resorts to what many liberals do instinctively when they write about the right.

Bush is or dismissing an idea or statement by rolling their eyes and reminding me that I'm quoting Tom DeLay and thus the idea is not even worth responding to.<br />Al Franken hates with the same fury that Ann Coulter hates; the difference being that Coulter at least backs up what she says with facts, dates and figures. Franken just calls her a &quot;nutcase&quot; and uses his wit to put down individual conservatives and neocons. And the best part about it, from his standpoint, is he doesn't have to do much research. Just sit down at a computer and bang it out. Ha-ha.<br />All-in-all, these people are name callers. There's no substance in this book and probably would have purchased my own copy had it sold for seven or eight bucks.<br />If you're a liberal Democrat or Republican, you'll get a few laughs out of &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them,&quot; but no real insight.

Franken investigates their argument structures and points out, well, lies.  I'm sorry, but if you cook numbers to support your argument (Sean Hannity, Franken pgs. 95-101), lie about your (not) dirt poor upbringing (Bill O'Reilly, Franken pgs. 73-74), or misquote news sources to support your opinion (Ann Coulter, Franken pgs. 13-15) you are a liar.  As thinking people know, and Franken underscores, when you lie about the little things you insult your audience and undercut your own credibility.  Additionally, his statements are backed up with incredible amounts of research, he explains his research techniques (so you can re-run the searches if you don't think he's being upfront about the results), and honors his incredible research team, TeamFranken.<br />I'm hoping there is a *good* conservative response to this book with similarly thoughtful, well argued and ethical writing.<br />If you like to laugh and hate stupid people, regardless of your political affiliation, you'll love this book.

Ann Coulter and Sean Hannity are high profile hate-mongers among the barely literate in this country and this requires that they be discredited at every opportunity.  Franken does this well by showing that, in addition to being dishonest, Hannity and Coulter are incredibly incompetent (Coulter doesn't know how to perform a literature search well enough to find a front page article in the New York Times; Hannity is unable to understand basic arithmetic.)  The Wellstone Chapter is excellent.  Franken is dead-on in pinning Bush with responsibility for much of the right-wing poison being spread around.  He doesn't let him off with the hook with the &quot;he's too stupid to know what is going on&quot; excuse.  The NYT book reviewer is mostly right concerning &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot; and the fictitious Vietnam War story.  &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot; is at least fairly short and to-the-point, the fictitious Vietnam War story just isn't funny and goes on far too long.   One of the best things about the book is that when Franken uses facts, they are indeed FACTS.  As I read the book, I took pleasure in the jokes, but also in knowing that it would drive the right-wing fanatics crazy trying to find errors.<BR>  Books about the Right's descent into corruption and viciousness are scary and disturbing, at least with Franken you get a good dose of genuinely funny material to keep you from getting too depressed.	2003-09-26

What I found is something entirely different:  A well-researched, even scholarly review of how right-wing Republicans have systematically lied and cheated their way into power, and of how they maintain that power by employing the corrupt and dishonest right-wing press.<br />Even though Franken's delivery is, for the most part, light-hearted, one can't help but become a little depressed at the extent to which the political system has been subverted through the use of blatent dishonesty and corruption.<br />I'm not sure how even a self-respecting Republican could read this book and not be disgusted with the likes of Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, O'Reilly, Hannity, and a host of others.  The facts are simply too well-researched and too overwhelming.	2003-09-26

Unless I missed something, I can only recall one that actually tried to refute something specific of the content of Al Franken's book.  That person said that Colmes is not the only liberal pundit on Fox News, there's also Geraldo Rivera (and although Geraldo may have lots of liberal positions on things, I wouldn't exactly consider him to be a partisan liberal or conservative, I think of him more as just a tabloid-sensationalist idiot).  Other than that, none of the negative reviews went into any specifics on trying to rebut or refute the actual content of the book.  You can see that as a result, most of the one-star reviews got low &quot;helpfulness&quot; ratings (&quot;two out of 16 people found this rating helpful).  If you look at the 5-star reviews, you will see that most of them have pretty decent &quot;helpfulness&quot; ratings.  I don't know, my review probably hasn't been very helpful so far.  I enjoyed the book, but I wish he had posted more footnotes (or &quot;end notes&quot;, whatever he wants to call them).	2003-09-26

Al Franken brings up such topics as: Ann Coulter and her unresearched ravings that were somehow considered to be non fiction, the Fox News Channel (specifically Bill O'Reilly), the media's supposed &quot;left bias,&quot; the 2000 and 2002 elections, and, of course, Bush and his henchmen.<br />And instead of Ann's &quot;it's in the footnotes&quot; (of which, there weren't any), Al will often cite the sources on the page and/or make a copy of it for you. <br />I do have to say that despite this book's funny side, it was somewhat depressing.

I actually didn't mind this book so much - unlike &quot;Treason&quot; by Ann Coulter, Al Franken was less acidic and sharp-tongued...just somewhat less mean (enough already, Ann!).  This is not to say that I agreed with many/most of Franken's assertions, it's just a stylistic note.  I do like Franken's easy writing style - it makes for an entertaining read and a good gauge of what the &quot;Angry Left&quot; is feeling.  Oh and you guys are very miffed!  Truth and logic will do that to liberals...but I don't think average liberals &quot;hate&quot; America as angry Ann Coulter asserts they do - so I do agree with Franken on that point.  Franken, however, failed to convince me on most other arguments.  The media indeed has a leftist bias, he just needs to get a grip on that and realize that Fox News is just ONE network - one.  I've seen too much bias on and in CNN, CNBC, NBC, CBS, ABC, the NYT, the LA Times, Wash Post, etc. etc. to believe otherwise.  Talk radio is mostly conservative but only because liberals have failed thus far in that medium.  Did he convince me that the Bush admin is corrupt and dishonest?  No.  Making gaffes, blunders, yes, but corrupt, no.  That he would ignore the Clintons' corruptness (not counting the sex scandals) in light of all his finger pointing at Bush is interesting.   <br />But he is a funny guy!  So I enjoyed the book without blowing my ring-wing stack which should be a really big complement to Mr. Franken.	2003-09-26

I enjoyed \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\" and hated \\"Why Not Me,\\" so I was ambivalent about picking up this one. But with all the hype over the Fox lawsuit, I decided to give Al another chance.<br />I should have saved my money. Not because Al doesn't make some good points, but because \\"Lies\\" is something of a bore.<br />Al is right on target when he is listing the lies that the right-wing media parrots on a daily basis. And a lot of his criticism of President Bush is accurately placed as well. His sources are well-researched and appear to be fairly accurate.<br />Where he goes wrong is when he's trying to be funny or ironic. Unless you know the specifics of the instance that he's talking about, you tend to lose track of where the true facts end and his ironic asides begin.<br />And Al, if you're reading this, please leave the swearing to Dennis Miller. He does it well, even when he's making fun of himself for doing it. (He's the self-described E.B. White of the f-word.\\") When you do it, it becomes a breach of the reader's concentration, and causes a loss of focus.<br />I also dispute his point of view that Clinton was the best thing to happen to the military. I left the Army just before Clinton took office; and all of my friends that stayed in told me that the Clintons viewed the military with contempt and did their damndest to tear it down with the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" and other \\"kinder, gentler\\" notions. That plus the \\"globo-robo-cop\\" missions of Somalia and Bosnia stretched our troops to the breaking point.<br />To be fair, I have to put the same onus on President Bush. After the disinformation campaign that fueled his call to war with Iraq; I think it is history repeating itself that he is calling on our troops to make such sacrifices while simultaneously cutting their pay and benefits. This way of \\"doing it on the cheap\\" will only continue to get our troops killed. Either do it all or not at all.<br />And while I am no fan of taxes on anyone, I think it is a load of crap that Bush has cut the taxes of the richest at a time when the need is greatest for a strong Treasury. If I spent the kind of borrowed money (proportionally) that he's spending, then they would lock me away for fraud.<br />If you're looking for a book that covers the same ground as Al does but without all the foul language and sophmoric attempts at humor, I would recommend Eric Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media?\\" Alterman, an unabashed liberal, covers all the right-wing columnists and TV pundits better than Al does, with the suggestion that it is the money trail that really dictates what these people say. And Alterman also takes Clinton and Gore to task for their shortcomings, something that Al Franken doesn't do.is a load of crap that Bush has cut the taxes of the richest at a time when the need is greatest for a strong Treasury.

For the first half or so of the book, I just laughed and laughed as Franken brilliantly and with tremendous honesty and detail nailed all the b.s. that's been flying out over the airwaves and even onto the bestsellers' lists recently. <br />Then, as the book progressed, I began to cry when I realized the serious issues at stake here. The fact that (as Franken admirably details) President Bush and his administration rejected a thoughtful bi-partisan counter-terrorism campaign which would have prevented 9/11, and in its place offered nothing, is beyond tragic. It's a  form of negligence and dereliction of duty that is deeply shocking, and merits further scrutiny. <br />How ironic that right wing critics attempt to smear Bill Clinton with the failure to protect us from terrorism, when as Franken clearly demonstrates, it was Clinton who launched and sustained the most successful counter terrorism efforts of any modern president.<br />If  his successor had possessed the leadership to merely continue Clinton's efforts, rather than reject them for purely partisan reasons, thousands (and counting) would not have died.<br />Franken does our country a great service because in doing all the hard journalistic research, while presenting the facts he uncovers with humor and irony, he arms readers with real and necessary information provided in a highly entertaining way. As a result, it's easier to perceive and accept the painful truth as we must to make wise choices in a democracy. <br />Thanks, Al, you are a patriot and an inspiration!	2003-09-25

I read as much as I can from both sides of the political spectrum and find some real gems that are both entertaining and well researched... Then I come across books packed with weak arguments that can only be presented with rhetoric and half-truths.  Franken's book is the latter.  To give you an example of rhetoric and half-truths that I often see from the left are the personal attacks on conservatives' intelligence.  With the exception of Newt Gingrich (and perhaps Dick the V.P.), I can't recall one major figure that has not been accused of being incredibly stupid.  What is never shown is a head to head comparison of degrees attained, schools attended, GPAs, and idiotic declarations.

Well, if Franken has done his homework, and it appears that he has, then the right wing could tell a whole lot of lies and Franken has proof.  Sometimes of course they don't tell outright lies, they just use the part of the truth that suits them and forget the rest.  Sometimes they even tell the truth, then lie about that.  Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of very honest and well-meaning people on the political right.  Unfortunately many of their leaders are neither well meaning nor honest.  Want some examples?  Al has plenty.<br />One of his favorite targets is Bill O'Reilly who Franken has caught just making up facts and figures as he goes along.  Of course if one is on O'Reilly's show and one happens to know the correct figures one can't correct Mr. Factor because he will start yelling at you to shut up and will turn your microphone off.  I have seen him do that myself so I know Franken is not making it up.  O'Reilly is of course not the only mouthpiece of the far right that Franken has caught in bald face lies.  He also catches Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Newt Gingrich, Dick Cheney, and of course good old George W., among others.<br />This book is a very easy read but you have to pay attention for some of Franken's humor is very subtle.  The facts are here, these guys and gals have lied and for that matter have lied early and often.  The chapter on Barbara Bush especially intrigued me; I would never have guessed it.  I also love Operation Chickenhawk, Operation Ignore, and the chapter entitled, \\"This was not a memorial to Paul Wellstone\\" was particularly informing.  Of course, those of you on the right are not going to like this book at all.  In fact, you probably won't read it but I figure you will trash this review.  Still, this is a funny and informative book that deserves high marks.  It would have been an easy five stars but Al goes after the Confederacy in a rather harsh manner and in that one instance he has no statistics to back him up.

The low tolerance level's and blind hatred just permeates. Good examples of the Republic party and it's short sighted thinkers. Well maybe not thinkers, I should say Knee-jerk reactors.	2003-09-25

This statement, which is tangential at best to anything Franken says in the book, screams out for correction.<br />When secular liberals embrace the false dichotomy of Science vs. God, they play right into the hands of the so-called &quot;Christian&quot; Right.  People like Jerry Falwell have spent millions of their ill-gotten wealth to spread the message that they are the only true Christians (in other words, that God allows them to decide whom to exclude from heaven).  Unfortunately, this tactic has been working.  There is a Christian Left (founded 2000 years ago by some guy named Jesus), but to listen to the mainstream &quot;liberal&quot; media, you wouldn't guess it.  Journalists are always referring to the &quot;Christian&quot; vote, as if all Christians (or indeed, anyone at all who follows the teachings of Jesus) let Ralph Reed tell them how to vote on, say, a local highway bond issue.  (This alone is ample evidence of the lack of &quot;liberal bias&quot; in media.)<br />Come on, now.  Do you really want to split the vote in this country between &quot;Democrats&quot; and &quot;those who believe in God&quot;?  The &quot;Christian&quot; Right would love to do this!  Liberals who really want to give the Right fits would do well to get up early on Sunday morning and walk into a mainline (non-fundamentalist) Christian church.  Then, do it again every Sunday.  It isn't as scary as you think, and you may even meet nice people with whom you have much in common.  If even a million of us did this, we would be hitting the Right right where it hurts.<br />Franken does an excellent job in demolishing the hypocrisy of the &quot;Christian&quot; Right, better than most.  In chapter 26, he demonstrates how easy it is, even for a Jewish non-Christian, to beat a self-proclaimed Christian of the conservative persuasion (in this case, Commerce Secretary Don Evans) in an argument on the New Testament (in this case, the book of Acts).  This is often easier than you think.<br />Franken's Supply-Side Jesus comic strip  sounds outrageously disrespectful, but if you look at the whole thing, it does Jesus proud.  At the end, Pilate asks the crowd whom they would condemn, Supply-Side Jesus, or Jesus of Nazareth.  Supply-Side Jesus wins his freedom by bribing the crowd with tax cuts, and Jesus of Nazareth is crucified.  This is actually dismally close to the position of many on the &quot;Christian&quot; Right.<br />Franken's book is not about the religious right, however.  After all, the agenda that motivates most of the Right in this country has little to do with Christianity.  If you want to read a book about the hypocrisy of the religious right, try Stealing Jesus by Bruce Bawer.  As a side benefit, you will hear from an actual practicing Christian some genuinely appealing arguments for Christianity (hint: heaven and hell have nothing to do with it).<br />The real meat of Franken's book is the factual refutation of the shameless lies of some on the Right, he has done an admirable job.  Let's start with the title: Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.  Now there's a title that goes straight for the jugular!  The problem with titles that go straight for the jugular, of course, is that they are impolite and uncivil.  <br />The Right has a double standard when it comes to &quot;civil discourse&quot;.  Right-winger Ann Coulter releases a book loudly claiming the 50% of Americans who hold progressive views are guilty of Treason!!!  Right-wingers everywhere applaud, saying we suspected it all along, saying anyone who dares to dispute this fact is a liar.  Al Franken displays a similar title, and right-wingers everywhere are indignant.  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.  Just ask Bill O'Reilly.<br />Fair and balanced, indeed.	2003-09-25

Al Franken is a funny guy, and we all know that humor, especially effective humor has more than a little truth. But this battle between Liberals and Conservatives is bizarre. I truthfully don't know, nor do I care, if I am a liberal or a conservative, or a mutt, all I know is that though I don't agree with everything here, I was immensley entertained and I think that was a huge part of the author's intention. A book, a single book, isn't going to convert a nation unless it is populated by morons, and anyone who is fanatically biased as a Conservative or Liberal could quite possibly also be a moron.

Like another Harvard alumus, Conan O'Brien, he does lampoon with agility. He also likes to make stuff up as he goes and this book is full of it (literally). He obviously doesn't like Bill O'Reilly or especially Anne Coulter, but in Ms. Coulter's case, there is close footnoting of the contents and if you don't believe her, look it up and read about it for yourself. Now obviously, Ms. Coulter really, REALLY hates liberals (and who can blame her), but unlike Mr. Franken, she chooses her sources and documents what she says. She, of course, chooses those sources which most strongly support her argument (and all writing follows that lead), but it is supported by documentation none the less.<br />Mr. Franken's book, like the one before it, is a liberal's attempt to set things straight for his cause by name-calling and spitting vitriol without the sense to back it up. He shouts over you, using the often employed strategy of persuasion by volume, not by intellect. This is too bad, as all well developed opinion should include getting both sides. This is not the place to obtain the liberal bent on things, as you will think all liberals are wannabe socialists or communists taking your money via huge, all-intrusive government in an effort to redistribute the country's wealth. This is what Al Franken would like (and many other liberal Democrats as well), but is hardly a &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; overview of anything other than being short and bitter, with furry hair and nothing much to show over the years since &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; but a few writing awards and a couple of tee-shirts.<br />Do not buy this book.

This book must really be touching a big nerve with the more insecure members of the Right...look at how the Dittoheads and Freepers have been coming out of the woodwork lately, posting more non-substantive &quot;reviews,&quot; offering vague critiques of a book they obviously haven't read, complaining about a &quot;shrill&quot; or &quot;bitter&quot; tone by Franken which is nowhere to be found in the good-natured and humorous, but deadly serious, book I read and thoroughly enjoyed. They have yet to offer even one single refutation of Franken's facts or arguments, proof they haven't read the book and thus don't know the facts or arguments he presents, (or they simply cannot dispute his cold, hard facts).<br />I also accuse these folks of being un-American and unpatriotic: among the distinguishing attributes of our society, one of the greatest is our freedom of speech and thought, and our ability--as a society--to contain diverse opinions and points of view. From the synthesis of these many voices and ideas, we arrive at a lively and progressive society, with great innovation in every field, from the scientific to the artistic to the philosophical to the economic.<br />Yet, many of these folks who most loudly proclaim their &quot;Americanism&quot; are the most hostile to ideas which differ from their own rigid, often ill-informed views, seeing any contrary opinion as indicative of aberrant thinking, to the degree that it must be pathological. This hostility to alternative opinions reveals how little these folks truly understand the very society they claim so loudly to love. Their own thinking most closely resembles the mindset of the irrational fanatics who produce repressive regimes in their own lands and who make up the terrorists who bedevil our own.<br />Every outraged, misspelled, badly-written, fact-starved &quot;review&quot; offered here serves as one more admission by these folks that their world-view is intellectually bankrupt and survives only through theirrefusal to see (or say) the truth.<br />Go, Al, Go!

The chapter on Ann Coulter is hilarious.  I don't know much about her except that she's the Head cheerleader of the Right.  Every time I see her on t.v., she always reminds me of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Jar Jar Binks.  Maybe it's the physical resemblance: the long, stiff neck, the doe-like waxen eyes, the big floppy ears or maybe because both are such annoying characters.<BR>The most disturbing and saddest part of the book is Franken's account of the events fallowing Paul Wellstone's memorial service, on how a fifteen second ranting of a distraught best friend was enough ammo for the Rush Rights to trash the presence of 20,000 people who showed up to mourn a painful loss.  It reminds you on how one drop of blood in a whole ocean can get sharks excited and wild about a kill. I think this is pretty much what happened here. How sad that Tucker Carlson didn't even watch the whole memorial service before calling it a &quot;nauseting display.&quot;  I know there's something wrong  when a guy this young and handsome wears a PeeWee bow, maybe  it's depriving his brain of some much needed oxygen. <BR>A guy just plummeted to his death with his wife and four other people.

The people who have written here and given one star refuse to engage Franken on any facts. They can't debate him because Franken is accurate. (Well, the honest reason they can't debate him is undoubtedly that they haven't read the book, but even if they had...)<br />Franken is funny in parts, serious in parts, and (sadly) a bit boring in other parts. Towards the end, he reaches for the golden ring of humor and comes up holding the noose located slightly underneath. It happens, and if you like Franken you forgive him for it. Hey, humor writing isn't easy. <br />As a liberal columnist who isn't as famous as Franken (or as good) I have busted my share of right-wing goons lying. I've caught conservative bozos like Neil Boortz actually changing peoples quotes so he could then attack their newly changed quotes. It's scary and it happens almost every day. The tragedy is - no one cares. If you bust them for a lie, show that they took words out of a quote or added words to one, that they misrepresented facts, or just made stuff up - they just keep lying only with more hostility. Their audience doesn't care. They can tell a hundred lies by the time you have researched and proven one.<br />Conservatives currently control the house, the senate, the Presidency, most governors...  They control much of the media - How much more do they need to make conservatism work? we have the worst economy, are engaged in a war with Iraq - based on the lie of them having weapons of Mass destruction. We are losing our freedoms at an alarming rate chasing invisible terrorists in our public libraries... we are allowing large corporations to pollute at will, we are turning over public resources - owned by everyone - over to an elite few. Our surplus has turned into the largest deficit ever...   At what point in time do we look around and see that the conservative agenda is not working? Do they have to control every judge, every political office, every newspaper? <br />Right now - they lie with impunity and no one except a handful of people dare to question them in public... Because conservatives simply don't care whether or not what they say is the truth.<br />This is the enemy that Franken is up against and although he takes his stab at it - he can barely make a dent in their armor. Yes, conservatives lie and they do it a lot. <br />We on the left scream,&quot;If your cause is so just why must you lie?&quot; <br />The only answer in their silence is that they lie because they have nothing else - because without the lies they are nothing but a movement of fear and hatred exposed. <br />To our dismay on the left, even Al Franken cannot convert the people who believe in the conservative myth. Not with humor or with facts. Most of us liberals simply cannot understand why not, and Franken doesn't attempt to answer that question.<br />At some point in time it comes down to belief. <br />Franken, like most liberals, believes that facts should shed light over fiction. But this is where we liberals most often go wrong. It isn't about truth - it is about beliefs. You must either believe in science (that which can be observed and deduced by man) or believe in mythology (the explanation that God/the Gods make everything happen for some divine reason). It depends on which of these two roads you call &quot;truth&quot;. <br />The more you believe in the &quot;god explanation&quot; - and the more sure you are of your belief - the more conservative you will be.  You have to be conservative to hold on to this type of belief, you must protect it against science - because faith, by definition, is the acceptance of a premise that isn't based in human observation and explanation.<br />The more you believe in science over mythology the more you tend to be liberal. That's why we on the left are attacked as &quot;Godless&quot; because we tend to hold faith at a distance. We don't embrace it as zealously as the right. While many on the left believe in Jesus or some other religious figure- they accept that other beliefs are every bit as valid as their own - because they recognize the fragile nature of faith and belief. <br />There can be no middle ground to the fundamentalist. The world is either black or white - not grey. Godless liberals see grey.<br />Franken, in his book, attacks those extremist beliefs with wit and wisdom. He attacks with facts. He attacks the right-wing fundamentalist Christian god (and the fact he is Jewish is no doubt a reason for their hatred as well)... <br />(This angers Christians because they know God is a republican. He believes in the death penalty, he believes in not taxing the rich. God even believes that it is okay to lie for his cause... )<br />One of the most telling passages is when Franken puts himself in Bill O'Reilly's place after being exposed for saying he won a Peabody Award (he didn't). He wonders why the Fox star didn't just say \\"I'm sorry I said that. Wow. Hey, thanks for pointing that out - that's really embarrassing. I won't say it again...\\"  that, of course, would be the liberal response to an honest mistake, but in the world of Black and White Conservatism - one can never be wrong. <br />O'Reilly instead of apologizing - had Fox attorney's sue Franken's publisher for copyright infringement (he used the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" on his cover - (Fox's lawsuit was literally laughed out of court)) <br />That's why you get hate reviews from people who never read his book. That's why conservatives need to attack him. This is a war and to them there is no middle ground. Franken points out where faith and fact collide. He is their enemy.<br />If you are on the fence as to what to believe in politics - then read this book and at the end ask yourself one of these two questions:<br />1) If the conservative right's cause is so just, why must they lie? - or - <br />2) Why do godless liberals hate America? <br />You won't find these answers in Franken's book, but depending on which question you decide to ask- you will find out where you stand politically (and probably religiously as well).	2003-09-25

I found this to be an extremely funny book at times, obnoxious at times, even a bit mean-spirited at times, but never more so than the right-wing zealots he is railing against. And they're never funny - one wonders if they are filled with so much hate they're no room left for a funny bone...<br />The best thing about this book is that you KNOW Franken is telling the truth. Massive research by 14 Harvard graduate students (despite their politics, at least you have to admit they've got to be pretty smart to be there), backed up by numerous citations which document every lie Franken points out go a long way to convincing those of us who PAY ATTENTION to what's going on in the world that our suspicions as to the lack of honesty in the Bush administration and on Fox News are backed up by the facts.<br />Seeing such a massive conspiracy of lies by the right wing and our senior elected government officials, backed up by so much damning evidence, I can forgive Franken for occasionally being a bit obnoxious and mean. At least his comments are simply a retelling of the facts, don't mind that man behind the curtain trying to tell you otherwise - words on a page. What he is complaining about is a concentrated effort to shift taxes from the mega-rich to the middle-class, eliminating services to the poor in the process, and converting our country from a nation others admire to one they fear and despise. This is not the America I grew up in, it is not the America I want to live in, and it is not the America I want to leave to my children. He is pointing out things which are being done to this country by far-right very rich conservatives (in the name of middle-right, well-off conservatives and the religious right) which significantly affect us and our children for the worse. I think these details need to get out. <br />The right wing doesn't want anybody to know these facts, and you can see their attempts to stop such knowledge even in the mean comments with a 1 star rating they'reusing to try and damage the credibility of this book. Use your head - books don't vary from being excellent to terrible depending on the reader. This is a good book, which those on the right will strongly disagree with. Well, the truth hurts, doesn't it. Doesn't make this a bad book, however.<br />I strongly urge all of those reading this book to also download Paul Krugman's excellent article on the how the Bush administration has conned us on the Tax issue, which can be found at the New York Times with the following details: <br />September 14, 2003<BR>The Tax-Cut Con<BR>By PAUL KRUGMAN	2003-09-25

Franken has taken the political discourse of this great country to a new low as he continues to spew forth unwarranted profanity-laced venomous vitriol - the likes of which our country had not accepted in the past, let alone witnessed.  His conniption fit on Howard Dean's campaign stage was apoplectic at best as he childlishly pilloried Brit Hume with his nonsensical tirade - while Howard Dean looked on admiring the whole chirade.

Unlike the right-wing media plastered on the TV screens in the background, Franken (along with the aptly named &quot;Team Franken&quot;) did his research, meticulously plotting the weak spots in the arguments of Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity (to name a few) and then strategically striking the weak spots, causing the rightist arguments to crumble on their faulty reasoning.<br />Politics aside--well, actually, you can't put the politics aside for this book.  Bottom line, if you're on the left you'll definitely like it, if you're on the right you'll burn it, and if you're on the fence you'll be, at best, ambivalent.  The truth is, Franken is one of America's greatest satirists, blending fact with humor, bias with verbosity.  While the book could have been called &quot;Bill O'Reilly is a Splotchy, Contradictory, Slightly-overweight Hypocrite&quot; it is not; the title merely reflects what you will find between the covers: an exposure of right-wing fallacies.<br />Like I said, your politics will determine the purchase; however, if you can set aside prejudices, read the book.  It is an interesting look at how Fox News and other Right-leaning news organizations color the facts for their own gain--which is not to say that liberals are any less guilty of the crime, though evidence of this is nonexistent in &quot;Lies...&quot;--and how the distortion can make or break a person's public image.<br />That, and he really sticks it to O'Reilly.  That alone is worth the cover price.	2003-09-24

Is it any surprise that Americans are apathetic toward the political process when it's presented like this?

Al Franken was one of the few guys on SNL who was consistently not funny.  He didn't have much of a future as a comedian or actor, so he moved on to his real love, politics.  Now he can make lots of money by writing books with such extreme vitriol and bias that he will always have an audience and plenty of publicity.  (Do you think he pays a little extra in taxes just to protest the Bush tax cuts?)  I suppose when someone agrees with you he seems much more witty and profound.  Let's be honest, there are plently of liars in politics on both sides of the spectrum (gasp) and it wouldn't be too tough to write a book about all the lies of, say, the Clintons - even if you left out the big one - or even FDR, JFK, LBJ, etc.  But then they are Franken's heros so he spares them his righteous scorn.<br /><br />Let's face it, it's tough to be a real liberal nowadays.  Even Bill C. had to stay near the middle.  After the Reagan miracle, the fall of communism and the world-wide shift towards capitalism, there's a sense that what was once right-of-center is a much more reasonable view.  A real defense of liberalism is almost impossible, so the only thing left to do is attack.  And after all, it doesn't take all that much work to find contradictory statements from someone quoted as often as, say, George W.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the left has set itself a trap with Bush, similar to the one with Reagan during Iran-contra.  When you constantly say someone's an idiot, it undermines your subsequent case for him being a mastermind who weaves a web of lies so well that it takes a genius like Al Franken to cut through them all.<br /><br />Oh well, despite Franken's (and much of the media's) best efforts, it's hard to fool all of the people all of the time.  Most people believe Bush simply because he says what he thinks and believes what he says.  While he certainly isn't the most eloquent speaker, he actually is one of the most honest politician around - although admittedly that's faint praise.<br /><br />There is a really profound lie told by the left, however.  That is that we can somehow get to a place where everybody is happy by simply passing a few laws and redistributing wealth (er, not their's, of course).<br /><br />Al, travelling the road to enlightenment begins with a step towards reality.really profound lie told by the left, however.

The \\"reviewer from Connecticut\\"'s comments (code for unilateral libel against Bush) incurred righteous anger in my practical-minded soul. In it, he masks his closet-liberal tendencies, by shamelessly posing as a \\"conservative\\". Yet all his views precisely succumb to the evil scourge that liberalism is, more so than if he was its poster-boy. He derides Bush as \\"having hijacked the Republican Party, with his \\"necon buddies\\", and used it to pursue a completely vicious and destructive extremist agenda, having subverted true conservative principles of protecting civil liberties and practicing fiscal discipline.\\"<br />In light of this uncontrollable extremism on HIS part, WILLFULLY devoid of ANY logical reasoning attributes, I'm now forced to educate him, so to curb the extremism that is all his own, in the way he leaps to conclusion.<br />First of all, neoconservatism isn't a dirty, four-letter word. It seeks to spread American influence the world over, especially on the most barbaric places of the world (the ones the liberals rave over), and is diligent when it comes to putting words into action, by pursuing military actions against countries that won't comply with international mandates, and/or harbor terrorism. Segueing into the Iraq situation, most of the country's peaceful and stable, with the only resistance coming out of the moderately small Sunni Triangle, which is OF COURSE all that one gets force fed, through the liberal media that desperately wants American failure in Iraq, so they can continue to attack Bush for everything short of how the weather's doing. Further, the war was/is OBVIOUSLY legal, do to resolution 1441, years of UN violations on Hussein's part, and the UN's own mandate allowing for preemptive self-defense! <br />Bush's foreign policy is neither vicious OR extremist, seeing as how rationale abides by the fact that action where the terrorists are avoids hundreds of 9/11's, tenfold! Since Syria, Iran and countless other Arab countries are sendingtheir \\"freedom fighters\\" to \\"liberate\\" Iraq from the \\"Great Satan\\", that alone establishes terrorism ties to Iraq. Before any dummy lib resorts to attacking me, I'm not making a connection between Hussein and 9/11, only terminally braindead libs believe that Bush has ever made that connection. <br />Further, \\"Connecticut reviewer\\"'s also slanderous relating to civil liberties. If not for the Patriot Act, 9/11's would be achievable at the will of terrorists-but....I guess that he'd rather like the government NOT to invade his privacy A LITTLE, if that means he can continue to send e-mails to other workers defaming his boss while on the job!!!!!!! Again, the war on terrorism FORCES rulebreaking when it comes to fiscal discipline; as 9/11, corporate scandal, fake jobs in internet companies, recession AND the stock market BUBBLE bursting all contributed to the current debt, which all happened under Clinton's stewardship.<br />BTW, I AM A LIBERAL, and sick AND tired of my party's idiocies!!!!!	2003-09-24

It is important to realize that despite quite sophisticated research, and airtight statistics, Franken does not profess to be a journalist -- only a comedian and self righteously outraged citizen.  Of course, that is the delicious irony of the book -- that a comedian is providing more valid, unvarnished, and intentionally honest facts than the media who are allegedly committed by professional ethics to represent events and facts in a non-partisan, accurate manner.<br />Additionally, Franken makes no bones about the fact that he is partisan.  He takes aim (and achieves numerous bullseyes) calling right wing media as it is -- a mouthpiece for corporate interests, the conservative right, and their political machine the Republican Party.  And he employs the same no gloves tactics that the Republican disinformation sources such as Fox News, the Washington Times, and New York Post do -- he is ruthless and personal, and comes out and actually calls them as they are -- &quot;liars&quot;.  The added irony here is when called on it, the conservative bullies cry fowl, unfair, and unkind -- despite over twenty years of their vicious mendacity, and the resulting squeezing and screwing of the majority of Americans on behalf of a wealthy miniscule minority, and severe damage to our government, society, and culture.<br />This isn't great literature; it isn't an academic study or state of the art journalism -- and Franken doesn't for a moment profess that it is.  However, it is obviously the truth, and it is solace for those many of us who are so discouraged, and feel so disenfranchised by an unrepresentative group of principleless corporate schills running our government and manipulating opinion through dishonest propaganda transmitted through the media outlets that they have created.	2003-09-24

Another review mentioned how obvious it is when people score this a 1 star or a 5 star book based only on their politics.  That was right on the money.  Frankly (no pun intended), if you are a liberal and like these type of books where all that is really covered is how much liberals/conservatives have lied or allegedly damaged this country, then I would buy it.  You can see how Franken's pesonal grudges (specifically with O'Reilly and Hannity) guide the direction of this book.  Many of what Franken considers as lies are probably just mistakes.  His analysis of Hannity's book does show its errors fairly well, but the personal attacks are lame and unneccesary (Franken and Hannity practicallly got into a fistfight at one point in time, these guys really dislike each other).  I can't stand how O'Reilly is (always) considered on the right, considering he criticizes the Bush administration often and holds views that are definitely characteristic of liberal ideology.  Then again, it seems that the only way someone can be considered independent nowadays is if they are socialists or libertarians.  O'Reily agrees with some (more than not I suppose) conservative principles, so he is automatically deemed conservative.  Another thing that ..... me off was how Franken implied that conservatives are much more likely to be racist (I don't have the exact quote, I borrowed a copy), which is about as sterotypical as it gets.  The book does have some funny parts to it nonetheless.  Overall though, it is just another lame pundit-attack-other-pundits book, maybe worth checking out at the libary.  Avoid books like this, Coulter's Slander, and just about every other book by these pundits if you actually want something with an original thesis, idea, or criticism of politics.

Except----wait a sec...---he's also from America!!!!! Goes to show one how much bitter self-hate liberals have-----because they're always looking to succumb to EU opinions.<br />In short: Franken and the libs want to destroy the Republic of America--with its unmatched productivity and greatest earning per head--into a faulty socialist nightmare, exactly like recession-steeped France and Germany. Their woes are partially to blame on their idiotic, socialistic laws, where lazy French and Germans get paid NOT to work, as they're bumming around on beaches!!!!!!!!!<br />Judge this book by those facts. If this is what's in Franken's and liberals' minds: JUST SAY NO TO LEFTISTS.	2003-09-24

I'm sure you too will be convinced, after just a few choice words from the negative reviews:<br />&quot;The reason that Al Franken and Ann Coulter despise each other so, is because they are the same.&quot;  -- You know, I always thought Ann looked like a man!  I think this reviewer discovered the truth about Al, that he's really a female neo-conservative masquerading as a leftist activist and comedian!<br />&quot;If Al Franken had any real political pull in this country, we'd be inviting Bin Laden to a $1000 per head lecture at the base of the Statue of Liberty on why America deserves to be destroyed.&quot;  -- I tried to overlook this one remark in Al's book on page 21, but he does admit it... he hates America.  Why did you have to remind me?  I'm sure he wants America to be destroyed too, even though he would have to move.<br />&quot;That is a bald faced lie [Fair and Balanced] appearing on the very cover of the book.&quot; -- Oh my gosh!  You're right!  And I had mistaken it for satire.  He is such a liar.  The proof is in the pudding.<br />&quot;For every lie in his book by the right, there are hundreds from the left.&quot;  -- I applaud this persons courage in admitting that the right lies.  It troubles me deeply to learn that the left lies 100 times more, however.  I guess the reviewer ran out of room to list more than 0 of the lies from the left though.<br />&quot;This book is so full of Lies that I hope someone will take it on and expose each and every one in another best seller.&quot;  -- I hope so too!

I scoured NexisLexis trying to find problems with Als Book - I found only one small attribution error.  Spinsanity has a review of the book, too found the same error.  <br />I am more of a pragmatic centrist than anything else, and I am really becoming concerned about the polarity with which the right and left seem to be drifting.  The right seems to bo going off into a delusional land where all facts are mutable and all arguments can be won by intimidation and semantic games.  <br />Franken is not lying about what he finds - his notes are well sourced and you can fact check him.  I tried to do the same thing with &quot;Treason&quot; and I found that Ann Coulter really does just make things up.  Sometimes her end note did not even correspond to the noted passage.  Sometimes she claimed that ads or book reviews in the New Yorker were editorial positions of the New York Times.  This is blatantly dishonest.  <br />If the COnservatices think that the best way to defend their ideology is to live ina delusional fantasy land, they are not doing their duty as Americans.  Many of them seem to think that all liberals, all people that check work their for accuracy,  all people who disagree, all people who do not fall in line with every decision that the president makes, all people that express doubts about the reliability or credibility of the president - are all evil, America haters.  Their single-minded zeal and lack of thought about their leadership reminds me of a cult.  I find it frightening.  <br />None of these people know George Bush, the person.  What they see on T.V. is a carefully crafted image.  Everything Bush says has been scripted in advance.  Like any politician, Bush is a P.R. character for the administration.  None of the right wing people know whether or not Bush is honest.  Few know him or anyone who knows him.  They only way to really know Bush is to look at his record.  His record, looks horrible.  <br />The left is not Bush bashing, they are pointing out the obvious facts that the masses on the right seem to be ignoring.  I think we should all think a little more about who we should trust and why.  Setting aside Bush's P.R., his record is not a thing of beauty.	2003-09-23

I thought his Stewart character was hilarious. So I bought the book thinking that I would get some humor mixed in with an intellectual analysis of party politics. I was wrong. Mr. Franken does a great job ripping Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly to pieces (not that it is a difficult task to accomplish this, they are really easy targets). And I give him credit for the hilarious Supply Side Jesus chapter, but the rest of the book is I'm sad to say nothing but a talking points book for the DNC.<br />In the chapter where he is pointing out the &quot;lies&quot; told about Al Gore, he only mentions the Internet gaff and love canal. What Mr. Democrat Franken failed to mention was the many lies that Al Gore told on top of those. Namely, the famous &quot;I've always been pro-choice&quot; lie in the debate with Bill Bradley.<br />He simplifies the reason why the Civil War was fought by saying that the South fought for the right to &quot;continue to whip and beat Blacks&quot; While slavery was certainly one issue with regard to Secession, it was my no means the only one. This was a typical race baiting tactic used by partisans.<br />Then of course the most nauseating is the outright worship of Bill Clinton and the credit the democratic partisians give for a great economy. The people in the workforce that work everyday and don't have a limo and a jet are the ones that make the economy great, not the President of the US (By the way, that goes for Ronald Reagan too.)<br />I could go on and on. But I expected better from Franken than a highly partisan tabloid piece. Instead of looking at important issues fairly and objectively and not through the DNC looking glass (and that goes for the GOP as well with their partisan ways), Al Franken has missed a genuine opportunity to elevate the discussion.	2003-09-23

Besides all of the evidence that Franken presents, the validity of his arguments comes from the fact that we remember the lies he addresses: we know exactly how many and where the WMDs in Iraq are; most of the tax cuts go to the poor and the middle class; massive tax cuts will grow the economy; Bush will bring the country and the world together, Bush is a uniter, Bush will change the tone in Washington; and on and on and on.

I swing toward the left - way toward the left, so I find it insightful, well-researched, true and accurate. Someone who swings the other direction will not find insights, but they'd be hard-pressed to deny the research, and the truth in the facts. GWB is a detriment to our country. O'Reilly needs to put a sock in it and just stop telling lies. You get the gist of it. Now, the people reading this review will either find it helpful (if they are to the left) or not so helpful (if more conservative.) Bottom line is this - whatever political views we hold as true, we can usually find some basis in fact to support us. The problem comes when those facts get twisted and we use them without understanding they have been manipulated. I work hard to throw out liberal chatter and stay true to liberal ideals. So should conservatives. Don't believe all the stuff GWB and Cheney are telling you. Think for yourselves. Stay conservative, but don't turn away from the truth.	2003-09-23

I watched Bowling for Columbine hoping for the same sort of honesty and was disappointed after I checked the facts (as any critical thinker should). But &quot;Lies&quot; transcends propoganda.

First, grow up.  Both the left and the right are neither demons nor saints because they have different opinions.  Neither the left nor the right have a trademark on the truth, both sides have had noble periods and have had their inhumane periods.  Second, why do these reviewers assume I am either left (and with them) or right (and against them)? That's a problem, as a country, we are dividing and we will fall if it continues.  It seems childish to communicate that way.  It sounds close-minded.  I am in the middle.  I cannot blindly side with the left nor the right.  To get a full picture of American thought I need to hear from all sides.  I try not to let bias keep from experiencing open dialog.  I try not to assume I (or my side) is right and has all the answers and the other side just doesn't understand.  Third, instead of being a mouthpiece for your side those reviewers who didn't (some did) give me anything but a cheer for the left give me an argument for why I should bother reading this book with my busy schedule.  I read a few that sounded like this is just another of those bash the other side books liberals and conservatives both put out.  What makes this one worth picking up?

Franken has been somewhat more successful, probably due to his better writing skills and penchant for research, but he is simply extending his comedic routines to highlight some very disturbing facts about the conservative media machine and the Bush administration.  This book isn't serious political discourse, but it is entertaining and enlightening. Fox News and their Neo-Con ilk are basically SNL for conservatives, but the problem I have is that Fox News, Coulter, and Hannity et al hide behind the shield of &quot;journalism&quot; to disseminate fabrications designed to forward a specific political agenda. Franken and his kind don't really pretend to be impartial journalists - they're comedians making fun of politicians.	2003-09-23

I've never had a problem having a good argument with a thoughtful, intelligent conservative.

I'm certain an equally detailed book could be written from the other side, though probably not nearly so laugh evoking.<br />Is this a great piece of investigative journalism, a concentrated exposé, or anything of the sort?  No, and if you wanted that you'd be reading a variety of other lie-busting sources.  Try Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) or other places for leads.<br />Is this book going to convert many people?  I hope not, as converts tend to lack on the skepticism front.  Rather I hope it provokes good-humored skepticism that will help challenge the current administration, as well as those in the future, and the records of those in the past.

My only question is why aren't these facts and blatant Lies by politicians put into more newspapers for mass consumption?  Instead we get J. Lo and Ben, the flavor of the week.

The scales were banging on the left side in a most uneven fashion. I found his diatribes to be far less funny than his Saturday Night live skits. It was a total waste of time and money. I'll never buy anything written by him in the future.&quot;<br />Did this reviewer think we would sympathize at the waste of time and money that resulted when they didn't get a &quot;fair and balanced&quot; analysis of the right? How could anyone miss the subtitle's sarcasm? It's not like Al Franken has made a big secret of his political beliefs. If you hate his liberal view point so much, what are you doing buying his book in the first place? That's like buying Ann Coulter's &quot;Treason&quot; and being upset that it is a right-wing zealot's historical revisionism. What else do you expect? <br />Calm down people.

Unfortunately, if there's one problem that I have with this book, other than a few jokes that fall flat, it's the name-calling that Franken himself does.  I will admit to feeling some glee when Franken calls Ann Coulter a nutcase (which may or may not be true) and Bill O'Reilly a bully and a liar (which definitely is true), but I still long for the return of truly civil public debate in this country.<br />Until then, I will content myself with enjoying the efforts of folks like Franken, who hoist self-aggrandizing right wingers on their own petards.

Last night on NBC Dateline, Bill O'Reilly was interviewed about subjects various and sundry, including Franken's book. He accused Franken of lying about him, but when asked, he wouldn't specify the lies, saying, merely, &quot;I'm not going to get into that.&quot; You'd think a person who has been wronged--been lied about,allegedly--would take the opportunity on national tv to put the record straight and expose his accuser as being the lying one. No go. I know what conclusion I draw from that...what about you?<br />Then, O'Reilly proceeded to repeat one of his lies exposed by Franken in his book, saying he had grown up in the &quot;Westbury section of Levittown,&quot; (sic). Well, I went to a map of Long Island, and Westbury and Levittown are MILES apart from each other! O'Reilly used the example of a resident of Queens saying he's from Jackson Heights. Well, as we NYC residents know, Jackson Heights is a subsection of the BOROUGH of Queens. The analogy doesn't apply at all to Westbury or Levittown. I think Franken in the book says it would be like someone saying they grew up in the Brooklyn section of Manhattan. (Brooklyn and Manhattan are both boroughs of New York City, but they are distinct geographical entities. Westbury and Levittown are both towns in Long Island, but they are quite distinct geographical entities, much farther apart than Brooklyn and Manhattan.)<br />You'd think O'Reilly would have been smart enough to refuse comment on anything having to do with Franken's book; in the end, he only makes himself look more deceitful...and foolish, to boot!	2003-09-22

But I just thought that the right-leaning media was getting away with it. <BR>Through a plethora of DOCUMENTED exposs Al Franken (an unrepentant left-winger) shows readers exactly what the right media is doing, and why they're getting away with it.<BR>To begin with, you cannot overlook Franken's funny, sardonic, witty writing style. However, he knows when to be serious so as not to undermine his research work.<BR>On to the substance! He first starts by debunking Ann Coulter, who I always thought was a very sneaky, half-wit, over-hyped liar. He shows how she hides information from the readers. How she takes quotes completely out of context and how she mis-construdes statements. Even some of her sources are utterly baffled at the mis-representation of the facts.<BR>Then to O'Reily whom I've always thought was a moron with a tele prompter. He's so flagrant in his right-wing agenda, and so arrogant about his &quot;fair and balanced&quot; views, that he's actually a pretty easy target. Now, onto an even easier target. Sean Hannity. This guy, you've got to give him credit. I don't how he made it into main-stream TV. If you think O'Reily is arrogant, well this guy is much more so, but with nothing to brag about. He's right-out DUMB! Yet he claims to have a much deeper understanding of the underlying ethereal ways our world works--Give me a break! He would not know how much is 1+1 even if he tried.<BR>And Franken goes on with a multitude of very revealing, and starking facts about the so-called &quot;fair and balanced.&quot; <BR>As an independent-minded and skeptical person, I can tell you that this book is one of Franken's better ones. Yes he gives his left-leaning views, yet you could read the book, skim off the political ideology statements and still be a good book.<BR>I highly recommend it... For what it's worth!	2003-09-22

I particulary enjoyed the chapter &quot;Ann Coulter: Nutcase&quot; in which Franken shows repeatedly how many times she misrepresented something or just flat out lied in her book &quot;Slander&quot;.  The right-wing will hate this book and label it &quot;whiny&quot;, say that liberals are just &quot;bashing&quot; the right-wing, will write 1 star reviews without having read the book to dissuade people from buying it.  But through all this, there is one glaring fact:  they cannot dispute anything Franken writes in this book.  He dispels the myth of the so-called &quot;liberal media&quot; and shows how the right-wing repeatedly counts on the American people to believe anything they say as long as they repeat it often enough, even if it's an out-and-out lie.  Every example Franken uses in this book is well-documented and researched.  He says it himself -- the difference between his book and Ann Coulter's, Sean Hannity's, et al, is that he's been able to do something the right-wing can't:  get the facts straight!	2003-09-22

That being said, this is a good book.  Franken does not pull many punches, and takes more than a little glee in pointing out the gaffes that the right wing seems to make again and again.  <br />The best parts of this book are him dealing with O'Reilly, Coulter, and Hannity.  His description of the encounters with O'Reilly honestly had me laughing out loud.  Also great is his chapter about Hannity and Colmes (and all of the Fox News crew).  Probably my least favorite part was the at times monotonous repitition that the media is not all liberal.  Franken goes on for a long time proving this point, and I felt that he made his point in one or two chapters, he didn't need six or seven.<br />I gave this book 4 stars; Good, not great.  Good, worth buying in hardback, but not as good as Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot.  It is funny, he does back up his claims with evidence, but in some parts you're just wishing he'd get back to some of his hilarious stories.	2003-09-22

I have been impatiently waiting for a clear democratic voice to come out of the shadows and say something interesting regarding the right-wing shift that has held this country hostage in the years since 9/11.  It is about time a talented writer like Mr. Franken comes along and honestly and directly approach the misinformation and, well, LIES of the conservative movement.  There has never been a &quot;liberal media,&quot; but there is obviously a large and well-funded conservative media working 24/7 in print and on television.  This book addresses the distortions that the right-wing comes up with on a daily basis. It is also funny, full of heart, and best of all: it may just wake up a few democrats who have been hibernating for the last three years.

Truly, this is one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. I have always been a conservative and still remain one to this day. No, I'm not. Yes, I am. I am not lying. <br />Much of what is said in this book should be taken tongue-in-cheek. And I do not see all the stories Mr. Franken presents in exactly the same light as he does, though I enjoyed reading his version of them. For example, his defense of Al Gore's statement that he took the initiative in creating the Internet is unsustainable. I wrote a book about the rise of the Internet and, considered literally, Mr. Franken's defense of Al Gore does not quite stand up to objective analysis. However, he makes a good point about Al Gore's exaggerations being blown out of proportion by the supposedly liberal media, when more serious exaggerations by right-wing politicians are often left unexamined.<br />I also do not believe that ad hominem attacks is a way to counteract ad hominem attacks, because if one accepts this strategy, one becomes no better than the person who initiates name-calling. This is why I think that, while Mr. Al Franken had come up with a humorous title for a book on Rush Limbaugh (he defends the title in this book; that's why I am bringing this up in this review), his own ad hominem, however humorously intended, is not more elevated than Limbaugh's ad hominem, even if Mr. Limbaugh did use an ad hominem &quot;first&quot; against some callers and politicians he did not like.<br />Then there is also an issue of politics not being about power, but about improving people's lives. C'mon. Is this seriously intended? To be honest, I do not know, since Al has a tendency to kid around so much. But I think he really did mean this. Of course, politics is all about power. However, I admire Mr. Franken's outgoing personality and his ability to connect with celebrities and mere mortals alike.<br />The stories about O'Reilly's saga of Peabody vs. Polk, Hannity and Colmes, and a visit to Bob Jones University are hilarious. They alone are worth the price of the book. <br />In the end, why do I recommend that you buy this book? Because it is good enough, it is smart enough, and doggone it, I like it!	2003-09-22

I find it interesting that no one seems to disagree with the CONTENT of this book; instead they simply express dislike for it's author and its conclusions. Here's a tip kids: if you disagree with an argument and consider it to be flase, it makes little sense to simply say \\"I dislike the conclusion offered.\\" If you wish to make a point, you must undermine the premises upon which the argument s based.<br />Most fairly bright people with a decent sense of humor/ability to detect sarcasm will find this book at least moderately amusing.

Franken does to the Right wing's &quot;media echo chamber&quot; what Michael Moore does to greedy corporations, gun lovers, and corrupt politicians. He tears holes (or just rips open the existing ones) in books by Ann Coulter and Bernard Goldberg (no relation, thank God). Most of the humor stems not from Franken's wit (which is not to be discounted), but from the people whose lies he exposes. Only you don't want to laugh with them, you want to laugh at them, and at the public who eat up their rants (actually, it's not really funny at all that the Fox crew is poisoning the minds of readers across the country with their hate and lies...) The one thing missing from this book is the motivational stuff that Moore puts in his books to get people politically active.

One reviewer claimed that &quot;If lying is the issue, a far richer target would be the left.&quot;  Funny how this person deflects while offering nothing to back up his claims--a tactic often used by those, on the left as well as the right, who can't support their argument.  Another reviewer claims all democrats are socialists, a sweeping generalization that one with even the slightest bit of common sense can debunk, and then goes on to say, in so many words, if one is not a conservative who agrees with and blindly supports the &quot;President&quot; (the only President in history who didn't get the most votes, by the way--if the tables were turned, you can bet the right would be crying foul, and, yes, the left would probably keep their mouths shut), he/she is then a member of a collective &quot;Don't Support the Troops&quot; party.  This person brings up the fact that troops are dying in Iraq, failing to note that it was his precious President who sent them there in the first place.And besides, it is possible to support the troops without supporting the war or the President's foreign policy.  Let me explain: one can appreciate and be proud of the military men and women who risk their lives in a cause they believe in (ostensibly, though they didn't really have a choice in the matter if they signed up pre-Iraq Occupation), who truly believe freedom is under attack and they must protect it, even if we don't happen to agree with them.  Intention goes a long way, and I for one could not be prouder of our fighting men and women, despite the fact that I think our &quot;Commander-in-Chief&quot; sent them to die for reasons other than weapons of mass destruction (no proof whatsoever with Iraq, unlike with North Korea, who have even threatened us--but Saddam is the greater enemy?), or 9/11 connections (no proof there either, but you know who does have a proven 9/11 connection?--Osama bin Laden!  That's right, and yet we seem to have forgotten all about him), and the &quot;liberation&quot; of the Iraqi people (even as we flaunt our close ties to countries that oppress their people, we claim we're in Iraq partly because of Saddam's atrocities, a baldfaced lie--again, intention goes a long way). But I digress.  Anyway, the book is excellent, and shows Hannity, O'Reilly, Coulter and many others--who specialize and have made a career off of sweeping generalizations--for who they truly are--mere shells who spout values and mindless rhetoric without the slightest moral commitment to their claims and without the slightest ethical commitment to their followers.	2003-09-22

In late August lawyers for Fox News tried to make Al Franken's publisher remove the words \\"fair and balanced,\\" and a photo of Bill O'Reilly with what looks like a nasty case of rosacea, from the cover of what to many people is probably a vile, disgusting, and dangerously inflammatory book.  \\"Franken is neither a journalist nor a television news personality,\\" Fox told the court.  \\"He is not a well-respected voice in American politics; rather, he appears to be shrill and unstable. His views lack any serious depth or insight.\\"<br />     As spectators tittered, guffawed, chuckled, chortled, and giggled, adding a whole new dimension to the expression \\"laughed out of court,\\" U. S. District Judge Denny Chin methodically shredded Fox's arguments, calling them \\"wholly without merit, both factually and legally.\\"  Franken thanked Fox \\"for filing one of the stupidest briefs I've ever seen in my life.\\" <br />     Since then, it's been all down hill for Fox News, which predictably decided to quietly withdraw its suit, not to report its courtroom debacle and let you decide how far its lawyers went to make fools out of themselves.  Franken, on the other hand, is living well and trolling for a Pulitzer.  <br />     As the author points out, this is a work that \\"brings to a new level the politics of personal destruction that have come to define our era.\\"  Franken decided that the entertainment value of right-wing politicians and conservative media personalities comes from their willingness to lie and distort.  So, with the help of a volunteer research team of 14 Harvard students, he assembled an encyclopedic catalog of the right's underhanded accusations, devious innuendo, factual misstatements, and blatant distortions of the truth.  The result makes a compelling case that right-wing media icons are sleazy, intellectually dishonest, and willing to sink to any depths to promote themselves and advance their careers.  Maybe that's a little harsh.  It's probably more correct to say thatFranken makes a compelling case that they're a bunch of liars.  Yeah, that's better.<br />     Unfortunately, some of this book is just gratuitously cruel.  For example, when Franken lifts a sizzling sex scene from Bill O'Reilly's weirdly kinky suspense thriller \\"Those Who Trespass,\\" and uses it three different times simply to mock its author and make him appear ridiculous and absurd, it seems like piling on.  But you'll never watch Bill O'Reilly again without thinking of the phrase \\"brief white panties.\\"  Try it.  I dare you.<br />     Unless you're familiar with concepts like \\"parody\\" and \\"satire,\\" and can quickly spot examples, a lot of this stuff will probably sail right over your head.  This might be what happened to Fox's lawyers.  Or maybe it was just the money.  Anyway, if you're a far right-wing conservative Republican, you will despise this book.  You will want to give it less than one star, warn people not to waste their money, and say that you tore it up and threw it in the garbage after reading the first four pages.  Don't do this to yourself.<br />     If you're anybody else, you will laugh, and laugh, and laugh, because this book is very, very funny.	2003-09-22

Kennedy School of Government says it is \\"dedicated to exploring the intersection of press, politics and public policy in theory and practice.\\" It chose the sometime comedian to be one of its Shorenstein Fellows for Spring 2003. <br />An effusive press release announced that Franken would be \\"working on a book examining whether or not there is a liberal bias in the media, including a look at the media's treatment of George W. Bush and his administration.\\"<br />Now we have the results of Franken's work in his new book, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.<br />In it, Franken attacks lots of people: Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, George W. Bush and even Alan Colmes, the liberal half of Fox News's \\"Hannity and Colmes,\\" who Franken believes lacks the gumption to stand up to conservative counterpart Sean Hannity.<br />The book has such chapter titles as \\"Ann Coulter: Nutcase,\\" \\"Bill O'Reilly: Lying, Splotchy Bully\\" and \\"I Attend the White House Correspondents Dinner and Annoy Karl Rove, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, and the Entire Fox News Team.\\"<br />It's filled with comedic touches. For example, Franken refers to the Fox talk-show team as \\"Hannity and Colmes,\\" with the small type used to illustrate Colmes's supposed wimpiness.<br />But a question arises: Does Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them measure up to the high academic standards of Harvard's Shorenstein Center?<br />Yes, said Alex Jones, the former New York Times reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner who is now the center's director. <br />\\"I would not have allowed a book that I consider frivolous,\\" Jones explained. \\"What Al Franken had in mind was a serious book. It has a skin of humor, but it is a thoroughly researched book.\\"<br />Jones added that Franken, whose previous works include Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot, Oh, the Things I Know! A Guide to Success, or, Failing That, Happiness and I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me! is \\"a political satirist, not just a guy who does schtick.\\"<br />\\"I take him seriously,\\" Jones said.<br />For his new book, Franken put together a team of 14 Harvard research assistants. <br />\\"He recruited them on his own,\\" Jones is quick to point out. \\"They were not paid by us and did not receive any credit.\\"<br />Franken called his group \\"TeamFranken\\" and gave the assistants special TeamFranken T-shirts. Dressed and ready, they set to work uncovering the lies of the right.<br />For example, Franken states flatly that George W. Bush, in his younger days, used cocaine.<br />Who knows? Maybe he did. But Franken has no evidence. And he certainly knows that during the 2000 campaign, reporters from major news organizations spent many hours searching - unsuccessfully - for proof of Bush drug use. <br />But who cares? Bush is a lying liar, right?<br />And not just about drugs. About more important things, too - such as taxes.<br />You know the old argument about the president's tax cut: Democrats say more money went to upper-income taxpayers, Republicans say lower-income taxpayers received proportionally bigger cuts.<br />Both are correct, but Franken settles it by simply pronouncing the Republicans lying liars.<br />He does so on the basis of the kind of \\"thorough\\" TeamFranken research that so impressed Jones - in this case, apparently reading press handouts from left-leaning advocacy groups.<br />For example, a May 26, 2001, press release from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, citing research by the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, said, \\"The bottom 60 percent of the population would receive 14.7 percent of the tax cuts.\\"<BR>Franken writes of the tax cuts, \\"The truth is that the bottom 60 percent got 14.7 percent.\\" Did it really take a gaggle of research assistants to come up with that?<br />There's more along thoselines, accusing Bush and the Republicans of lying about Iraq, education and the environment - pretty much everything.<br />And Republicans are not just lying liars. They are very bad people. For example, Franken is angry about racism, which he associates almost exclusively with the GOP.<br />He writes that when he gives corporate speeches, he begins by saying, \\"Looking out at your faces today, I can see that this group hasn't caved in to that whole affirmative action nonsense.\\" <br />He says audiences \\"look around, see all the white faces, and laugh.\\"<br />The funny thing is, one could say the same at a meeting of TeamFranken. Judging by a photo published at the end of the book, it appears that Franken's crew has no African-American members. TeamFranken, made up of a grossly disproportionate number of white males, does not look like America.<br />That small, hypocritical note wouldn't matter much were Franken not throwing so many stones. But he is - from the glass house built for him by the Shorenstein Center.	2003-09-22

His writing is not necessarily compelling and the reality is this book is probably not going to change anyone's political stances. Human nature is such that it just does not happen very often that a person's politics are going to suddenly turn upon reading a book by a person who they view as being a part of the opposition.<br />Regardless, it is still a fun read, particularly in its expose of Bill O'Reilley, which isn't necessarily all that damning. Of course, O'Reilley became incensed that anyone investigated claims regarding his background and he turned what should have been relatively minor problems into a spin control problem.<br />Heck, O'Reilley's own mother has confirmed that he didn't live in the bad area of town that he tries to claim. Yet O'Reilley is bound and determined to make everyone believe he grew up on the wrong side of the tracks.<br />Apparently conservatives, lacking any dirt on Franken (Franken pretty much has admitted to all of his past without embellishment and even apologized for tricking John Ashcroft), decide to attack this book accusing Franken of not looking at the liars on the left, whining, and God knows what else. <br />Fox News was so incredibly stupid as to sue him, probably fueling more sales of the book. And their attacks demonstrate an underlying point of the book: conservatives and Republicans lost their sense of humor somewhere along the way. Why is it that so many conservative types are pompous blowhards?<br />All politicans and political commentators hate having the microscope turned on them and Franken does so here, to often hilarious results. Look for more attacks by the humorless on Franken in the near future.	2003-09-22

He is simply using what other people have said to show what were the truth lies, no pun intended. It is no different than a book by  Bill O'Riley or any other person who is of the right. <br />I really must wonder why most people are so serious and must rip into everything.

That seems to happen no matter what the news is, 9/11, 2000 election, invasion of Iraq, etc.  It is this phenomenon that I would like to see Franken explore in his next book. It could be very enlightening, funny, and more useful than characterizing the other side as idiots and liars.

It is the funniest book out there since The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.  Franken rescues American satire from the diluted depths of weak Saturday Night Live skits and tight-arsed political cartoonists with this scathing attack on Far Right media's fabrications and the mainstream media who parrot them.  This is the true face of comedy in its unabashed Juvenailian form.<br />As with Rush Limbaugh Is A Big, Fat Idiot, Franken reduces the rants of conservative pundits to their natural absurdity by using meticulous research against their own statements.  He is also a charming, provocative raconteur who lampoons himself along with his targets.  Don't expect to catch the likes of Hannity, Coulter, or O'Reily doing that any time soon.<br />Franken fills Lies and the Lying Liars with abundant, side-splitting goodies, such as practical jokes (a visit to Bob Jones University and a letter to Ashcroft and other prominent conservatives, requesting their juvenille just-say-no stories), nasty parodies of Bill O'Reily's pornographic mystery pulp, and a scabrous little piece of fantasy fiction about what would have happened if blowhard conservatives Limbaugh, Buchanan, Dubya, and O'Reily couldn't weasel out of military service in Viet Nam.  <br />Finally, the comically adopted tone of righteous indignation in this book trumps the radical Right commentators at their own game, and it is not surprising to see the National Review's book critic bemoaning Franken's latest victory over them.  <br />Bravo, Al!	2003-09-21

If so, you would be wrong. The problem with Al's book is that he provides sources for his statements, references for what he says and explains clearly HOW he came to his conclusions. He explains how Ann Coulter used LEXUS/NEXUS to distort the truth. He cited his sources instead of &quot;a friend of mine's wife's cousin&quot;, etc.<BR>This book won't make me a Democrat, only make me more aware of why I need to vote for more worthy candidates, no matter what their party affiliations may be. <BR>Frankin does offer opinions and some unsubstantiated or poorly substantiated &quot;facts&quot;, but not nearly as many as a Rush Limbaugh or other far right winged commentators have. Most importantly, it substantiates many of the rumors I had been hearing for a number of years now by citing actual sources of these statements. Now if I say something, I can cite real sources instead of &quot;I heard or read such and such&quot; on the Internet the other day.<BR>For those who denigrate this book by saying that it is a bunch of lies, please cite ONE SINGLE LIE that you have found in this book, along with YOUR source proving that it is a lie.<BR>I have read dozens of reviews saying he has written a pack of lies but not a single citation of a lie they have found in the book. <BR>Al proved that Bill O'Reilly lied about his Peabody awards. He proved that O'Reilly was not from a &quot;poor&quot; family and worked his way up to his $4 million a year job, but rather grew up in an affluent suburb of NY and went to private schools. He proved he was a registered Republican (no sin) and not an Independent as he has claimed constantly.<BR>So I await someone citing even one lie in this book, let alone that the whole book is nothing but lies. I am sure there are some facts that are wrong, but so far nobody has pointed out a single one yet.<BR>The negative points I have about this book are:<BR>1) It rambles a bit too much and has too little detail on some points and too much on others.<BR>2) It mirrors right wing dogma in that it sees no good in people on the right and no bad in people on the left. Both sides have good and bad and it reduces the impact of the book to paint with too broad of a brush.<BR>3) It spends too much time on meaningless people like Coulter, O'Reilly and Hannity and not enough on those who really impact our lives like Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft and the rest of the Bush cabinet.	2003-09-21

Can anyone say Straw Man?  I knew you could.<br />Here's the thing, when Franken is picking apart the lies of people like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity, he does really well.  he had a bunch of great fact checkers and researchers.  it's not hard to prove these people are lying because the truth is out there for people to find.  <br />The only issue I have with Franken is that he's a die-hard Clintonite.  and while I am on the liberal side of the equation, I know that Bill is not a god, that he made many mistakes and did his own lying.  But it is the way of books such as these to adhere to one side of an issue, no matter what is really going on on that side.	2003-09-21

As if we needed another book to reinforce the contempt partisans hold for each other. Admittedly, the book is funny.

Of course, Franken can get away with his brand of vitriol by labeling it &quot;sarcasm,&quot; &quot;analysis&quot; or &quot;satire.&quot; But, the impact on public discourse is the same - it further polarizes ideologues and turns the majority of moderate Americans off.	2003-09-21

Franken coats it all with some great humor but also exposes the lies with good hard facts.  He catches the administration  and their cohorts in several mistruths and lies by using fact finders to expose them with none other than their FACTS.  These lies are not about their sextual endevors but about things that effect our, (you and me) everyday lives. For example 9/11, Clinton and his staff had set up an elaborate antiterrorism plan including evidence that Osama bin Laden would attack using planes that was passed to the Bush administration and ignored.  Both Bush and Cheney were great benefactors (millions)of inside trading just like the type that they scolded Enron execs for.  Also the many lies were refuted from the likes of Coulter, Hannity and O'Reilly.  I would like to see a republican refute this book with evidence that proves that these statements are untrue instead of expecting us to just believe them when they say that they are lies.  Please don't just say that they are using \\"fuzzy math\\" and expect that to convince us.	2003-09-21

Second, the negative reviews that I read were generally short, unsophisticated, childish defenses of the nearly deified President Bush and his party.  I have not been able to corroborate the clarifications Franken makes in the book, but they do reek of authenticity.  The strongest argument for the book's authenticity is that there has been no high profile discrediting by those critized.<br />The critics of the book and those that seem to blindly support the conservatives will some day learn that they are but &quot;political cannon fodder&quot; for an agenda that cuts them out of the profits.  It is the people in the heartland of American that are the strongest supporters of the Conservative agenda, but that benefit the least.  It is those people that stand in the unemployment lines and have seen their retirment plans vanish that the Conservatives have duped into giving their support.  <br />Not to worry though.  There is zero chance that Bush will be reelected in part because of Franken's book, but more because he will lose the popular vote by a large margin.  Almost all of those that voted for him because they were mad at Clinton will vote for the opposition.	2003-09-21

I double checked a number of things he's pointed out - such as Hannity's mischaracterization of the Reagan vs Democratic Congressional budgets. They are absolutely true, and he does the best he can to show where the radical right is lying.<br />In the end, the growing right wing radicalism in this nation at present will destroy itself if it keeps on the current path.<br />Great job, Al!

After eight years of good times, financial abundance, and awesome growth, we are now in a state of contraction.  It seems the minute Bush took office, things went bad, like there's a dark cloud over this country that's not lifting.  I fear the future of this country is in jeopardy.  <br />I listened recently to two men talking politics:  one pointed out that Bush is in office to reward his billionaire buddies and that he's no one's friend but theirs (and he presented facts to prove it); that he's taken our surplus and made it into a huge deficit; that he knew about 9.11 before it happened, but did nothing because it would give him a chance to extract revenge on the middle eastern oil guys he had a personal vendetta against; that he has the media in his tight little fist because he threatens to ban any of them from the White House who don't agree with him.  The other man, a staunch Bush man, didn't refute anything he heard with facts.  All he could say was, &quot;Well, what about Clinton?&quot;  How many people who blindly support Bush use that seeming standard line when they can't handle the truth of what they're hearing?<br />Al Franken has opened my eyes to hatemongers I didn't even know existed, although I've seen that raving maniac, Bill O'Reilly, when I've been flipping through the channels.  Seems I could never leave his foul mug on my tv screen very long without discomfort and now I know why...he a lying liar! <br />To the Republican reviewer that enjoyed Franken's book but would have liked information on more relevant people like Bush, Cheney, and Ashcroft...I refer you to a phenomenal book called &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; by an author named Hatfield.  He gives a straightforward account of Bush's background, business affiliations, and voting policies when he was governor of Texas.  You even grow to like the young Bush...but something happens to him as he matures.  He becomes a &quot;hit&quot; man for his wimpish father in the White House...in addition, he's in charge of the dirty tricks of his father's campaign...and carries them through with venom.  He threatens anyone who doesn't support his father and follows up on his threats.  He never forgets what he considers a transgression (simply someone who may have an opposing viewpoint).  Read &quot;Fortunate Son.&quot;  It's an eye opener.  <br />Thank you, Al Franken, for your brave expose of the yellow media that's got this country hoodwinked.  Their propaganda is reminiscent of how communist countries distort the truth to retain control.  Big bucks buy power...and power corrupts (see example of greedmeister, Ruppert Murdock).  I can only pray that enough people read this book and galvanize to make sure Bush doesn't make it a second term.  Otherwise, we might not survive as a nation!	2003-09-21

I was a Thatcherite who herself inspired Reagan. I have been here for fifteen years and have grown more disgusted by the political process and general lack of voter awareness.<br />I listen to alot of right wing radio, what choice do I have - the alternative is bland music or all day sport. I read quite alot and I have read AL Franken's latest book. Not great literature, not great comedy (quite funny)- but very interesting. The funniest line was the last line.<br />When I read a book like this - I want to make sure that that the extremely serious accusations are correct. So I decide to do some research. If I want to find about about a movie I go to Rotten Tomatoes. For a book what better than than Amazon and the 1100 reviews to date.<br />Since I am looking for faults in the book - I focus on reviews that give it one or two stars. It is these people that will determine whether this book is accurate or not. Remember, this is a top selling book which is accusing the President of the USA of being a lyar!!!<br />I will now list the typical one star rebuttals with my comments were appropriate:<br />1) &quot;Unsubstantiated&quot; - May be but give me an example!<BR>2) &quot;His arguments can be dismantled in Five minutes&quot; I'm listening<BR>3)&quot;Liberals will follow the fate of James Dean....&quot; Is this a threat or a pagan vision?<BR>4) &quot;He must be a Frenchman&quot; In your dreams (Since French people have 4-6 weeks vacation a year, enjoy long lunches with excellent wine, can wander through streets with beautiful architecture, have affordable health care, job security and very little poverty. His American counterpart is lucky to get 2 weeks vacation, works like a dog, eats processed meat from factory farms without proper hygene and worker safety/benefits, and were there a good chance he lives below the poverty level having had a comparatively poor education, and his future probably means he will lose his manufacturing job in exchange for a job at K-Mart)<BR>5)&quot;Liberalism is basically Secularism&quot;. No comment<BR>6)&quot;8 months prior to Sept 11, is the Clinton adminstration  Duh !!!&quot; Three people thought that was good review.<BR>7) &quot;I have not read this book...&quot; 8 out 77 thought that was good review.<BR>8) &quot; If he wanted to prove his case he should challenge them directly&quot; This book is a direct challenge. I am looking for factual rebuttals.<BR>9) &quot;He should get a job&quot; This is too deep for me.<br />So the critics have had their say. The above list is merely a representative sample. So far all responses have been vacuous. <br />Thus the conclusion that Bush (and his cronies) is a lyar. During the election campaign I had come to the conclusion that if you had to wade through Bush's deepest thoughts you would not even get your ankles wet. But it is obvioulsly worse than that. He has made huge lies regarding the miltary, his tax policy and Iraq. His every statement regarding the environment is a gaping deception. I'm not particuarly religious, but if you plan on getting votes by aligning yourself with God, you had dam well better be virtuous. Understanding the Gospel according to Luke also might help.<br />Many people who are upset by this callous, hypocritical administartion are accused of a lack of patriotism. Well it is not patriotic to destroy the land air and water that we breath. It is not patriotic to increase poverty or to execute innocent people or execute people who merely get legal aid. It is not patriotic a launch a war having decieved the electorate, it is not patriotic to use religion to get votes, use religion to destroy Science and Logic, to use religion to carry out a pagan foreign policy. It is not patriotic to treat the rest of the world with contempt, to help fund the educational infrastructure that breeds people who dream of destroying America. It is not patriotic to lie. No that is not patriotism. but it does threaten the longterm security of me, my family and all who want a happy healthy and prosperous longterm future.<br />Ignorance may be bliss - but it is also highly dangerous. <br />Bush's crimes listed in this book are worse than Clintons (i.e the politically inspired investigation into his private life, that paralized the country for a year and led to issues that should reside between husband and wife, not a with a bunch of adulterous political enemies) or Nixons relatively minor crime.<br />With hindsight and without the promised ('we know where they are')weapons of mass destruction, the war on Iraq was obviously illegal. Impeachment should be in the air.	2003-09-21

As you can see...90% of the reviews are by the party faithful...the ultra rights and lefts.  However, those extremists make up 10% of the real American public opinion.  The majority of Americans have centrist viewpoints.  This review is for you.  This book, love it or hate it, has incontrovertible evidence that, yes, these people lied.  Now, it's up to you as to whether or not you want to read a mildly humorous book that points these lies out with hard facts...photo copies in some cases.  The lies are obvious in most cases and Machiavellian in others, but after reading this book you will indeed know that, yes, these people flat out lied ('you' being the majority...the extremist minority will not change their opinions or reviews).  Democrats, on the whole, are no better than the GOP and both parties are good at lying, but Franken does a good partisan job of pointing out the lies the GOP has been producing for quite some time.  The same `uncovering' could easily be done by someone from the right, but it would be a completely humorless attempt.  That is why I recommend this book to all of you out there in the middle...although partisan, it is factual and entertaining and in some cases funny.	2003-09-20

Confronted with viewpoints more appropriate for the enemies of democracy (E.g., &quot;Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power&quot; - Mussolini), Franken fights back the way he does best, with his unique style of fact-based satire.  <br />Franken's humor educates and evidences that the blustering spins, lies, and propaganda from the menagerie of corporate shills and swills on the right can be as funny as they are wrong.  E.g., Al shows us that the military bravery of the &quot;chickenhawks&quot; on the right is limited primarily to that of sacrificing others - and that the religion formerly known as Christianity, what Al lampoons with his &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot;, the Jesus embraced by the right, has nothing to do with the Jesus portrayed in the Bible.  <br />The only thing funnier than Al's book is Fox's hillarious failure to censor it with a frivolous lawsuit.  How does that old saying go?  &quot;Trying times do unlikely heros make?&quot;  <BR>Laugh, then be inspired by this remarkable and brave comedian/freedom fighter.	2003-09-20

I confess I am a liberal and have contributed to Emily's List for the past 6 years. I am a liberal because I am in the health care profession working with children and families, and I see first hand what comes of Republican policies. Therefore, Al Franken's book is right up my alley. I have not followed politics that closely in recent years, because it usually sickens me, but it was very interesting to read Mr. Franken's take on recent political tempests in teapots, such as the Paul Wellstone memorial. I particularly enjoyed the fact that Mr. Franken goes right to the source. He calls up the media or political figure that has lied about something, and confronts them with the lie, giving them the chance to respond appropriately. How sad that so few of them took responsibility for their lies once they were caught. I recommend this book to citizens of all belief systems: to conservatives, because they should think about getting their people to at least lie better and get some of their facts straight; to liberals, who hopefully will be galvanized into action surrounding upcoming elections and do what it takes to make America the compassionate leader it can and should be; and to the undecided, because it may help them decide and galvanize them to take more part in the political process themselves. Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them is a fast, thought-provoking, and funny, funny read. You go, Al!	2003-09-20

If there had been an opportunity to dispute Al Franken, those who are spit-roasted here would have squealed &quot;liar&quot; in return by now (successfully -- sorry, Bill). <br />Unfortunately, Al and TeamFranken have their number (or rather, numbers). Since both the targets and their audiences cheerfully ignore facts and fact-bearers that's not really the issue, though. Nope, it's the TONE that's so troublesome for them. Franken adopts their own rabid mannerisms to refute them, with two important differences: Franken's retorts are 1) truthful and 2) howlingly funny (for the most part). <br />This book exposes all the mechanisms that neo-con shills use to mask the truth. The Orwellian perversion of: Ann Coulter's &quot;footnotes&quot; (and appalling quotes of quotes -- a new editorial low); Sean Hannity's tables; Bill O'Reilly's fast-and-loose &quot;Peabodys&quot; and voter registration; etc. are exposed for what they are. Franken's particular genius is to force the methods used by these liars into logical short-circuits that readers can see for themselves. And no, these are not &quot;minor errors.&quot; No one on the left would ever be allowed to get away with the nonsense these &quot;journalists&quot; have. <br />While exposing the mouthpieces Franken doesn't neglect an administration that uses the same nasty methods as well. What's the most repulsive? Karl Rove's push polling? The smearing of the Wellstone memorial? Many telling anecdotes, but nothing tops the whole &quot;Operation Ignore&quot; for this New Yorker. <br />Other highlights? Too many for a meaningful list. So to be fair (that word again), here's the stuff that in my opinion is unnecessary trolling and/or un-funny: Barbara Bush-baiting, Operation Chickenhawk -- which reads like a hackneyed SNL script, and the Bob Jones University episode. Some people will doubtless find &quot;Supply-Side Jesus&quot; offensive, but that's the intention. <br />Everything else ranges from giggles to gut-busting, but a warning should come with this book. You may laugh while reading &quot;Lies&quot; but it will leave any thinking person who loves America (yes, loves -- neo-cons don't hold a monopoly on our country just yet) infuriated. As Franken says, this is &quot;kidding on the square&quot;; you'll be grinning with your teeth clenched. <br />Where's the &quot;constructive criticism?&quot; Very simple, given throughout the book: <br />Stop lying.	2003-09-20

What really got to me though was the time I was channel surfing and stopped and watched the book expo in LA that Pat Schroeder (our former district 1 Congresswoman from Colorado) was presiding over.  The way that Bill O'Reilly reacted to Al Franken's talk was unbelievable.  I've since watched O'Reilly on his Fox show and see that what Franken writes about O'Reilly is well-researched.  This is not material that has &quot;spin&quot; on it as O'Reilly calls it; it is well researched information about not really conservative talk show hosts, but guys who say they're conservative.  In actuality, they just say whatever comes to mind to get the sound-bite. They think they're advancing a conservative agenda when they are really just producing more material to be debunked by anyone so inclined to look up the facts.<br />O'Reilly is just part of the issue.  I'm now more concerned than ever as there is a push here in Colorado to make sure that there are more &quot;conservative&quot; college professors hired at state funded universities.  Since when is political affiliation any part of the picture of education?  It seems that open-mindedness and objectiveness should ultimately drive who is hired, not a leaning to the left or the right.	2003-09-20

For this reason, I don't know why I sought out and purchased this book.  Perhaps it was the shock of the title.  I dunno.  But I can say what kept me interested in the book, interested enough to actually finish it.  Al Franken, in a most readable fashion, methodically points out not just &quot;inaccuracies&quot; (using a photocopy of the front pages of the New York Times to discredit an Ann Coulter claim, for example), but provides insight into what he believes is the overall tone that summarizes and perhaps dictates the right-wing discourse on America's enemies and priorities.  The true heart of this book's message is not a manifestation of Al Franken's ideologic agenda, but rather a product of quoting individuals and generally calling a spade a spade.  I found myself chuckling outloud at least every other page.  The rest of the time, I just thought to myself, &quot;Whoah, this can't be true!&quot;	2003-09-20

Franken makes the same mistakes in this book he points out in Ann Coulter's book.  He particularly is incensed by Ann's mentioning Friedman's equating all religious extremists with Muslim extremists.  He doesn't understand Friedman's original remark, so he doesn't understand how it could be criticized.  The Naked Airline he said (paraphrasing) would solve the flight safety problem (presumably from hijacking in this case) because no religious extremist of any stripe would fly naked.   Perhaps Friedman was trying to be politically correct by not &quot;profiling&quot; Middle Easterners; when in fact no &quot;religious extremists&quot; of any other stripe is doing hijacking in the name of their religion.  Friedman should have said no Mulism religious extremist.  It was disgusting that Franken calls this a lie on Ann's part, when he didn't understand the whole issue.<br />Al Franken may be funny..certainly he sometimes is... but he is not one we should go to for logically thinking or for political advice.

He makes the same mistakes (&quot;he was not his son&quot; - and makes you think there's no connection.  Waits until the citation to tell you, Oh it was his grandson.    Oh big lie.  Shame. Shame)  <br />He completely misunderstood what Mr. Friedman was saying when he lumped all religious fanatics in with what should obviously have only been Muslim religious fanatics.  So naturally he didn't see what Ann Coutler was saying in her book.  He naturally attributes it to dishonesty.   See what I mean?

You may not agree with everything he says, but you can't deny that this book is extremely well researched.  <br />I honestly can't understand how anyone can proudly call themselves Republican after reading this book.  Don't get me wrong, I always had a notion that conservatives were crooked.  But I never imagined the shame that they could bring upon the human race with some of the vile behavior they so proudly exude.  <br />In response to a previous reviewer who said:  <br />&quot;Why do we continue to give no-talent, uneducated, brainless entertainment types a forum to voice really stupid opinons?(sic) &quot; <br />What?  You mean like Rush Limbaugh?  <br />How typically conservative that is.  Ad hominem attacks are all you boys have, isn't it?  I mean, RESEARCH and DEBATE are something you have absolutely no interest in.  We'd probably have to dumb down the discourse just to keep you from drooling all over yourselves if you were to agree to actually be held accountable for your policies.  <br />For a group that so quickly jumps to wrap themselves in the American flag, you sure embrace a lot of unethical and UN-American philosophies.  <br />Buy this book.  It is Fair and Balanced.  And it's HIL-ARIOUS!<br />And a good day to you, sir!	2003-09-19

The chapters detailing and exposing the lies of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are meticulously researched and well documented.  The &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot; chapter and the comic book style &quot;Supply-Side Jesus&quot; offer up a healthy serving of hilarious (but deservedly biting) satire.  The chapter about Paul Wellstone's funeral and how rabid right-wingers (with the aid and comfort of an inept mainstream media) used the Senator's tragic death as a means of pushing a conservative political agenda is both eye-opening and heartbreaking.  Thus far, no one has stepped forward with any credible evidence to challenge or refute Franken's charges; indeed, the right wing has been shockingly silent about the specifics highlighted in this book.  Why?  Clearly because they have no defense when faced with the ugly truth.   Please note how the right wing reviewers here can neither refer to, nor refute, any of the specific accusations that Franken levels against their heros; I mean, it doesn't take a genius to discern that they CLEARLY have not read the book!  It's just more of the same old nasty &amp; under-handed shenanigans from the cabal of lying liars on the right....   But, of course, if they were ever forced to play fair, they'd lose all the time.	2003-09-19

Mr. Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right&quot; is non-fiction. It is not a hate-rag like works by Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He doesn't make baseless opinion and call names. Franken is using almost all facts to make his points. It is hard to argue with facts. Not just facts to back up his own opinion, but to bring down others opinions, such as Ms. Coulter. <br />I assume that most right-wing Conservative will not appreciate Mr. Franken's point of view.

But as a political independent who generally dislikes both pundits and politicans, I found Franken's book as mostly a large dose of liberal self indulgence without a great deal of substance beyond his genuinely funny humor and the self-serving plate of &quot;evidence&quot; he liberally serves to his hungry fans.  Let's be realistic. Could Limbaugh not have found equally compelling evidence from the opposite perspective?  And don't get me wrong:  I'm not a defender nor an admirer of the strident likes of him nor his clones; but like the child who could see the emperor was naked, I can also see that Franken's message is guilty of the same sins as the right-wing &quot;liars&quot; he attacks. Moreover, he's preaching to the choir and likely not expanding its numbers.  It's feel-good reading for an increasingly irrelevant political segment that clearly needs something -- anything -- to feel good about.  Perhaps the book's most impressive attribute is its shrewd sales and marketing positioning in that the author found a void and filled it.  Ironically, Barry Goldwater once said he'd rather be right than president and that seems to be the only conclusive point Franken makes.  At what point is he -- or anyone -- going to write a substantive book that goes beyond the viperous humor and schoolyard whining and shows a liberal model that actually works?  How about &quot;Worker Productivity in France,&quot; &quot;Italy 24/7,&quot; or &quot;California:  The State That Works.&quot;	2003-09-18

Al and his team of researchers check up on all those footnotes in the bestsellers from Hannity, O'reily, coulter, and ginsberg. They found that these works use the often described liberally biased media as a source. Remember, just because you read something in the newspaper doesn't mean it's true. Even if you read it a hundred times. Team Frankin exposes many media myths about Al 'I invented the internet' Gore and Bill 'soft on terrorists' Clinton.  The chapter on the Paul Wellstone memorial is disturbing in how it exposes the attemps from con-artists to describe the memorial as a 'political rally'.  It turns out that this was incredibly dishonest and the media just ran with it. Many talking heads just repeated the story. They never even saw the memorial and admit this in conversations with Al when he confronts them. Turns out they just heard something somewhere so it must be true and worth repeating. Franken is able to set the record straight on this one because he was there. Turns out that Al Gore did create the internet but hte media never covered that story. They went with the alternative story, the gross misquote, &quot;I invented the internet&quot;.

Someone is finally standing up to the right-wing rhetoric that the media inundates us with day in, day out.  It's absurd: every time you turn on cable news, some right-winger is bellowing about the downfall of morality in modern times because of the &quot;liberal-controlled media.&quot;  Funny: I can't find one single liberal news show, and believe me, we need one to balance out the bellowing of the right-wingers.<br />While the right-wing morons generally out-shout their opponents, Franken uses humor to deflate their absurd arguments.  He reveals how Fox News is operated and controlled by the right wing, and how preposterous their claim to &quot;fair and balanced&quot; reporting is.  It's a sad state of affairs when a &quot;news&quot; channel can lie outright about its content, and then sue Franken when he exposes these lies.  Someone really should sue Fox News for false advertising or unethical business practices under Cal Bus Code Section 17200.  Fox News is less &quot;fair and balanced&quot; than O'Reilly's last gig on &quot;Inside Edition.&quot;<br />Franken makes short shrift of Coulter, O'Reilly, and Hannity.  It's refreshing that there are voices like Franken's out there.  If one were to go by cable news alone, one would think that America was a nation of brain-dead sycophants in a cult of slave worship to their Chimp Prince Dubya.	2003-09-18

Unlike his conservative rivals' books, his book is well researched and his preparation pays off again and again in his conflicts with conservative icons.  He points out that the right is going for power at all costs by telling lies and being mean-spirited (which anyone who has seen right-wing media can confirm).<br />This book is utterly a pleasure to read.  Of course it comes down with the hard facts, but it also serves them with some top class comedy.  You won't be able to put it down for a second.  In the changing climate today, I think people are more open-minded about the Bush presidency, and they should really read this book so that they can understand what is going on in the Whitehouse and in the Republican halls of power.  Some of the things that you will learn will have you laughing out loud, but others will just make you shake your head and wonder what this world is coming to.  Check it out.

They also received and ignored substantive information that a catastrophic attack would occur in 2001.

I guess he's a good substitute for Michael Moore, who isn't really credible since he eats more than a small African nation (Don't drive an SUV, but take your motorcycle to Taco Bell eight times a day).<br />As noted by other reviewers here, Al Franken immediately loses credibility with his Paul Wellstone memorial comments. The event evolved into a Democratic rally with some very tasteless comments by his campaign staff.

But that's the essence of this book. Democrats are compelled to say things they don't really believe, or in most cases just make it up, as in Franken's analysis of the Wellstone memorial. You'll never hear Republicans say they &quot;support the troops&quot; because you KNOW they do.<br />Al Franken and friends are the whiners in the peanut gallery, petty armchair quarterbacks who have nothing constructive to say.

I think the content is great, particularly how the Bush administration put very little priority on the terrorism warnings and attacks (remember the last one was the Cole bombing in October 2000, 1 month before the election).  Al Franken calls it Operation Ignore.  Also great is the comparison of Reagan's budget proposals vs. what Congress passed (Congress only added 47 B$ over those 8 years, and actual spending was 200 B$ higher than Reagan's proposals over those 8 years) -- showing that the Reagan years $1.4 Trillion increase in the national debt was about $1.2 Trillion because of Reagan's tax cuts and spending.<br />BUT I GET MADDER AND MADDER THINKING ABOUT HOW THE BOOK HAS NO INDEX, MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYTHING.  That the book has no index is no doubt due to it being rushed to print 2 months early to take advantage of all the publicity it got when Fox was threatening to sue.<br />The lack of an index makes me recommend looking for another similar book like Joe Conason's Big Lies book, or wait for the next book like this to come out.	2003-09-17

This proves that said reviewers do not have a firm grasp on the English langauge and it's laughable that they use such logic to justify a negative review.  \\"Lying\\" is an adjective and \\"Liars\\" is a noun, both words complement eachother, they do not cancel out nor contradict.

That is, five stars to balance out all of the \\"1 star\\" sour grapes reviews. This is an excellent book, filled with wit and intelligence. Franken's voice and persona translate rather nicely to print. Throughout the work, he rightfully takes right-wing figures to task for their distortions. Franken wonders aloud why these people cannot honestly convey themselves: if their ideologies are so sound, why do they feel compelled to distort?  For instance, he notes that some of the distortions made by Ann Coulter (to name one such \\"liar\\") are so egregiously misleading that they suggest that she doesn't trust her audience to weigh her presented evidence and come to the same conclusion. Rather, her actions often demonstrate contempt for her audience. Most important in all of this, Franken supplies data (including footnotes) to support his arguments. <br />Unfortunately, this effort is lost on those who would actually take time to disparage Franken's book on Amazon.{com.} The amazing number of poor reviews displayed here are, predictably, from people who clearly have an agenda and want to harm sales. They offer little in substantive critique, and rather launch into ad hominem attacks on the author. They do this with great venom, and with all the wit and intelligence of a gym sock.  While its understandable that people who feel threatened by ideas contrary to their own would lash out, it's unfortunate that these people cannot rise to the level of decent, informed political discourse. Or, at the very least, attack the work on its merits.	2003-09-17

His idea that we must attack the right wing knuckle draggers not by lying,as they do, but by being &quot;funny and attractive&quot; is right on point. Franken masterfully makes this book readable through the use of hysterical antics.  The substance of the book,however, is not lost in all the humor.  He takes to task people like Bill O'liely,  Ann &quot;she-devil&quot; Coulter and the current, selected occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  In all seriousness, this is not an attack on the political ideology of those on the right.  Instead, it is a careful dissection of the half-truths the right wingers steadily feed to the masses everyday.

I consider myself in the middle and in my opinion, the book hits on a great many truths.  On occassion Franken does seem to be on the defensive regarding Democrats and Clinton, as you might expect him to.  Nonetheless, that does not in anyway overshadow the points he makes regarding the conservative, rather than liberal, influence in the media today.  Franken's serious points are backed by references and when he's joking, he makes it clear that he is.  If you watch Fox News Channel for a day, you'll see that Franken is not making this stuff up.<br />I do recommend this book to those on both sides.  It is definitely interesting reading and Franken's wit is not over-the-top.  The book will obviously leave a bad taste in the mouths of conservatives but the information about their representatives (both in Washington and in the media) is information that they should be aware of.  Liberals will be able to use this as ammunition for political discussions for at least a year, maybe two.	2003-09-17

If you liked Quantum Leap (and evidently Franken really did) and your favorite actor of all time is Scott Bakula then you will cherish this book. I'm referring to a 75 page episode of Quantum Leap that follows a brief 2 page description of Bill O'Reilley. Apparently Franken was not able to get a job writing for the show when it was popular so he wants to show the world what they missed. In case you don't plan on reading the book, here's what the world missed: A lot of disturbingly graphic depictions of Sam Beckett (Bakula) having all sorts of sexual encounters. I was disgusted and on the verge of vomiting several times yet I read through to the end of the episode. But instead of an ending Franken directs you to a website. The website is full of raunchy, raunchy porn. If you subscribe for $24.95/month you can read the ending to Franken's Quantum Leap episode. In case you aren't planning on subscribing (the porn is really nasty) to the website, here's what your missing: Beckett (again that's Bakula) runs into Ann Coulter at a Star Trek convention and they do things that are beyond the pale.

Franken, who seems to get genuinely angry by what he sees in the media and from the White House, deftly avoids shrill and strident attacks of the right (of which, unfortunately, Michael Moore's Stupid White Men was often guilty). Instead he cuts them down by combining some sophomoric insults (and I mean that in good way) with decently researched facts, courtesy of a team of Harvard students. I say 'decently' researched because several large sections almost seemed to be taken directly from Eric Alterman's What Liberal Media? In fact, in the acknowledgements, he thanks Alterman for writing a book that he basically just added jokes to. <br />The beginning of the book is dedicated to debunking the likes of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity. Shooting fish in the barrel of course, and hardly worthy of any serious debate, but definitely good grist for the humor mill. He moves on to anything and everything having to do with the right, inlcuding of course, George Bush, the war in Iraq (which he initially supported), environmental policy, tax cuts, and one of the better chapters: &quot;I Meet Barbara Bush and it Doesn't Go Well.&quot; Good fun for liberals and democrats, with just enough journalistic rigor.	2003-09-17

This is a magnificent foray  by a self-avowed liberal into the right-wing dominated world of political invective.

The chapters on FOX Broadcasting are worth the price of the book alone. An aside: A reviewer with Ann Coulter's testosterone reviewed this book with the not-so-clever witticism that &quot;Lying liars&quot; is incoherent--if not an oxymoron. Not true, of course.

If, like me, you see the country slipping further and further into the clutches of the hypocritical right, READ THIS BOOK. Franken takes each right-wing talking head, pundit and politician one by one and exposes them for the liars and hypocrites they are. Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, Limbaugh, Rove, Bush, Rice and others are caught red-handed lying to the American public. What is truly amazing is how easy it was for TeamFranken to expose these lies. Sometime, just a simple phone call to a source (which the liar never bothered to make) was all it took. Franken also debunks the \\"liberal media\\" myth so often spewed by these types.<br />While overall the book keeps a light and humorous tone, there are very serious issues discussed as well, such as the Bush administration's unwillingness to take action against al Quaida, as recommended to Condoleeza Rice at least 8 months prior to 9/11/01 (to the \\"HUH?\\" reviewer who questions this, it was in Time magazine. Condoleeza met with Sandy Berger & Richard Clarke in January 2001, weeks before assuming her post--ever hear of a transition team?--and received a detailed plan to take out al Quaida, which she ignored), and the shameful coverage of the Wellstone memorial service.<br />Franken strikes a blow for the truth in this highly entertaining and informative look at the vast right-wing conspiracy.	2003-09-16

This is a wonderful Christmas gift for hyphenated Americans because it illustrates the difference between Republicans and Democrats. The poor liberals can't bear to read an offending sentence, so Al Franken willingly gives them an anti-conservative diatribe to make them feel good about themselves, a refreshing pause in their self-loathing and Bush-hating. Poor Al can't even get the title right. A &quot;lying liar&quot; is actually a truthteller. Think about it.<br />But yeah, I enjoyed the self-delusional tone of the book. Al is mad because most people saw the Wellstone memorial for what is was: a disgrace and an embarrassment for Democratic politicians. It's obvious why Franken was so thorough with his footnotes this time. He had to be - DUH - this is a serious work (wink wink nudge nudge).

I just became more involved since I started seeing some subtle but not unnoticeable changes in the mood and attitude of this nation. Then, realizing how these changes could affect my life, I started reading and inquiring more and more about what was going on in the political arena. Well, since then, I've been amazed by how a group of people (in this case from the right, but what really matter is their attitude rather than their ideology) have been able to monopolize and manipulate the public opinion of the US without really leaving any room for dissent. And what is even more amazing for me is the fact that the reasons why this group of people are now so powerful are mainly bogus, fake, lies. I did not know Al Franken before I heard of the lawsuit. I should thank   Fox for spreading the word. But I guess they really did not want that to happen. So I'll just give my congratulations to Al Franken for his witty and inquisitive writing and, above all, for his and his team's perseverance and diligence in researching the facts to disprove some big fat lies that this group of people have been using to gain more and more power. Oh, and last but not least...it's funny!	2003-09-16

To the reviewer who claims this book should be in the &quot;Fiction&quot; section of bookstores, exactly which facts in the book do you dispute?  Check out Spinsanity.com's dissection of LIES.  While they usually lay waste to most polemics (including Michael Moore's STUPID WHITE MEN) through their fact-checking expertise, they pretty much say Franken's facts are on the level.  There is apparently one instance where he attributes a quote to the wrong person, but it's mostly an inconsequential gaffe.  Most of their problem with the book is its tone, which is extremely sarcastic<BR>and acerbic.<br />...which is EXACTLY why it's so darn funny!!!  Without a doubt, this book has more laughs in it than Moore's book, because it really takes no prisoners (SWM struck me as a little defeatist).  The claims being made in Franken's book seem to be much better researched, and makes a VERY SOLID CASE AGAINST the idea of the so-called &quot;Liberal Media&quot; (at least not one with any clout), while making the case that there IS a very powerful &quot;Right-Wing Media&quot;.  <br />I have to assume that the &quot;Fiction&quot; reviewer hasn't ACTUALLY read the book, but I hope he does so very soon, and with an open mind.

'03). They are asked about what September 11, 2001, was like for them personally, and, although over 3,000 people had just perished, George W. was able to find some humor by the end of that day: <br />Peggy Noonan (the interviewer): You were separated on September 11th. What was it like when you saw each other again? Laura Bush: Well, we just hugged. I think there was a certain amount of security in being with each other than being apart. George W. Bush: But the day ended on a relatively humorous note. The agents said, &quot;you'll be sleeping downstairs. Washington's still a dangerous place.&quot; And I said no, I can't sleep down there, the bed didn't look comfortable. I was really tired, Laura was tired, we like our own bed. We like our own routine. You know, kind of a nester. I knew I had to deal with the issue the next day and provide strength and comfort to the country, and so I needed rest in order to be mentally prepared. So I told the agent we're going upstairs, and he reluctantly said okay. Laura wears contacts, and she was sound asleep. Barney was there. And the agent comes running up and says, &quot;We're under attack. We need you downstairs,&quot; and so there we go. I'm in my running shorts and my T-shirt, and I'm barefooted. Got the dog in one hand, Laura had a cat, I'm holding Laura --Laura Bush: I don't have my contacts in , and I'm in my fuzzy house slippers --George W. Bush: And this guy's out of breath, and we're heading straight down to the basement because there's an incoming unidentified airplane, which is coming toward the White House. Then the guy says it's a friendly airplane. And we hustle all the way back up stairs and go to bed. Mrs. Bush: [LAUGHS] And we just lay there thinking about the way we must have looked. <br />Peggy Noonan (interviewer): So the day starts in tragedy and ends in Marx Brothers. <br />George W. Bush: THAT'S RIGHT-- WE GOT A LAUGH OUT OF IT!(end)Although America had just suffered the worst attack ever on our own soil, somehow this man was able to end his day on a funny note. I wonder how many of the 3,000 families who lost someone earlier that day had a funny ending before they went to sleep? Please read the above exchange aloud to anyone who will listen. It speaks volumes.	2003-09-16

It won't make any wingnuts angry because they won't read it (and haven't in spite of the reviews).  Any free thinking American with half a peanut rattling around in their skull will be angry at the mendacious nature of what passes for debate on the far right.  As Al points out, it is the far right that is the problem because they base their &quot;arguments&quot; on lies and simply keep repeating those lies.  Anyone who disagrees with them is branded a traitor, treasonous, anti-American.  However, Al writes truthfully that there is a healthy debate somewhere in the middle.  Note to conservatives:  Al is not attacking all of you, just the extreme fringe that seems to have hijacked the Republican party and insists on stifling debate by wrapping everything in the flag.  All of us somewhere in the middle need to take the country back from the lying administration of W and his minions in the far right press.  All the sensible conservatives need to take their movement back from these same people lest they be permanently branded as being in alliance with those seeking to destroy all that has made this country as strong as it is.  All of you atavistic conservatives who want to take the country back to pre-Great Society, or pre-New Deal, days, go back and read a history book to see how good things were not.  These social engineering programs, while not perfect, laid the foundation for what made America as strong as it was, and as much a guiding light as it was to people around the world, prior to W's presidency.<br />Read this book but prepare to be angry at how the far right uses falsehoods to support its platforms.  Read this book and prepare yourself to fight for something good that is greater than just the individual.

I truly hope and trust it is going to be the straw that breaks the back of the worst cabal of thieves, liars, sycophants and con men (and women) this nation has ever seen.  As a recent Nobel prize winner for Economics said in the German press a few weeks ago, George W. Bush has been the worst president who has ever darkened the doors of the White House in all the history of the United States.  Thank God we didn't elect him!  Franken's book is extremely funny, deeply troubling, saddening and infuriating all at the same time.  Big Al, like his spiritual father, Will Rogers, uses humor at times like a stileto, sometimes like a mace, and still again, like a bulldozer.  His parries of the thrusts of the likes of Coulter, O'Reilly, Limbaugh et al, are alone worth the price of the book.  But his devastating indictment of the Bush administration's &quot;Operation Ignore&quot;, followed immediately by their &quot;Operation Blame-former-Presidnt-Clinton&quot;, and of other blatantly treasonous actions, may well be worth the Presidency.  If ever a president deserved impeachment, it is George W. Bush, who has, as Fraken abundantly demonstrates, in large part been almost totally responsible (with the collusion of almost all Republican members of Congress and more than a few craven Democrats) for the derelictions of duty that resulted in 9/11, for the largest current and even larger impending budget deficit(s) in history, for the killing and maiming of tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians and thousands of young American service personnel with no end in sight.  Unfortiunately, we, our children, and the world will pay for George W. Bush's malfeasance for generations.  If you read no other portion of Franken's book, read the two chapters that start on page 104.  Most of the book is liberally leavened with humor, but not even funnyman Al Franken can find humor in this 20 or so page account of high crimes and misdemeanors.  It is a great book.  As important in our time as was Common Sense in pre-Revolutionary War days.  Buy several and give them to your friends to pass on.  If you do, we may yet save out country.   wfh	2003-09-16

(He has an awful lot of friends in high places to pay off).

The Democrats only tell you that because they don't want you to get angry with them when they raise your taxes. (The Federal income tax rate was around 4% before WW2). 2) The Federal government, with a trillion dollar payroll, is way too big and the only party willing to reduce its size is the Republican Party. 3) Democrats acquire and keep power by keeping the government large by collecting gigantic sums and spending even larger sums. 4) Anyone who disagrees with their twisted philosophy is instantly branded &quot;a liar&quot; or &quot;cold hearted&quot;. <br />If you want a real feel for what's going on in the world of politics, check out Treason or Slander by Ann Coulter. She'll tell you how the Democrats knowingly protected Soviet spies for the past sixty years.	2003-09-15

Sure, Al is often shrill and sometimes profane but he backs up his outraged views with facts unlike the bull spouted by Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity and their ilk.

Al is clearly a liberal, writing about certain out-of-control conservative ideologues, and it's not going to be pretty.  But it is funny.  And yes, fair.  For instance, in describing the Wellstone memorial service, he did not defend everything that was said; he admitted that part of it got out of hand.  Rather, he said that that segment was not representative of the memorial service as a whole, but was presented as such in the media.  The people he attacks and makes fun of in this book would never make that kind of distinction.  For them, it is always a zero sum game, which is why they have to distort that part of the truth they're not comfortable with.  That is, they have to lie.<br />For me, the most effective and refreshing part was the flat declaration that the Fox emperor has no clothes.  Whenever any organization has to continually describe itself as &quot;fair and balanced,&quot; chances are they're neither.  All you have to do is compare Fox's coverage of any controversial subject with that of other networks, and you can see the difference is that others often offer more than one side; Fox does not.  It is refreshing to see someone successfully expose the lie of &quot;The No Spin Zone&quot; (basically &quot;spin&quot; on that show is any opinion or fact of which O'Reilly disapproves).  Best of all was the analysis of HANNITY &amp; colmes, because Fox commonly touts that show as an example of its &quot;balance;&quot; it was good to see someone just say honestly that colmes is no match for HANNITY, and that HANNITY can get away with saying anything on the show because of that.<br />A couple of chapters (Barbara Bush, Bob Jones U) were entertaining, but peripheral to the purpose of the book and probably should have been left out.  It's an easy read, unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, and I found it hard to put down.  <br />Another good section rehabilitated Al Gore in my mind.  I voted for him, but reluctantly,and Franken's book actually demonstrates that a number of raps on him during the campaign were not truthful (of course, no right-winger caused him to behave so weird during the third debate).<br />Bottom line:  If you're a hard-line conservative, you probably won't like it.  But if you're in the middle (there is still a middle in America, isn't there?), you'll find it funny, informative, imperfect, and fair--but not balanced.  And you have to be smart enough to take some of the humor--including the title--in the tongue in cheek manner in which it was intended.  The Chickenhawks chapter, for instance, is satirical humor; it did not really occur.  Down, Ann.  Down.<br />If this book results in just one reader coming to the realization that dissent such as this is Not Treason--that it is an essential part of America--then the book will have accomplished something.  Hope it does.	2003-09-15

He is insightful, honest, and explains complex social and political issues in blunt transparent terms.  I don't think it's possible to offer an analysis of the state of our political discourse and our policy choices without pointing out the humor in it.  <BR>  By making the analysis and commentary humorous, Franken shows exactly how serious this is in a way only a good comedian with great Harvard researchers can do.  <BR> This is obviously not a fair and balanced reporting.  Fair -- yes.  Balanced -- no, but the points need to be made loudly.  My goal is to get as many conservatives I can to read this book, if only just to put more money in Franken's pocket, but hopefully to help them see the world from a more honest and less selfish perspective.	2003-09-15

I have no way of checking the facts in Al Franken's latest book any more than I would any other book I've read.  You read a book, you evaluate its ideas in light of your own experiences, you make a decision.  It's very similar to being on a jury -- you listen, you weight, you decide.<br />'Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right' stikes me as the truth.  <br />And that's what hurts.  Once you start understanding what Al Franken is saying, you realize how our beloved freedom of speech is being used against us; how it's being used to grind all the compromise and discourse out of our political lives.  Lies hidden in innuendo.  People called traitor for having a differing opinion.  The free press printing and reprinting all of it.  I begin to dispair.<br />Thankfully this book is also very funny.  Al Franken's touch is a bit heavy handed at times, but he makes his point with wit and humor.  It helps a lot to face this country's problems with laugh -- makes them smaller somehow.  It makes the lying liars smaller too.  It leaves you with the feeling we're gonna make it after all.	2003-09-15

The writing is straightfoward, well organized, and sharp-witted.  Bush took the White House without the majority of the popular vote.  Congress is controlled by the Republicans and the Supreme Court leans to the Right at about 5 to 4 right now with the probability that one or two will resign before W leaves office in '04.  Fox News is all right wing.  MSNBC isn't far behind and I don't need to mention the Right wing AM radio all across the US.  SO, the Left needs a voice.  The left needs a well-researched answer to all the right wing claims and complaints - now more than ever.

For people who consider themselves conservatives, the style of this book will be a challenge. This is unfortunate, as many of these folks might be shocked to learn just how far around the bend their leaders and media champions have gone to 'win'. For 'middle of the political roaders' and disenfranchised potential voters who have been too numbed to pay attention and get out to a polling place recently, this book should be required reading before November '04. For Liberals - well, you sort of new this stuff all along, and this is a reason to laugh through the tears of frustration and rage. The media attack dogs of the right and their masters in the inner sanctum of the Republican party have been alarmingly effective at twisting facts and stifling honest and reasonable political discourse for more than two decades. Americans are way past-due for an antidote to the invective from Rove, Atwater, Rush, Coulter, North, Colson, Poindexter, et al. that has come close to terminally poisoning the political process. Without the anti-emetic effects of humor, this catalogue of the Right's political tactics would be too infuriating to read.	2003-09-14

But I find it laughable that people here think that Al Franken speaks the truth. For example, his coverage of the Wellstone &quot;memorial&quot;... anyone who watched that service knows that it evolved into an anti-administration rant by a couple of Wellstone's close friends, but that seems to escape many of the reviewers here, who probably did not watch it themselves as Republicans walked out of the service. The problem with this book is that Franken is preaching to a bereft choir, a collection of losers who are mad at Bush and Republicans for ignoring their plaintive whines. You can just picture the &quot;progressives&quot; violently nodding in agreement as they whip through the book: the new liberal manifesto. I'm sure most of the humor escapes them, too - they lost that sense a long time ago because of their fear of offending. But one really can't take Franken too seriously... amusing book but utterly throwaway with a few nitpicky insights.	2003-09-14

You don't have to disagree with someone to realize that they are presenting material as 'facts' that are simply not true.  <br />I encourage everyone to read this book - get it from a library if you do not want to support Al Franken financially.  Look at the facts that he presents that suggests that certain Republican spokepeople routinely present false information and then do the research yourself.  If you can prove Al wrong - terrific, let him know.  He would probably appreciate it. If, however, you find his research thorough and on target, then stop and think why lying is becoming normal and acceptable?  Why are you &quot;leftist&quot; and &quot;unpatriotic&quot; merely by pointing out inaccuracies?<br />It is time to put conversation back into democracy before we give up the freedoms we suggest that we are willing to fight and have American's die for.

Just brushing books like this aside as liberal fiction isn't going to get it done anymore folks! Conservatives who haven't actually read the book, note how 10% or less of the readers found your reviews helpful. This book represents a line in the sand for progressives/liberals. Gentlemen, if your going to post a BOOK REVIEW on the internet then don't waste the reader's time with childish insults like \\"Victim Party,\\" liberals being \\"wimpy\\" and \\"...running to Mommy,\\" or how anything this left of center is a \\"journey into total fiction.\\" Unless that is, you'd like to further embarrass your constituency and add fuel to Franken's arguments about the Right.	2003-09-14

Anyone who's watched, read or listened to O'Reilly, Coulter and Hannity will enjoy the all-American thrill of seeing pompous bullys knocked down to size.  <br />Through anecdote, research and analysis, Franken examines the seven pillars of truth in conservative and right-wing circles.  (Eight of the pillars are &quot;it's Clinton's fault&quot;.)  He doesn't focus on the broader issues of ideology and institutional bias that Jonathan Alterman discusses.  <br />There are several very funny gages, jokes and passages.  But overall, the tone is analytical rather than amusing.<br />I recommend this for any reader with an interest in politics and public policy who is willing to spend some time re-examining &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;.	2003-09-14

You have outdone yourself.  Not only do you expose the lying liars for what they are, you do it in such a clever way that some conservatives don't even get the irony of the subtitle, even as they are being unfair and biased (see the following cretinous review).  Don't get me wrong, this book is for conservatives.  You've got to buy this book if you like Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter or President Bush; all your favorite Republican stars and politicos are quoted heavily, and you find out all kinds of interesting background and anecdotes about them.  Honest, I haven't read anything with such relish in I can't remember when.  I don't know what a &quot;WRITTING STYLE&quot; is (see Taymyr's review), but if that's a cross between witty and writing, Al has it in spades.  As for intellectual content, the truth has always been an intellectual pursuit and, Mr. Franken, I'm happy that someone is standing up against throwing the truth in the trash.	2003-09-13

Al Franken packs his book with hilarious anecdotes about the likes of Paul Wolfowitz, Tucker Carlson and, of all people, Barbara Bush. Moreover, he's not afraid to laugh at himself -- a lovely and rare quality among political commentators. Just as admirable is his ability to poke gentle fun at those who don't necessarily share his ideology (the chapter on Bob Jones University is hilarious and strangely affectionate and touching) and actually maintain genuine friendships with the most conservative of individuals (who would ever have guessed that he'd be friends with Gary Bauer??).<br />But make no mistake. This is a serious-minded book about serious subjects. It's beautifully documented and analyzed. His critics would be very hard pressed to find inaccuracies or embellishments. <br />Speaking of his critics, it's so patently obvious that those individuals who gave it a low rating haven't in fact read it (does a single one of them actually cite *anything* from the book? I think not). That's a pity. They could learn something, share some good humour, and have a good time along the way.<br />I highly recommend this book. Anyone who can count an Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly or George W Bush fan among his or her immediate family or circle of friends should purchase this book for that person and MAKE HIM OR HER READ IT. Or better, read it aloud to them and watch the hilarity ensue.	2003-09-13

After observing aggressive conservatives over the years through the media, in print and on internet mediums such as this I realize just how dead-on Franken is.  For example:<br />Coulter regularly states that \\"liberals\\" hate themselves, hate people of color, hate honest working-class people, and unfairly judge women based upon their looks.<br />Coulter also states that Middle Easterners \\"smell\\", that black people are \\"lazy\\", that the working-class should be called the \\"non-working class\\" and that her blonde hair and mini-skirts were the keys to her success.  She also thinks that women should be denied the vote.  Close friends of Coulter have stated that she is incredibly unhappy and jealous of women who can manage to have successful relationships and marriages, unlike herself.<br />This strange sort of contradiction is echoed many times over within your extremist brand of conservativism.  You say you are more \\"moral\\" than so-called liberals, yet you are so full of hate for anyone who is different from you that you probably live a pretty non-moral lifestyle.  Didn't Jesus say to love your neighbor?  Didn't Jesus say to turn the other cheek?   You honk on about Clinton's scandal, yet you support a drug addict/alcoholic as pResident - a person who lied to get us into a war and who is responsible for every American soldier who dies on his watch.  <br />So you're a bunch of hypocrites - a pack of lying liars, if you will, and I think that's really the issue.  You are so filled with shame and rage when someone like Moore or Franken calls you out and exposes you and your heroes for the frauds you are that you retaliate in the only way you know - to spout more lies and equivocal, personal attacks as loudly as you can.  In this case, to claim you've read the book and say that it's a \\"joke\\" or \\"horrible\\" or \\"not worth reading\\" because that's what your brainwashers have told you to do.<br />Didn't God say, \\"Thou Shalt Not Lie\\"?  What does God do to liars, anyway?  I guess you'll find out, one of these days.<br />I don't hate you because you have a political opinion that differs from mine.  I am sad for a lot of you because you so obviously cannot think for yourselves.  You blindly and willingly believe anything that you are told as long as it fits into your very narrow world-view.  You think that this Earth was created for you and you alone; that there is no room for different opinions or lifestyles.  You are undoubtedly very unhappy in many aspects of your life, and it's a shame that the NeoConservative heroes you look up to capitalize on that unhappiness to make themselves richer.<br />Very soon now George Bush will be voted out of office because, fortunately, most Americans love this country enough to want what is in this country's best interest.  The Radical Right, after years of bellyaching, finally got their chance at running this country and have run it into the ground instead.  And after George Bush looses the election you will no doubt join in with your fellow non-thinkers and decry \\"evil\\" liberals for taking away the good ol' days of record deficits, military un-intelligence and sky-high unemployment from you. <br />Each time you post somewhere... each time you \\"review\\" a book on Amazon or elsewhere... each time you fill yourself with hate and venom toward people trying to make a positive difference in this country... you are actually doing us a favor.  You're letting the world know just how ridiculous and misinformed you really are.  You aren't taken seriously, and the most anyone feels for you is sorry that you've allowed yourself to become so tunnel-blind and CONTROLLED.<br />So keep on posting your one-star reviews.  Good liberals such as myself take joy in the fact that you've chosen to expose how ignorant you really are to the rest of thethinking world.  You are walking advertisements for why people need to read authors like Franken, Vidal, Alterman and Moore.  Despite what your pResident would like to see happen in this great country of ours, WE still believe in our Constitution.  WE will die protecting the very thing that makes us strong - the freedoms that fascists like you would take away from other Americans through your blind ignorance.<br />Try as you might, WE will keep speaking the truth and protecting this country from the REAL threat to our national security - YOU!<br />Thanks again for apparently being devoid of any intelligence whatsoever.

One small thing, however, in which I was personally disappointed was Al's rather narrow-minded and sometimes disparaging view of Islam. Otherwise, a great read.

Team Franken, as Al Franken likes to call his group of hip research assistants, help provide the all-too-revealing look at those who profess to be `fair' and work in a `no spin zone,' but appear better suited to an episode of the Twilight Zone (apologies to Rod Serling's legacy).  Franken's wit on the page might be even funnier than hearing Franken speak...which is quite difficult to do. He exposes Bill O'Reilly as a blowhard loudmouth, who wouldn't know a Peabody award if he was \\"Pead\\" on, Sean Hannity as one who plays fast and loose with the facts, Ann Coulter as a bad blonde joke, who takes statements out of context, doesn't know her own age, and may well have committed voter [errors] (if you can believe her driver's license), and Alan Colmes the diminutive and toothless left-wing punching bag. This book is a masterpiece.  Unlike most stories that are based on facts, this one is loaded with thorough documentation and the research is impeccable.

I read this &quot;book&quot; while waiting for my wife to load up on the new set of Dr. Phil books.

You Republicans must respect me.&quot; The problem is that Republicans like to stick to facts, while authors like Franken are reminded of their dreary childhoods and prefer ad hominem attacks, which is basically what the book is all about. It's a speed reader's 10-minute rant, where you end up feeling sorry for the guy and all of his clinging fans (see below). Hear this Republicans - liberals are angry, but they have NO idea what to do about it except whine about Bush and &quot;do something&quot;. Franken likes to tell everyone that he went to Harvard, but I believe someone wrote a book titled &quot;Useful Idiots&quot;, and that fits the bill perfectly.

Always antischolar, the racuous Right has taken to publishing books laced with pseudo-research, ghosted by Murdock hacks and breathlessly reviewed on Fox News, the fopish Rubublican house organ.<BR><br />Conservative authors are justifiably confident in their readership's inability to know a footnote from a endnote (right Ann?) much less actually read and research one.  This makes it possible for conservatives to annotate patent falsehoods and give them an air of \\"authority\\", based on the belief of dittoheads and other smooth-lobed bipeds that anything so annotated must be verified.  Attend, for instance, Al Franken's ability to easily expose the convoluted, mawkish errors in a Reagan fiscal chart published by Sean Hannity, who knows Eleven Things. P.T. Barnum made millions off of Conservatives.<BR><br />This is one of the reasons why the work of Al Franken is so important. He explores the sources of these Conservative hate screeds and finds--surprise, surprise--that they have the air-tight integrity of a sieve.  Watch closely.  As the glazed-eyed, gape-mouthed Limbaugh fans log in en masse to pan a book they refuse to buy or read, they will not refute a single point Franken makes, but will resort to pathos-filled rhetoric and supersimplified dismissals.

I guess it must be tough to stand behind one's review of a book when one hasn't actually read it.)<br />If, in fact, this person has read the book, this &quot;review&quot; constitutes a willful misrepresentation of its contents and viewpoint: another lie.<br />The only slightly charitable interpretation one can make is that the person actually read the book and believes his stated opinion to be accurate, which simply reveals an utter lack of reading comprehension, (another possible explanation for the right's distortions, unexplored by Mr. Franken).	2003-09-12

This book was by definition a fact checking mission.  Don't you think Franken knew that if he included one unsupportable statement his critics would try to use it to discredit the entire book?  I would wager that the editing process was a brutal one in the interest of avoiding such a problem.  Humor has been used throughout human history as part of deeply complex and serious debate and is also used in this instance, I believe, as a device for relief for moderates and liberals who have experienced increasing frustration over the endless flow of untrue, un-researched and even infantile statements and writings from some on the right.  You may not like Franken, liberals, or the facts, but any wholesale condemnation of this book on the basis of its accuracy is not valid.	2003-09-12

He makes the argument that this happens because commentators don't do adequate research or do the leg-work that is necessary (such as phoning sources) to double-check facts and this has resulted in laissez-faire journalism. The stories are then spun in such a way as to inflame the public. Since this has happened so often over the past twenty years, the mainstream media has been conditioned to pick up these stories right away so they can be on top of stories that people are hearing on conservative talk shows. But while the mainstream media continues to pick up these stories from the right, conservative commentators criticize the media as being liberal which seems to push news organizations more to the right as they try to grab the attention of conservative audiences. <br />As a result of the severe lashing out by the right, we've gotten to the point where the mainstream media is reticent to sounding critical of the Bush administration or its policies, which is detrimental to democracy in this country.<br />This well-researched book provides many concrete examples of this type of reporting and demonstrates how the Bush administration has manipulated the media to disseminate lies of its own (like &quot;We found the weapons of mass destruction&quot;). <br />The reason that people find this book so hilarious is because Al uses the same tone and language that you hear when you listen to conservative commentators and turns it on them. As evident from comments from conservative readers, this apparently infuriates them. But probably not enough to change the conservative dialogue to a more civil tone.	2003-09-12

I'm not going to pay for it because I don't want to encourage Al's childish antics by rewarding him with my money which I'm sure he gives to charity and the Democratic Party.  Al Fraken is full of himself.  In his own eyes he is smarter, more friendly, more benevolent, and less-evil than the Satanic Republicans and Fox News.  He is also much more clever than Darth Ashcroft, Adolph Cheney, George W. Satan. and their imps at Fox-news He proves this by making fools out of them.  Over and over he sets them up, knocks them down, and smiles a self satisfied smile at himself.  Look at me! Al says, I'm smarter than these Powerful and Evil men.  Why, look at my facts, my figures my charts?  Aren't I a witty, intelligent, Harvard, kind of guy?  In fact I'm very much like JFK or Bill Clinton my big heroes.  I give him two stars because he does have a skill.  He has a skill in making people he doesn't like look foolish.  That's something he can be proud of.  However, he doesn't understand anything about humor and politics.  The reason Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Ronald Reagan, William Buckley, and that big fat idiot Rush Limbaugh are/were so succsessful is because they use humor to disarm or entertain their enemies while feeding them their point of view.  Many people have been converted to what Al Franken would call \\"The Dark Side\\" by these men and their sense of humor.  However, Al Fraken's book will convert no one.  His humor does not disarm the conservative reader.  It merely slaps you in the face over and over and over.  Conservatives are stupid, evil, greedy and wrong about everything from Clinton to Communism.  Al comes accross as mean.  He is funny.  I used to laugh when I was a kid in school when the local smart alec teased the fat kid or the ugly girl.  I thought that was funny back then.  I've grown up a little since then.	2003-09-12

That is to win. Crush. Destroy.<br />Al Franken, bless him, has stepped forward to take these so-called conservatives on, one by one.<br />He starts with Ann Coulter, the leader of the pack. In case you don't watch cable, she's against liberals, Democrats, most of the media. They're all traitors, every last one of them.<br />This is very difficult to prove, given that it's a crazy idea. So Coulter has to lie (or, to take the charitable view, be the most incompetent person ever to graduate from a good law school). She says it took the New York Times two days to put the death of blue-collar hero Dale Earnhardt on the front page. Nonsense, says Franken --- and he shows you a picture of the Times front page the day after Earnhardt died, with a big circle around the piece. Better, he exposes how Coulter confuses quotations with endorsements. (What Coulter does is like Bill Nobody writing in Bookreporter, \\"John Grisham is, for my money, the worst novelist alive,\\" and you telling friends, \\"Bookreporter says Grisham sucks.\\" Nothing of the kind. Unless you think quoting someone is endorsing him --- an idea taught in no journalism school I've ever heard of.)<br />One good reason to buy this book: Franken holds Coulter to the standards of her profession. So far, she hasn't thanked him for that. Or commented at all. (But don't we breathlessly await her response?)<br />Then there's Bill O'Reilly. Alone among mortals, he lives in the penthouse of the tower of truth. He never makes mistakes.<br />With a bully like O'Reilly, refutation is easy. He said he won a prestigious journalism award. So Franken looked up the award and found that, no, he didn't. The show he was on did win another award, though --- the year after he left. Or his childhood home. O'Reilly has swornit's Levittown, New York, a working class suburb. In fact, he grew up in nearby Westbury. (Source: O'Reilly's mom. Franken looked up an article that quoted her.) Confronted with the truth, O'Reilly lied again, insisting he grew up in \\"the Westbury section of Levittown.\\" Alas, that doesn't exist.<br />Summary won't do justice to Franken's demolition of Fox's Sean Hannity. So rush out to a bookstore and read pages 85-87 for his confrontation with Hannity, whose allegiance to Rush Limbaugh is so great that he makes himself look like a total idiot. This passage ends with a side-splitting \\"tribute\\" to Alan Colmes, Hannity's \\"liberal\\" sidekick, and all the odd jobs he does at Fox (in addition to being trounced by Hannity on a daily basis).<br />Which brings me to the big difference between screamers like Coulter/O'Reilly and Saturday Night Live grads like Franken: Franken's book is downright funny. Here, you might almost want to make the case that \\"liberals\\" are funnier than \\"conservatives.\\" Because unless you're really, really political, you'll giggle when you read that O'Reilly's new book is LIVING WITH HERPES and Coulter's is THE SLANDER DIET. And you'll smile knowingly at Franken's take on the Bush response to terrorism: \\"At the orange level, the second-highest level of alert, people are still encouraged to go to the mall. At the red level, the highest state of alert, the President suggests that you stay away from public places and instead shop online.\\"<br />Along the way, Franken makes some serious points. If the press is so liberal, why did it kick Gore around? What were the 18 months of Monicagate about? No, if the press has a bias, he says, it's for profits. He compares conservatives to four-year-olds who blindly love Mommy and think anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad; liberals, in comparison, \\"love America like grown-ups.\\" He examines media coverage of Sen. Paul Wellstone's memorial service to show how Rush (of course), Peggy Noonan (surprised me) and Tucker Carlson (ditto) didn't do their homework and, with no apparent concern, repeated a libelously slanted account of that event. And he wonders why real conservatives who abhor the culture of hate in the media don't speak out against the Coulters and O'Reillys.<br />The bad news: Along the way, Franken delivers a lot of stuff that's just...filler. A ten-page cartoon about \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" isn't funny. Neither is a ten-page one-act play. His encounter with Barbara Bush is six pages, but it also feels like ten. And I get a little tired of Franken squabbling with O'Reilly.<br />On the other hand, that jawing made O'Reilly crazy. And it's probably the reason that Fox News sued Franken and his publisher for violating its \\"fair and balanced\\" trademark. As everybody now knows, Fox not only got laughed out of court, but the pre-publication publicity pushed Franken's book to #1 on Amazon.com and sent his publisher back to press.<br />So much for O'Reilly never making a mistake.<br />In our daily lives, when we run into someone who is always angry and insists on simple answers to complex questions and lies a lot, we tend to think, \\"Wow, this person is in a lot of pain. He/she is acting out all over the place. He/she needs help.\\"<br />In book publishing, when an editor runs into someone like that, he/she gets a fat book contract.<br />Which means we can expect more and more \\"conservative\\" books that rant and rave but never quite tell us how we're going to get our jobs back or pay for our retirement or make peace in the Middle East.<br />Which means that more and more \\"liberals\\" will be writing books like Franken's --- books that have some verifiable facts, books that offer the occasional solution, books that even have a bit of humor. How will the so-called conservatives respond? Take a wild guess: They'll go on the attack. Says Franken, \\"I don't want to make it personal, and Bill O'Reilly really has. He's gone after me and said I'm a smear artist. He has not pointed out one thing I've said that isn't true.\\"<br />Don't stay up waiting for O'Reilly to do that. But do catch Franken as he takes his victory-lap tour around the country. Because, whether you agree with him or not, at least he'll give you a laugh. And these days, we can sure use one.<br />   --- Reviewed by Jesse Kornbluth from [website]	2003-09-12

I finished this book feeling a lot like I felt when the U.S. beat Russia at hockey in the Olympics. Take that, tough guys! Our side can get tough, too! &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; is brilliant satire and undeniable truth.  At times Franken's wit is caustic enough to make even the most confrontational liberal squirm.  But, if &quot;we&quot; -- the liberals and moderates -- must sink to &quot;their&quot; (the verbal bullies like O'Reilly, Hannity, and Limbaugh) level to prove we can bite back, it's good to do it with style, intelligence and solid research. Lies...&quot; is informative, thought provoking, and hilarious.  <br />Speaking of hilarious, some of the reviews are pretty funny, too.  For example, the one predicting that a liberal media network will fail &quot;...for lack of real intellectual debate.&quot;  Oh.  Real intellectual debate like when O'Reilly argues that our Constitution is based on the Ten Commandments and not the Magna Carta?  Or when Limbaugh says the same thing , even quoting (wrongly) one of the founding fathers as his source?  Come to think of it, Al Franken has a lot of  nerve taking on such intellectual giants as these.  But he does, and it would take a far more high-minded liberal than I not to enjoy it.

Franken's claims about the dishonesty of various conservatives (O'Reilly, Coulter) are painstakingly documented.

Let me make a common-sense observation: FoxNews filed a frivolous lawsuit in order to delay the release of the book. Their network and commentators are some of Franken's targets.<br />Think about it. If FoxNews is willing to file a silly lawsuit over the phrase &quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot;, then they most certainly will file a libel lawsuit for monetary damages if any of Franken's accusations are untrue. That way, they will be able to squeeze every dime of profit from the book sales, embarrass Franken, and restore their tarnished image.<br />So where's the lawsuit accusing Franken of libel?

Unlike Coulter and the many other hysterical writers who are ripped apart in this book, Franken respects his audience and does not lie to us(he has FOOTNOTES and everything!).  The book is humorous and informative instead of polemical and obnoxious like some books I could mention coughcoughslandercoughcough.  As an interesting side note, I probably would never have read this book had Fox News not sued Franken over its title, thus peaking my interest.

However, I thought his moral standing was undermined by the admission in chapter 5 that he is a child molester.  I realize that the statute of limitations has run out on the particular crimes he confesses to, but still, I'm not sure the country is ready to accept political guidance from an avowed pedophile.

How did I do?<BR>   The guy is a comic genius, and with Team Franken working for him he comes across as a research genius too. I just love the unpredictability of his humor and his ability to hit you out of the blue with wonderful uncensored raunch. But the book devastates the right. By reading the odd vapid review posted here by right-wingers (who clearly haven't even read it) one would think they are dumbstruck. Why no substantive rebuttal's to any points made? I would love to see some substance instead of the blather.<BR>   I thought Franken's Chicken Hawk story was the weakest part humor-wise but his main point here is a good one. A surprising number of hawks on Team Bush took a pass when it came time possibly face war themselves. I loved the Supply Side Jesus cartoon. The \\"Waitress and the Lawyer\\" play was excellent. The 15 or so pages showing how Bush dropped the ball on terrorism before 9/11 are probably the most disturbing. I already knew most of it from an article in TIME mag., but Al and his team put it together in a very powerful and concise way. Not nearly enough is said about how the incredible incompetence of Bush's team left America open to the 9/11 attack. I think we don't hear much about this because people think it might appear as unpatriotic and Americans just don't want to contemplate that they might have a president that in this important area, was this incompetent. And of course, sadly, there is nothing we can do about it now. Rather depressing really but it needs to be said, and Franken knocks it out of the park. If you are going to be disgusted with the facts, you might as have a little humor along with the medicine.<BR>   And that's what this book is, medicine for a nation drunk on endless streams of blatant distortion, lies and effluent put forward by the likes of Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Coulter and Team Bush. The humor is the sugar that helps it go down. But the right-wing faithful are still going to gag, should they read it. And with good reason. Franken takes their \\"geysers of liquefied pig ....\\" and shoves it back down their throat, and no amount of sugar can make that stuff taste good.<BR>  I will be buying several copies to distribute to friends.<BR>  Oh, and thanks to the conservatives who have provided endless whoppers in their little ranting reviews here (\\"Franken provides no sources,\\" etc.). You make Franken's case. Dishonesty is rampant on the right. I read several hundred reviews and in not one instance did anyone point out an error or lie in Franken's book. Pathetic.	2003-09-12

He takes apart the arguments of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and many other conservatives by challenging their own words.  When Mr. Franken actually confronts these individual about what they said, the usual response is negative.  The trip to Bob Jones University is VERY amusing.  Franken did not even bother to hide who he was during the trip.  <br />The best chapter, in my opinion, was the one on Paul Wellstone.  Very moving and a good send off for one of the most influential Democrats.  <br />Obviously, if you read this book, you are, for the most part, a liberal of some kind.  I challenge conservatives to actually read this book, before making a commentary on it.  Many of the reviews from the conservative camp make is OBVIOUS that you did not read this book.  But, then, that was the work of many of the &quot;liars&quot; in this book.  <br />Thanks, Al!  Can't wait for the next book.	2003-09-12

More powerful attacks on the neo-propaganda machine include &quot;What Liberal Media&quot; and &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot;, both more accurate (Mr. Frankens doesn't let the exact facts stand in the way of a good joke), factual, and not nearly as readable (Sorry Mr Alterman).<br />That said, they certainly set up Franken to deal a good public blow to an increasingly arrogant right that has &quot;gotten away with it&quot; so long they've forgotten this isn't a natural law. The fact that Fox, under pressure from Bill O'Reily, actually thought they could sue Al Franken and his publisher on the basis of his using &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; on the cover is an example of just how out of touch with reality the far right has gotten. <br />Al Franken succeeds in puncturing the bombast with facts and humor, of people that would simply scream louder when confronted with facts. He is not only correct, factually, but he is honest, keeping the facts in context. He admits when he was wrong (The chapter on Bob Jones university would *never* have made it to print if a Right wing author did such a thing to a left wing university.) with a refreshing candor.<br />In other words, a refreshing change from people that can't tell obvious forged letters, claim to be independents but are registered republicans, or brag about having 780 footnotes, but actually have page upon pages of endnotes that actually have nothing to do with the claims they make.	2003-09-12

I thought these reviews were supposed to be by people who have read the book. Yet I see a negative review claiming the book is almost entirely UNSOURCED when in fact there are 13 pages containing well over 100 detailed source notes, and another &quot;reader&quot; claims Al's research team is made up entirely of WHITE MALES when I can plainly see in their picture on page 368, THREE FEMALES(yes, unfortunately all white, but maybe that's the best Harvard had to offer). <br />So, from a political moderate who has actually read the book.... <br />Al Franken's new book is funny, and at times it is insightful, illuminating and even vicious. One gets the feeling he has finally taken off the gloves and is ready to get in there and sling it with the best of them. At times  he overstates his case. Like when he catches Bill O'Reilly lying about where he came from, being an independent, the whole Polk/Peabody thing, or catching Ann Coulter lying about her age. These kind of lies, while they may say say something about the individuals' personality, are not that important. The book might be better if he talked more about the really important lies, but it probably wouldn't be as funny. Don't get me wrong. He talks a lot about about the big lies, the statistics designed to deceive, the dirty campaign tricks, the dishonest reporting, etc. <br />Al claims the media does not have a liberal bias, and he makes a decent argument. I disagree with some of his conclusions, but I agree with his contention that news media (left, middle and right) suffer from many other biases that undercut their ability to do a good job of reporting. An example (NOT from Al) is the misleading coverage of Whitewater by The New York Times and Washington Post which, for two papers with a supposedly &quot;liberal bias&quot;, sure did a lot of damage to Clinton. <br />In summary, the book is funny and worth reading. Even though it's target is the right wing media, the lessons are applicable to all. It should be ofvalue to all news viewers to show them the many ways in which they are mislead and deceived, sometimes unintentionally. No one should take what they see and hear from these people at face value.  The book does not have an index, so the targets will have to search for their mentions and might even be forced to read whole sections. Al has challenged them to find factual errors. I hope they try (and cite them if they do). They might learn something.	2003-09-11

Here he does a great job of what should have been done for years: skewering the pretensions and hypocrisies of the Radical Right machine which has seized control of the Republican Party and threatens to stage another coup d'etat in the guise of an election in 2004. Franken pulls no punches.  His targets, whether the repellent Limbaugh or harpy Coulter or even the disgraceful W. himself, are skillfully dissected and revealed for the hypocrites and miserable worms that they are.

DUH! READ THE BOOK!!<br />A team of Harvard scholars researched all this stuff, and Franken does a wonderful job combining tons of stats, quotes, facts & eye-witness accounts into a comprehesive (and comprehendable) book. Also, it's fun to read. Al's a funny guy, you know, if you can follow wit and irony and stuff. <br />But if you're one of the bazillions of unfortunate Americans blinded by conservative propaganda... you're probably fuming by now as you read this, and will fume all the more if you choose to read this book. Why, your little brain will probably begin to self-destruct when you start reading evidence of how you've been lied to & manipulated by leaders you've been too \\"patriotic\\" to question. There, there. Turn on the Fox News Channel, I'm sure you'll start to feel better soon. <br />Moving on... Al sums up the conservative/liberal divide wonderfully in the beginning of his book: conservatives love America the way a 4 year old loves her mommy. Everything mommy does/says is good, and anyone who says anything bad about mommy is bad. Whereas, a liberal's love of country is more like grown-up love, which means \\"actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow...It's why we liberals want America to do the right thing.\\" <br /><applause applause><br />As a citizen who's more than concerned (more like, appalled) at the recent actions of our country's leaders, I appreciate Franken's honest, thoughtful, and thorough exploration of how the Right has been on a ramgage for Big Business and special interest groups, all the while waving the flag of patriotism and viciously attacking anyone who opposes -- or even questions -- their tactics. <br />Finally, this book made me feel funny. Iwas genuinely laughing, while ingesting some seriously disturbing facts. I was angry, yet grateful to have the Right's lies, shady politics, and deliberate public confusions described in black & white (& REFERENCED!) I was gaseous, as well, but that probably had less to do with the book than with the burrito I was eating as I read it.<br />Overall, big kudos to Al Franken.	2003-09-11

I'm not usually classified a \\"Liberal\\" in fact I share a lot of Conservative tendencies on things like taxes. However, unlike a true conservative I've got enough sense to see crap for what it is... and what is spewed by the right wing press and the Bush Administration is that in spades!<br />Franken's new book caught my interest mainly because Fox tried to quash it. Anytime a major network or corporation goes after a book and tries to have it withdrawn or censored it signals to me that there's something there that is VERY important. So, when I found it I bought it... and am I glad I did.<br />Al takes a the scalpel of logic and the chainsaw of truth to America's own Al-Jazeera network - Fox News. In the process he shows us Anne Coulter's hidden contempt for her own readers - she thinks they're idiots (and maybe she's right). He shows us how the Bush Administration could have prevented 9/11 if they hadn't been so busy inventing fake stories about White House vandalism. He shows us the hypocrisy and downright psychotic behavior of Fox pundits like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. Finally, he shows how the Bush Tax Plan was a total joke... not with stories of \\"families\\" but with - gasp - numbers!<br />This is a great book, fun to read, but more than that... important to read. The next time someone starts quoting a Wall Street Journal editorial (notoriously inaccurate) at you... you'll have some ammunition. Al's done what most of wish we had time to do... fact check Fox and show them and their bosses in the Bush Administration as the liars we all know they are.<br />Oh, and Clarence Thomas is handkerchief head for throwing the presidency to his wife's boss.

The same kind of thing happens when you show Democrats a videotape of the Ron Brown funeral where Clinton is yukking it up, catches the camera, and feigns tears. Democrats will swear up and down that's not what happened even when confronted with reality. The problem with Al Franken and most Democrats is that they're not thinkers, more like emotional reactionaries. They just want to &quot;do something&quot; for &quot;the children&quot;. Any decent conservative can dismantle Franken's arguments in about five minutes because like most Democrats, he is afraid of facts. I think Franken did better work as one of the worst Saturday Night Live performers ever. The most hilarious outcome of this book is the &quot;liberals get tough&quot; act.

For any conservatives reading the book, it will be difficult to stomach the fact that it is easier for a comedian to pick apart the Ann Coulters on the right than it is for a Fox News anchor to say &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;.<br />Overall a great book to read for anyone who has ever seen/read Coulter, O'Reilly, Hannity, etc.  Franken spreads himself way to thin in this wide-ranging book, which may lead some to dismiss it.<BR>The reason why I have respect for Franken is that he is willing to come out and say &quot;I am a liberal&quot;, while those he criticizes pretend to be independent.<br />But it does not matter if you are a liberal or conservative, a blatant lie is a blatant lie, and Franken points out that many of these conservatives are getting away with slander, and that sometimes their lies are then repeated in the more mainstream media.<br />Yes, Franken does have an unfair advantage over those he writes of because instead of being vicious, he uses wit to make them seem foolish.<br />But Franken is at his best when he dispenses with the humor and sarcasm to discuss the deeply personal subject of Paul Wellstone's funeral, and how many on the right shamelessly used a senator's death to attack the democratic party.	2003-09-11

In an easily found-on-the-net letter, Al apologizes for fraudulently claiming he had received abstinence stories from people like Condi Rice for his book (a simple google search will turn it up if you're really interested in TRUTH).  Somehow now I find it difficult to take anything Franken says as gospel after that.  In fact, the title of the book is a perfect description of the author.

I read the book on a plane trip from New York to New Orleans and it kept me entertained although I'm rather liberal and it's written for a liberal audience in mind.  It won't entertain people with a conservative leaning ( as evidenced by all the one star reviews here ).  Al Franken is funny when he's picking apart Ann Coulter and Bill O'Rielly.  He's funny when lambasting &quot;HANNITY and combs&quot; and he's funny when recounting his ride on a plane with Barbara Bush.  He's funny while telling the story of how he tried to get the goods on Bob Jones University but instead encountered polite and incorruptible people.<br />He's not so funny when talking about the Wellstone memorial service and that's by design.  It was a pretty serious event for him which he sees as being twisted by the right's spin doctors for their political gain.  Unfortunately there are a couple of cartoons in the book that are not very funny either and that's NOT by design.  Supply Side Jesus is just ascerbic and the Vietnam 'toon was just long.  I hope he didn't write those.<br />One theme that I see the One Star reviewers bringing up as a contradiction is the fact that Al Franken sent a letter to John Ashcroft et. al. on Harvard letterhead as a ruse to get their opinions about abstinance.  I saw one say that it's a well documented Al Franken lie.  Well, you can read all about it IN THE BOOK since that is undoubtedly where the story originates.  <br />READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU REVIEW IT.<br />Is it a classic?  No, but it's funny and kills time on a plane.	2003-09-11

The book is a call to arms to everyone who is appalled by the direction of the Bush administration and its Fox, WSH, Washington Times cheerleaders.<br />The Wellstone Memorial Chapter alone is a searing indictment of viciousness abetted by laziness, in which a heartfelt, grief stricken event was distorted and cynically used as a club in the late stages of the 2002 election. Franken confronts many of the right wing commentators who told lies and are forced to admit they did not see the event they wrote the lies about. Elian/Dolphin girl Peggy Noonan merits particular scorn. <br />Franken's book is a funny &quot;Common Sense&quot; for our times.  Buy it for yourself and especially any &quot;swing voter&quot; with an open mind.  It will unquestionably convince them to vote for the Dems.	2003-09-11

His other books (Why Not Me, Stuart Smalley, etc.) have mostly bombed on the charts, but &quot;Rush Limbaugh...&quot; was a huge hit and Franken's gone back to the trough in &quot;Liars&quot;.  <BR>  A fair comic at best (I saw him on the road with Tom Davis in '83), Franken's big claim to fame is appearing on various talk shows and defending the Clintons and bashing Bush. But, he knows his audience and knows what &quot;boogey-men&quot; the Left fears and satirizes/criticizes them to make a load of cash! <BR>  As to the new book, Fox News is the chief target of the Left now that they've learned they can't stop talk radio.  The disputation of that network is paramount, as any credibility given to it, points out the liberal bias of CNN, ABC, and the others.  Just as talk radio was blamed for the Oklahoma City bombing, Fox will have a big, fat (hehe) target painted on it and &quot;opinion shows&quot; like O'Reilly will be lumped into the regular news reporting, to &quot;prove&quot; that Fox is just a Republican mouth-piece (and dis-proving that CNN is a Democratic one).<BR>  As to the &quot;lies&quot; in his books, most of that is subjective and can be interpreted, but that's not really the point. The point is to make liberals feel better and I'm sure it will do that.	2003-09-11

I first realized this when I got to Germany and had an Army Captain insinuate that I was unpatriotic for reading it. For those who don't like to look things up that they don't understand, 'insinuate' is a not so subtle suggestion. \\"Well...that's your opinion\\" I said, and went back to reading. He was not done with me yet \\"You like Al Franken?\\" he asked. \\"Sure\\" I said \\"but I've never met him\\" (Al, if you read this I'd love to chat sometime...great book!). I really wanted to get back to my book (actually the book Al wrote) but he had one last thing to say to me. \\"What's a person like you doing in the Army?\\"<br />As it turns out, I really am in the Army and have been (Active or Reserve) for the past 14 years. I am currently serving as a Peacekeeper in Bosnia (I was returning from R&R leave), a country where Al Franken once entertained some of our brave troops. I don't enjoy having my patriotism questioned because I have a different opinion than the one put out by certain groups within the United States.

With his keyboard dipped in vitriol, Al Franken hilariously exposes the myth of the liberal media while giving several right-wing clowns enough rope to hang themselves along the way. Unlike all too many members of the vanguard right, who have consistently used spurious statistics or outright lies to make their case, Franken simply allows them to choke on their own deceiving words. And choke they do, from &quot;fiction&quot; author Ann Coulter and Fox News' Sean Hannity to the near psychotic rantings of Bill O'Reilly. In fact, Franken's best stuff is saved for O'Reilly, who, when challenged, acts with all the grace of a rat trapped in a corner and confirms our suspicions about the splotchy parody of himself he has become. Especially illuminating is Franken's well-documented history of America's War on Terrorism-a history that, not surprisingly, bears absolutely no resemblance to the Bush White House version.<BR>Conservatives won't get it, of course, (then again, conservatives won't even read it) but Franken is a highly educated, highly articulate, and extremely funny beacon of hope for the left and a true patriot.<BR>As scathingly funny as &quot;Lies. . .&quot; is, Franken reveals the deeply disturbing backslide our country has taken since the neocons took over.

This complainant felt this was proof positive that the readers giving positive reviews were biased. Well...of course! We're biased in favor of the book, either because we agree with its hypothesis and feel that Mr. Franken successfully and entertainingly demonstrates the truth of his position, or because we come to the book with an open mind and find that Mr. Franken convinces us through force of argument and proof.<br />More to the point, though, I will say the negative reviews--heartfelt, no doubt, even by the reviewers who haven't actually read the book they're criticizing--offer little or no support for their negative reviews. They fail to refute Mr. Franken's argument, but merely call names or dismiss Mr. Franken as a &quot;poor comedian&quot; or a liberal propagandist, or some such thing. This is not helpful.

Franken, while one of the funniest men in the lower forty-eight states, perhaps in all fifty, uses humor in the same way Will Rogers once did: To make very serious points about our politics, our popular culture, and the lying liars who have dominated both for the past decade and almost destroyed our country.  Al, ever irreverent, insoucient and at times side-aplittingly funny, has done his counrty a great service.  This is a funny, funny book.  But what he is writing about is anything but funny.  It is funny in the same way Chaplin's Great Dictator was funny by poking fun at a terribly unfunny group of people.  Perhaps the most unfunny chapter starts on page 104 and details with stark clarity the treasonous malfeasance of George W. Bush and his administration that led unerringly to 9/11 and much that has come since.  A recent Nobel prize-winner in economics made the statement printed first in the German press and given wide circulation in Europe that Geogre W. Bush has been the worst president of the United States of all who have ever held that office.  Franken instructs us in why this is true and how it all came to be.  This is probably the most important book published in 2003, and certainly should be a compulsive read for every Independant and Democratic voter before the 2004 national elections.

Unfortunately, there is no way to know if Franken has his facts straight. Other than a few charts and tables and maybe a few quotes, his book is completely unsourced. He faults Ann Coulter for using endnotes instead of footnotes, and then proceeds to include neither in his own book. That doesn't stop him from making damaging allegations that are impossible to verify, though.<br />Franken also uses his standard \\"comedy\\" defense against his critics. His first book about Limbaugh was a commentary on how mean our politics has become, therefore Franken's meanness was satire. This is a book about lies, so Franken's lies are satire and therefore cannot be criticized.<br />Franken moves back and forth between fact and fiction in this book (there is a long sexual fantasy about Katherine Harris, for example) in a way that undermines his credibility. Also, since he is not particularly funny, it is difficult to tell when he is joking and when he is serious, which is probably what Franken wants (in order to avoid any serious criticism of his book).<br />Although this book is intended as a rebuttal to \\"Slander\\", Franken inadvertantly proves many of Coulter's arguments correct. For example, it is clear from his pornographic portrayal of Katherine Harris that he doesn't like her, but he never tells us why. If he has some problem with her interpretation of Florida election law, he is keeping it to himself. Thus, as Coulter put it, Franken is refusing to engage ideas or make arguments; he is simply smearing people he doesn't like. <br />Of course, Franken would claim it was \\"satire\\".	2003-09-10

Of course everything that Franken talks about is debatable, but he really seems to fall where other liberals have fallen before him.<BR> He is good in the fact that he is active and is willing to put alot of what he says on the line by confronting others in a bold way, but there is two main problems with that in itself. First of all, like Michael Moore, he always uses comedy as an excuse for factual inacuracies and second, is always talking about how other people are so wrong, without backing any of it up with anything positive to hold onto. He often tries to discredit people like Sean Hannity, Bill O' Reilly, and Bush who are already easy targets because they themselves are bold. If Franken really wanted to prove his case the he would challenge them more directly, not just insult them like a child.	2003-09-10

People are beginning to wake up to the steady stream of lies spewed forth by the right-wing nuts and this book will help precipitate the fall of neo-cons into what we can only hope will be permanent exile to the fringes of society where they belong.

Then Ann Coulter comes out with one.  David Horowitz with another.  Then Sean Hannity, then Bernie Goldberg.  Even distinguished journalists like Bob Woodword are going out of their way to pay lip service to President Bush, while the liberals sit back and take charges of treason, lack of patriotism, and communist conspiricies.  It's about time the liberals fought back, and Franken leads the fight with &quot;Lies&quot; a funny and well researched book about how the right has succeeded in smearing America-Loving liberals and good decent men like Al Gore. <br />Take for example Al Gore's supposed claim that he &quot;invented the internet&quot;  Franken cites directly from the CNN Wolf Blitzer transcript the words that made Gore infamous and shows the reader that Al Gore indeed said no such thing and that it was completely blown out of porportion by the supposed &quot;left wing media&quot;  Franken goes onto cite numerous examples of how conservative pundits continue to distort and smear liberals, often resorting to calling dissenters &quot;un-patriotic&quot; and/or &quot;communists&quot;, talking them down on numerous right wing talk shows and reaffirming the beliefs of the millions of conservatives out there.<br />Take for another example the Paul Wellstone memorial which was attacked by right wing pundits all across the country as a political shout down of conservatives trying to pay their respects to the late Senator.  Tucker Carlson of CNN's crossfire went on the air the day after the memorial denouncing it as a political rally having not seen the event himself.  Peggy Noonan showed up on &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot; to claim that &quot;20,000 booed&quot; while actual video of the event confirms that maybe a few dozen boos were scattered throughout the auditorium.  Fox news reported that former Sen. Rudy Boshwitz, then candidate Norm Coleman and former Sen. Rod Grahams were booed but the memorial tapes showthat none of the above were booed at all.  What was to be a touching memorial of a great man was turned into a right wing smear of the left, in typical &quot;liberal media&quot; fashioin.  Gone was the touching words of Wellstone's sons, non-existant was the respects paid by both sides of the aisle to Wellstone.  Instead all the American people heard about were the rude and spiteful liberals who, according to Peggy Noonan, jeered in the ten thousands.<br />Franken has released his book in conjunction with new left wing literature including Joe Conason's &quot;Big Lies&quot; and Hillary Clinton's &quot;Living History&quot;.  Let's hope Franken's book encourages more liberals to speak up becuase lord knows we've been taking it on all fronts since Sept. 11th.  It's time we fought back, and make Al Franken's book one voice in a chorus of voices fighting against the smears and distortions of the right.	2003-09-10

A previous reviewer (who gave only 3 stars) thought this book was more of a morale booster for Democrats than anything else...and he's right.  Somewhat right.  This book is really funny but it also helps bring to light just how ferocious and evil many of the Republican party operatives are.      Al Franken tells it like many elected Democrats wish they could.  He accurately portrays elected Republicans for what many are (not all but very many)-- lying liars who have really perfected the art of using the so-called \\"liberal\\" media to advance their campaigns of lies. Franken rightly concludes with a very simple yet important call to action -- fight Republicans with the truth by throwing the lies back into their face.  The problem is that its a hard concept to stomach when its apparent that Republicans have won many elections since '96 using the the slash and burn campaigns of lies.  We can only hope that as the truth about Republican policies and their failures become more and more apparent and the deficits continue to grow and the jobs continue to go overseas that many independents will acknowledge Democrats as the true protectors of freedom and justice for all -- not just a select few.	2003-09-10

What America needs right now is a pragmatic strategy to fight terrorism, i.e., one that is based on an honest, open-minded analysis of what works and what doesn't.  The cable &quot;news&quot; networks haven't been doing the American people a good service, and I hope that this book will mark the turning point.  I'm hopeful, given the sheer volume of feedback on this book.  &quot;News&quot; TV producers take notice: give us real news and balanced analysis, and get the zealots off the air. <br />Some of the reviewers here are obviously not open-minded enough to read beyond the title of the book.  Those that do keep an open mind however will find that Al Franken's analysis, although extremely personal (and hilarious), is entirely factual.  After reading this book, it just becomes impossible to trust any word coming out of Hannity, O'Reilly, Coulter, and co.  For example, how can you believe ANY statement of &quot;fact&quot; from a man who will lie about where he was raised? (O'Reilly)	2003-09-09

Nearly every one of the facts or inaccuracies described by TeamFranken in this book can be verified using Google, LexisNexis or the old-fashioned library. Of course, the liberal-left will love reading this book. It confirms what outrages many on a daily basis since Bush became president. But  thoughtful Republicans should read it as well. It would be a useful tool to savvy moderates hoping to correct what is causing some to rethink their political affiliation -- militant, supremacist rhetoric. This book hits many nails on the head when it comes to questionable behavior on the part of so-called journalists and politicians.  And in a voice that's not overly scholarly (sorry Al) or muddled with hard-to-check he-said, she-said history that leaves people wondering. The chapters on the Wellstone memorial and affirmative action are excellent. More, Al! More!	2003-09-09

In his latest tome, however, there is much less sprawling of his trademark invective than one might expect from the former SNL comic. For whatever reason, be it that he's trying to appear less anathematic to the right, or whatever else, he tries to paint a more factual picture.<br />Some of his assessments are sensible and true. On the other hand, some of the commentary is just childish and vengeful. You can just see the rabid foaming of his mouth as he writes.  Take for example, Bill O'Reilly; the best Franken could muster up is that he misspoke about winning a Peabody on \\"Inside Edition.\\" This is generally what makes the book difficult and will have you throwing it against the wall. The points make sense, but Franken sometimes make huge leaps to make those points, and the end result is dismal.<br />Franken overplays \\"TeamFranken\\", a bunch of Harvard whiz kids that are supposed to lend credibility to his high-school level arguments and taking things out of context. Bottom line: it's somewhat amusing on a comedic level, and of course to laugh at Franken's sometimes misplaced logic, but the level of discourse rarely reaches high ground... check it out at your library.	2003-09-09

It's a funny (conservatives enjoy humor, right?) and fact-filled book that exposes how folks with a particular agenda bleed that message into the mainstream media.<br />I was particularly interested to read the play-by-play coverage of the Paul Wellstone memorial that I remember was widely criticized in the media as being a political rally. The truth was fascinating  to read as Al Franken traced the \\"political rally\\" spin  as originating from a variety of folks who had not been to the event, and that had a clear conservative agenda.  (Remember Rush Limbaugh? He was involved.) <br />I started the book looking forward to a good laugh. And I laughed. A lot. As I laughed and read about the right wing media, and the conservative White House that is completely politically motivated...I got angry. Very angry. I don't like being lied to. Nor will I sit back and be scared to speak up about my concerns lest I be labeled Un-American.<br />This book provided me with many laughs and a resolve to once again get involved politically.

I could not put this book down.  Franken provides plenty of comic relief and simplifies the most complicated issues for the reader.  Prepare to do research after reading this work...this book leads the reader to go in search of more answers than those it provides.

In this top notch political satire, his wit is on par with Dave Barry. But this book will also enlighten and shock, and has some heartfelt moments as well. Franken is out to demonstrate that the &quot;liberal media&quot; is a myth, and reveals many media outlets (Fox News) to be shamelessly biased toward the right. Franken uncovers countless lies, exposes the &quot;lying liars&quot; who concoct them, and explains how they get away with it. He recounts numerous occasions where he confronts these people. The fact checking is impressive, Franken and his team of 14 researchers seem obsessed with presenting irrefutable facts. If you're not heavily into politics, you'll still enjoy this, the comedy is great even if you've never watched CSPAN or Crossfire. And after finishing (it's a quick read), you'll probably find it much harder for politicians and biased reporters to fool you. Sadly, there are many people whose preconceptions will cause them to hate this book before even opening it.	2003-09-09

His time at Saturday Night Live was during a Great era of the cyclically funny show (about 5 years on/5 years off, IMO.)<br />Having said that, if you've been paying ANY attention to non-partisan media (Roll Call) or the left-side of the Blogosphere (Conansan, MWO, Bartcop, too many others to mention) there's not much new here.  But Franken might be the most entertaining summation of themes of which you should already be aware.  Examples, Coulter names a book SLANDER and proceeds to slander and defame every liberal she names.  Al Gore actually said he fought for legislation to fund research to enhance the internet, and never, as thousands of aired and published stories tell it, said he invented the internet.  O'Reilly claimed to win a Peabody when he didn't and then lied about having said it.  Yes indeed, many of the most popular right-wing media darlings have been caught in mistakes.  But rather than correcting mistakes, Franken shows examples of those mistakes being either denied or defended so vehementally by their defenders they can only cross over into the word lies.  If one continues to insist that what you say is true, even when it is proven to be absolutely untrue, then you are lying.<br />No real new ground here but he's still a funny guy.  Easily the most entertaining re-hash the work of Alterman, Brock and others which is a good thing.  If you struggled through &quot;Big Lies&quot; or &quot;What Liberal Media&quot; but their themes appeal to you, this is your book.  <br />Finally, why on Earth would anyone review a book by suggesting that Franken's parents should have aborted him?  What exactly does that add to political debate?	2003-09-09

This book is so intelligently written in every respect--research, wit, style, and insight.  Franken demonstrates PRECISELY how certain right-wingers are able to pull the wool over the eyes of people who are too lazy to really find out the facts.  <BR>The most awesome example of this can be seen right here via a review by &quot;tropical alex&quot; who rails on Franken for misquoting Ann Coulter about Evan Thomas'es relation to Norman Thomas. Unbeknownst to &quot;tropical alex&quot; Franken does this INTENTIONALLY TO PROVE THE POINT THAT PEOPLE DON'T READ ENDNOTES. SEE PAGE 379, TROPICAL! Franken shows how Coulter can lie and distort the truth in the main text of her book, &quot;Slander,&quot; by burying relevant notes in the back of the book--knowing that people like Tropical Alex will only look so far. IT IS EASY TO LIE TO LAZY PEOPLE. Is the point crystal now, Tropical? Don't feel too bad though, I'm sure there are many liberals that missed that one too.<BR>Only astute people with a sense of humor should apply for readership of this book (witness the negative reviews of this book and wonder how far any of those readers got).<BR>Kudos across the board for Al and TeamFranken!	2003-09-09

His book is funny but more importantly his facts check out. There are a few things which seem rather nit-picky (like Dick Cheney mentioning \\"crosses row after row\\" in describing his many vists to Arlington Cemetary. Arlington does not have crosses but simple rectangular stones)and sometimes he may extropolate more from a personal anecdote than the evidence would really warrant (such as his encounter with Barbara Bush which he details in the the book)but the book holds up quite well, and the sheer VOLUME of annotated and proven distortions, omissions and outright lies by the the conservative media takes on a weight of its own. He DOES prove that people like Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly are liars (not to mention GWB) and he does it in a funny way. Conservatives will hate this book but they won't be able to find anything that isn't true.	2003-09-09

Just make sure to read the next book pointing out the &quot;lies&quot; in Franken's book:  after all, Franken says he put pictures of the liars on the cover of his book . . . and look who's picture is the biggest.<br />  But hey, 2 stars for successfully baiting O'Reilly and Fox into suing, and a successful marketing campaign to the faithful.	2003-09-09

The fact that this neo-con group has gotten away with lies and distortions that make Clinton's look like 5th grade recess is down right infuriating.  We can thank Al and his stalwart Harvard researchers - Team Franken - for diving into many issues and some frivolities to reveal what actually happened or what was actually said.

This investigation into the perverse manner by which extremists have hijacked public discourse is a bit sad because Al Franken lampoons behaviors that clearly illuminate the destructive impulses of the so-called conservatives.  Hmm...I guess my age is showing when I think of Republican conservatives as people like Rockefeller, Weichert or those in the Ripon Society.<br />When one looks beyond the humor that Al Franken brings to the subject, what he discusses is alarming.  More than that, once awakened to the mendacious (aka lying) ways of the people who seem to believe that they have the pipeline to the truth, I feel that they have stolen our democracy.  After reading this book I am more aware of how Son of Bushlips distorts the truth and brandishes the flag to conceal his shortcomings and those of the conservatives who support him.<br />Al Franken's book is a real page turner with biting humor that doesn't let up.	2003-09-09

He's at his best when he examines the media and the right-wing mouthpieces that serve it. Most important observation in the book is how the Right creates an inflammatory story (the Al Gore examples are priceless), repeats it and watches to see which (lazy) media conglomerates (ABC, CBS, NBC, take your pick) decides to report it. Then, if they don't, the Right screams, &quot;Liberal bias.&quot; It's a win-win game for them, as a result. The Wellstone chapter is heartbreaking. Everybody knows Coulter is evil and Hannity is just insane, but I honestly expected more from people like Jeff Greenfield at ABC. What few people fail to mention in the inane negative reviews of the book posted here is how respectful Franken is to Republicans who behave themselves and actually take the time to recognize the lies and hypocritical stances -- people like Gary Bauer, John McCain. I look forward to sharing this book with as many people as possible. And I look forward to reading the books by the opposing sides of Franken's argument, as well -- but from the library.<br />Most of my Republican friends are embarrassed by Ann Coulter's behavior, thankfully. They recognize the mean-spirited, self-serving behavior behind her rhetoric (and her ENORMOUS Adam's apple -- has anyone else noticed that?). <br />Thanks, Al.	2003-09-09

Some of the examples of the far-right that he provides are so extreme that they become comical.  Bill O'Reilly saying \\"Shut up\\" over and over reminds me of a first-grader in a school yard that's losing an argument.<br />Get this book, skim (or ignore as I did) the two questionable chapters (comic book style and Vietnam fiction), and you'll be very happy with your purchase.	2003-09-09

But Franken does a great job documenting the fact that propagation of &quot;The Big Lie&quot; still works effectively.  The only thing I think he misses is that The Big Lie works not because we believe it, but because we're tired of trying to sort out fact from fiction.  We surrender!  Which is what makes it nice when someone helps us do the sorting (certainly the so-called liberal media never bother).<br />I was going to give this only four stars until I noticed that the same reviewer (from CHICAGO, IL) kept posting the same one-star review over and over to get the average rating down.

It was public knowledge he did this to John Ashcroft, amongst others. <br />Look, Franken, unable to get his information legally, and finding no truthful information that will advance his Leninist agenda, will lie and make it up. Franken already issued an apology for doing this to Ashcroft and others. Like Linus Pauling said: I am not interested in your fantasies about experiments, I am interested in only one thing: What would the data lead us to believe? <br />And the data tells us Franken is the liar.

Anyone who disputes that any facts in the book are false has to be a partisan hack.  He does have his own opinions in the book.  A reasonable person could disagree with some of his opinions.  It's laughable how many closed minded partisans will claim the book is a bunch of liberal lies when they cannot disprove a single fact.  These right wing reviewers here probably haven't bought or read the book. They're too cheap.  They have probably gotten all their info on the book from O'Lielly.

I just love the unpredictability of his humor and his ability to hit you out of the blue with wonderful uncensored raunch. But the book devastates the right. By reading the odd vapid review posted here by right-wingers (who clearly haven't even read it) one would think they are dumbstruck. Why no substantive rebuttal's to any points made? I would love to see some substance instead of the blather.<BR>   I will be buying several copies to distribute to friends. I offered to buy a copy for an acquaintance that likes Bush and is an O'Reilly fan, but he declined by pretending that he wouldn't want to look to \\"a comedian\\" for his information. To bad. The real reason is he \\"doesn't like to read books\\" and his testes retract when he thinks about having to turn FOX (and other sources) off long enough to read a substantive response to his right wing faith. But he did inform me that I should remember that Bush is a \\"compasionate[sic] conservitve[sic].\\" Oh my.<BR>   I thought Franken's Chicken Hawk story was the weakest part humor-wise but his main point here is a good one. A surprising number of hawks on Team Bush took a pass when it came time possibly face war themselves. I loved the Supply Side Jesus cartoon. The \\"Waitress and the Lawyer\\" play was excellent. The 15 or so pages showing how Bush dropped the ball on terrorism before 9/11 are probably the most disturbing. I already knew most of it from an article in TIME mag., but Al and his team put it together in a very powerful and concise way. Not nearly enough is said about how the incredible incompetence of Bush's team left America open to the 9/11 attack. I think we don't hear much about this because people think it might appear as unpatriotic and Americans just don't want to contemplate that they might have a president that in this important area, was this incompetent. And of course, sadly, there is nothing we can do about it now. Rather depressing really but it needs to be said, and Franken knocks it out of the park. If you are going to be disgusted with the facts, you might as have a little humor along with the medicine.<BR>   And that's what this book is, medicine for a nation drunk on endless streams of blatant distortion, lies and effluent put forward by the likes of Hannity, Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Coulter and Team Bush. The humor is the sugar that helps it go down. But the right-wing faithful are still going to gag, should they read it. And with good reason. Franken takes their \\"geysers of liquefied pig feces\\" and shoves it back down their throat, and no amount of sugar can make that stuff taste good.	2003-09-09

I'm sorry, I don't find the minute details of the lies of Republican crackpots very interesting.  What sane person would take them seriously in the first place?  And who cares if one of them doesn't know the difference between footnotes and endnotes?  This is a book about the honesty of conservative loud mouths, not their intelligence.  (He already established that Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot; now we are talking about his veracity.)<br />Although I think Cheney is probably the Antichrist, I don't think it's exactly a hanging offense to call gravestones, crosses (row on row).  I'd say he was extremely insensitive to religions other than his own, but I wouldn't put it in the Horrible Lie category.<br />I don't really care about the clever way Franken, the Harvard graduate and fellow, one-ups a nameless moron who sent him nasty email.  I would care more about an investigation of Governor Bush's questionable National Guard record and his spin on it.  And why there were so many more major stories on Clinton's \\"draft dodging\\" than Bush's AWOL/desertion period. <br />I think I would like the book more if Franken had stuck to his subject and given me more.  It isn't a very thick book to begin with and a lot of it is filler (funny, but filler).	2003-09-09

A good lesson I've learned (forgive me, I'm slow) is to check facts before believing sensationalism.  I've enjoyed 'expose' books about the left and the right (I refuse to label myself as either because I think, like most americans probably do, that there are good points on both sides).  But an error I've made is to believe what is written for the most part, because I actually had faith that publishers do fact-checking before printing something.  Now, I understand that anecdotes usually are unprovable, but quoted facts and figures are.<br />So, when someone like Al Franken goes to the trouble to check facts and figures and finds that recent bestselling authors (and/or their ghostwriters) mis-quote, lie, and do other slimely things in print, I am ashamed for the publishing world.<br />Not that publishers and the media are saints, but I actually had some faith that they tried to be truthful.  And when a fact is found to be false, they admit it.  But my faith is shattered.<br />The American way blesses those like Al Franken who expose this stuff.  Plus, he does it with a razor sharp wit.  It is no wonder that this little guy is causing so much anger amongst the right wing group.  They can't blow off being proven as liars.  He should now write a book exposing the lies of the left's sensationalists.	2003-09-08

So, a challenge:  to you conservatives out there...the ones that think the sun rises and sets on Rush's and O'Reilly's and Coulter's and Hannaty's and Bush's shoulders...you wanna see some real truth?  Read this book if you have any spine at all.  You wanna learn how it was actually Clinton's military that did so well against the war on terrorism? Do you care that the stories of the departing Clinton staffers trashing the White House were lies, complete and total fabrications?  Do you want the truth about how Max Cleland, a brave and patriotic American who left three of his limbs in Viet Nam, was trashed by right wing bigots?  You wanna see some real facts, with no spin?  No, of course you don't.  Silly question.  It takes so much less thought and reason to believe the blowhards, gutless bullies and name callers that Franken spotlights.  So you are the real gutless wonders out there if you don't have the nerve to buy and read this book...and try to disprove any of it.  I dare you.<br />Thank you Al Franken...finally, what a breath of fresh air!  Liberals out there...buy this book...you do have a voice!

I'm delighted to see that Al's book is a MAJOR success and that others (like Joe Conason's new book and Jim Hightower's new one) are climbing the bestseller lists.<br />The Bush Administration and the radical Right (see Faux, I mean FOX News, etc.) has repeatedly lied to us all, and it's time to set the record straight and make some noise.<br />Thanks for the amazing book, Al (although the fictitious Vietnam story went on a bit long for my tastes...).

O'Reilly's claims of journalistic credibility, Coulter's insane rantings, Hannity's bombast.  Especially telling were his answers to the outlandish accusations against Bill Clinton and Al Gore by various conservatives.  Basically, their claims lack any shred of proof or misstate events while Al provides direct quotes and names of sources in refutation.  Good stuff.<br />My only criticism would be his occasional lapses into parody in the midst of a solid argument.  The Bush administration, in its blind hatred of all things Clinton, failed to follow up on intelligence pointing to attacks by Al Qaeda. But to refer to it by an operational name without identifying the name as parody (unless there really was such an operation) could cause those from the dark side to question his credibility.<br />All in all, buy or borrow this book, but definitely read it.	2003-09-08

And you know what? All the bad reviews on here point out that Franken stoops to name calling and 6th grade debate quality...yet that is what the review itself is doing. The right is very hipocritical when they attempt to shoot down their opponents. It's sad to realize that the only thing that keeps the right going is the love of the almighty dollar. Nobody cares if the world goes to hell, as long as they can have their money...which is what is happening today.

Particularly engaging is Franken's list of ways to &quot;Lie with footnotes&quot; that he pulls from Ms. Coulter's book &quot;Slander&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, the book trails off after the first 200 pages.  The points Franken makes in the last several chapters are less clearly defined and the jokes become less cutting.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the book's realease date was pushed up to take advantage of FOX NEWS' frivolous lawsuit against Franken.<br />I do doubt that anyone that anyone who comes to this book from a conservative background will appreciate the arguments Fraqnken presents.  This is not because the argumentsd are invalid, but rather that Franken's attitude is a bit smug and superior.  This is amusing to a reader with liberal leanings (like me), but I think that those ont he other side of the spectrum will turn off pretty quickly.	2003-09-08

Deep down most Americans know that this Administration has, and continues to &quot;shape the facts&quot; to advance it's numerous right wing agendas. Is calling the President a liar unpatriotic if he has proven to be one over and over again? I don't think so. Except for the occasional editiorial here and there I don't see many others in the media willing to point out the many discrepancies between the truth and the propaganda that the public is spoon feed by the corporate owned media. This book made me laugh and also gave me hope that there might be more like minded liberals out there than I knew about. Toward the end you say &quot;Truth to power, baby&quot;, and that's what this book really turns out to be.	2003-09-08

It should not matter which side of the political aisle you are on; if you are a Democrat you should be outraged at how so many lies have been made against your party.  If you are a republican you should be outraged at how your pundits poorly researched their claims, and instead resorted to \\"fact by repetition\\".<br /><br />An example from the book; Ann Coulter used as an example of 'liberal' media the fact that Evan Thomas' father, Norm Thomas,  ran for President as a socialist four times.  Evan Thomas is bureau chief for Newsweek.  Franken uses this lie to hilariously discredit Coulter.  You see, it turns out that Norm Thomas isn't Evan's father at all.  To add insult to injury it turns out that Norm Thomas ran for President six times not four.<br /><br />Now my question.  Given the breadth of deception, lies, and hypocricy demonstrated by the right's pundits I find myself wondering why there hasn't been a major investigation into the whole deal?  Is it just so expansive that there is too much to take on, or is it (as Franken would say) that the mainstream media is just too lazy?<br /><br />Overall, a great read that had me laughing out loud more than a few times.	2003-09-08

Franken is an avowed liberal, but this book is not about policy, it's about honesty and the larger question, &quot;What do we want our media and political system to be about?&quot;  Do we want a significant portion of our media operating as if it's a wholly-owned subsidiary of one political party?  Do we want lies regarding issues of public import to go uncovered?  Do we want politicians to feel secure from the prying eyes of scrutiny?  Regardless of whether these facts give the advantage to your favorite political party or not, I hope the answer is &quot;NO&quot;.  <br />This book details some very serious lapses in honesty and fairness that were created by a right-wing media establishment and perpetuated by our lazy, if well-meaning mainstream media.	2003-09-08

While Franken is often thought of as a humorist, his political commentary is biting.  He has written some things that has needed to be said.<br />Franken dissolves the myth of the Liberal media bias through his research.  This research is the element that all the conservative attacks on the democratic party lack.  Franken's writing on Bill O'Reilly and the Fox network exposes it as a less then truthful news source.  His attacks on Bush and the Bush Adminstration should scare any intelligent reader.  The administration has been a sham from the beginning.  The book is also full of laughs including a test on &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; and &quot;Supply Side Jesus&quot;.<br />I am truly glad Franken said a lot of things that needed to be said in this book.  I hope that this book is strong enough to fight the less than truthful conservative media and remove Bush from the White House in 2004.	2003-09-08

Other than being a well-researched, honest account of the endangered species known as 'fair and balanced' U.S. media, Al Franken's \\"Lies\\" exposes how many Americans are easily led to nonsense. The lies repeatedly spewed by Coulter, O'Reilly and the Fox News ilk (shamelessly headed by Uber Aussie Rupert Murdoch and right-winger Roger Ailes) should be ridiculed and shamed, not bought into blindly. Once the misled Americans wise up and begin thinking critically, they can start the long overdue boycot of everything Fox and take our country back.	2003-09-08

I'm off to a slow start as I've only done it once so far.  Well, twice if you include the \\"fair and balanced\\" in the first sentence there.  And three times if you include that one.  See how easy it is?  I encourage everyone to start using it as much as possible.  With Fox fighting all these lawsuits, maybe Rupert Murdoch will eventually go broke!<br />Okay, let's clear up some misconceptions about \\"Lies (And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them) A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\\" -- those misconceptions propagated mainly by the one-star reviews written by people who obviously did not read the book.  The book is not about proving conclusively a conservative bias in the media as a whole.  Here, Franken makes a two-pronged argument.  First, that there is a well-funded portion of media that does indeed have a conservative bias and that by their repeating lies over and over again, eventually some of it seeps through to the mainstream media.  Franken's second point is that \\". . . there are other, far more important, biases in the mainstream media than liberal or conservative ones.\\"  Like the \\". . . bias toward the Sensational, involving Scandal, and hopefully Sex or Violence. . .\\" or the Easy-and-Cheap-to-Cover, Get-It-First, Pack Mentality, Negativity, Soft News, Don't-Offend-the-Conglomerate-That-Owns-Us, Hoping-There's-a-War-to-Cover biases.  To name a few.  The poignant chapter on the Paul Wellstone memorial is a good case study of how the conservative media is able to exploit these ingrained biases in order to propagate their lies.<br />The point of the book is also not to be an all-encompassing catalog of the lies of the Right.  Early on, Franken says he made the observation to a friend that going after Ann Coulter is like shooting fish in a barrel.  To which his friend replied, \\"I've never shot fish in a barrel.  But I could imagine that after a while it could get boring.\\"  So, Franken's goal is to illuminate with representative examples in order to reveal the bigger pattern.  Take, for example, Bill O'Reilly's repeated claim that Inside Edition won two Peabody Awards which turned out to be one Polk Award the show won a year after O'Reilly left Inside Edition.  \\"So he made a mistake!  Big deal,\\" you say.  Well, aside from the fact that he repeated this misstatement (ironically, about a journalism award) several times in order to give Inside Edition -- and, by extension, O'Reilly himself -- the veneer of respectability, it was his crybaby reaction to being corrected that's so telling.  Instead of simply admitting that he made a mistake, he used his own show as a soapbox and said he never made any claims about a Peabody and that, therefore, he was the victim of \\"attack journalism.\\"<br />In addition to outright lies, Franken tackles duplicity and hypocricy found in rants from the Right.  Take the following two quotes, for example.<br />1.\\"They haven't prepared for anything in this. And they're running out of weapons to do it. And frankly, I don't think [the President] has the moral authority or ability to fight this war correctly.\\"<br />2.\\"You don't have to take cheap political partisan shots at the commander in chief and say to the world that he doesn't have the experience to lead when he is leading men and women into harm's way.\\"<br />That second quote is from Sean Hannity on March 27, 2003, and it sounds kinda like he's refuting that first quote there, doesn't it?  Except that the first quote is also Sean Hannity, on May 10, 1999, in reference to the war in Kosovo.  You know, when Clinton was leading men and women into harm's way.<br />Perhaps I've not convinced you yet of the brilliance of Al Franken?  Of the fair and balanced nature of the arguments in the book?  Well then I'd like to close with one last quote from the book -- some sage words from a man even stalwarts of the Nutty Right (yes, even Ann Coulter) have no grievance with.  That's right, I'm talking about Mr. Sneer himself, Dick Cheney: \\"A commander in chief leads the military built by those who came before him.  There is little that he or his defense secretary can do to improve the force they have to deploy.  It is all the work of previous administrations.  Decisions made today shape the force of tomorrow. . .\\"  Of course, Cheney made the comments in August 2000. He continues on, saying he called up Ronald Reagan to thank him personally for the military that won the first Gulf War.  And that's why we've been so inundated with nonstop coverage of Cheney's public declarations of gratitude to Bill Clinton.  Especially with this liberal media.	2003-09-08

This is a book that is both dead-accurate and riotously funny.  For Franken, the words &quot;fair and balanced&quot; are more than a catchy phrase to be trademarked and sued over.  If you can get past the first twenty pages and *still* believe that Ann Coulter is a respectable journalist - well, there's just no getting through to you.  No sacred cow of the right is spared: Goldberg, Hannity, O'Reilly - well, maybe Limbaugh (but then again, Al has already covered him quite nicely in a previous book).  Don't &quot;misunderestimate&quot; Franken, or dismiss him as less-than-capable of the formidable task of dismantling the disinformation machine of the right wing - this book is thoroughly and exhaustively researched, and it's also funny as hell.  I'll take truthful and funny over mean-spirited and dubious anyday.<br />But I wouldn't ask you to take my word for it.  I've read a review from a conservative in Greensboro who says he &quot;hates to admit it&quot; but Franken is right about the poor research and misinformation coming from the pundits from his own party - and I've read a review from a conservative &quot;Top 1000 Reviewer&quot; in Colorado who denigrates the book as &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;unreadable&quot;.  I have to wonder if he and I are reading the same book.  But let's see...I could be right!  After all, his music reviews are detailed and well-thought-out.  So why such a generalised, poorly-worded &quot;review&quot; of this book?  Seriously, Jan, I trust your taste in music and I respect the opinion of anyone who likes Captain Beefheart.  Tell you what, if you're willing to go back and actually *read* this book, I'll be willing to swallow my bile and sit down and read Michael Savage (whom, unlike you, I've actually *heard* on the radio), and we can come back and compare notes.

Unlike many authors from the left or the right, his book is backed up by serious research and presentation (not misrepresentation) of facts. He points out what methods people from the right use to lie to their audience. He provides a lie detector for his readers to use. That he is willing to do so shows that he is confident that his own book will pass the lie detector test. Let the intelligent reader be the judge. Take the paragraph on using graphs for example. He presents data, and uses it to draw two graphs. One graph is honest, and the other is misleading. He then pokes fun at Wall Street Journal by pointing out (correctly) that the latter is exactly what WSJ would use. Obviously Paul Krugman has given him a good lesson on this subject. Those interested in learning about how to lie with statistics and graphs, Paul Krugman's \\"The Accidental Theorist\\" is an excellent reference.<br />Still there are drawbacks. He at times overuses the tactic employed by his opponents: name calling, lying (then using a footnote, or worse, endnote to retract it), etc.  For a person who has not read Coulter or O'Reilly, this may seem especially appalling. The paragraph poking fun at O'Reilly softcore porno novel is a bit of a stretch. It would also have been better if there had been an index at the end of the book. People can then easily find where, when, and how each liar lied about what. I suppose this is due to the unexpectedly earlier release date. This should be corrected when the paperback is out.	2003-09-07

I disagreed with some of the conservative pundits but it never occurred to me that the facts they were using to support their stances could have been fabricated, misused or taken drastically out of context.<br />During the publicity tours for this book, Franken repetedly touted the amount of research that went into the book. As far as research goes, it wouldn't take much to one up &quot;You're Smart Enough...&quot;, but this book goes to the source of the habitual lies disseminated by the media unlike any other book I've read. Transcripts of &quot;Hannity and Colmes&quot; and the &quot;The O'Reilly Factor&quot; to illustrate where the lie was first told and how the liar came up with the lie. Often another transcript excerpt presents an instance in which the liar lied about having lied.<br />If there is one weakness in the book it is one pointed out by Franken himself in the introduction: it is sometimes difficult to differentiate joke from fact. Some of the truths in the book are so outrageous it is difficult to believe them until one actully looks up the source from the &quot;Sources and Notes&quot; section. After criticizing Ann Coulter for her crafty use of endnotes it would be helpful to have a system which cited sources as they were used rather than simply listing them in the back, but descriptions along with the websites and newspaper articles listed there do make it fairly easy to find the source of the information.<br />Although he does not keep any of his beliefs secret, fortunately most of the book is used to dispell myths from the right rather than to promote Al Franken's personal opinion. Many on the right will criticize his method for doing nothing to promote bipartisanship. But when public support for one side is based on a set of lies that have been repeated enough times to be believed there is nothing democratic about the argument.<br />I sincerely hope we will see more from Al and the rest of TeamFranken. It is amazing that figures such as Bill O'Reilly are able to hold positions of such high influence when they have such grave issues with telling the truth. Since Fox News clearly doesn't have an interest in promoting truth, I hope enough people read this book to force the industry to make such figures accountable for what they say.	2003-09-07

Information presented as factual is either treated as an opinion or repeated as accurate without anyone bothering to try to confirm it.  For example, when Al Gore mentioned that he was the model for the main character in Love Story, he was ridiculed by two reporters and the rest of the media took up the cry.  Why didn't someone call Erich Segal the author and just ASK - the author says he WAS.

They have grown so accustomed to their regularly scheduled spoon-feedings of misinformation and partisan opinion disguised as journalism that they COULDN'T read this book.  It would completely destroy their worlds.<br />So as a public service to those poor souls who like to think themselves politically clever because they tolerate the likes of Hannity and O'Reilly, let me sum it up for you:<br />Franken (to The Vast Right-Wing Media and Political Apparatus) - \\"On such-and-such a date after such-and-such event, you claimed that such-and-such Democrat (invariably Clinton or Gore) either DID or DIDN'T do something that brought about the eventual downfall of everything that is good and decent in America, is that correct?\\"<br />The Vast Right-Wing Media and Political Apparatus - \\"Yes, that is correct.\\"<br />Franken - \\"Did you actually happen to SEE or HEAR the specific event as it took place, or do any RESEARCH to back up your claims that everything is so-and-so's fault?\\"<br />The Vast Right-Wing Media and Political Apparatus - \\"No, we didn't.\\"<br />Franken - \\"I took the liberty of doing all the research that you refused to do.  Do you know what I found?  Nine times out of ten you report on events through second-hand news, often elaborating incidences and misrepresenting those involved to twist the events to the advantage of your own personal and political (and OFTEN financial) gain.  You take advantage of people who trust in you to bring them honest reporting or to run this country in a manner that upholds the best interests of this country.  You are profiting off the business of misinforming those who look up to you to tell the truth.  What do you have to say to that?\\"<br />The Vast Right-Wing Media and Political Apparatus - \\"Well, uh... we uh...\\"<br />Franken - \\"One final question... why do you lie?\\"<br />The Vast Right-Wing Media and Political Apparatus - \\"We have to leave for a very important meeting, now.\\"<br />Aren't I a nice liberal?  I even saved you the trouble of having to pretend that you know what this fantastic book's about as you write your one-star review. Consider yourself 99% more informed than your other fellow sheep under the intellectual thumb of your beloved conservative pundits (i.e. brainwashers).<br />America is slowly waking to the fact that those currently in office haven't entirely been on the level with us and that perhaps the media is somewhat to blame (as is our own unwillingness to demand integrity from those who bring us the news or those officials whom we elect into office).  That the partisan regime who vilified Clinton and Gore for every day of their tenure in office have rallied around a President with a history of drug and alcohol abuse, who went AWOL at a time of war from the National Reserve post set up for him by his dad, and with a laundry list of questionable business associates is particularly telling of their hypocrisy.  That they have managed to sell George W. Bush to Americans as a paragon of morality and integrity says quite a bit about the level to which we have collectively sunk as a society.<br />In _Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them_, Franken decisively shoves the right's blatant lies back in their faces, rubbing their noses in their own misinformation and exposing their intellectual heroes (I use the term loosely) as the fakirs they are.  He examines how the blame-game played by conservatives has seriously undermined America's integrity both at home and abroad.  No one is fair game: officials lying about policy, journalists \\"tweaking\\" stories to appeal to a certain audience, American citizens spending their hard-earned money on screeds by millionaire pundits filled with cooked statistics and misleading, non-researched material - all of which forms a sort of trickle-down idiocy.<br />Franken calls up many well-worn examples public deception, but with a twist:  he actually RESEARCHES the incidences and uses these amazing things called FACTS to highlight the  actions of our political and media figures.  Maybe it'll catch on?  There are also some truly stunning revelations brought forth in Lies, such as the truth behind the right's blame of Clinton for the 9-11 tragedy and a little man named Mansoor Ijaz who, having failed to sell Osama bin Laden to the US on behalf of a very non-involved Sudanese government, is now on the Fox News Channel's payroll as foreign affairs and terrorism analyst.  It's nice to know that he's not going hungry.<br />Franken has monster cojones to stand up to the lying liars who have driven this country into the ground.  His honesty, research, razor-sharp wit and punchy prose make this one of the most important books written in our generation.  It, and he, will no-doubt be maligned by the right using every tactic that Franken outlines in this work (lies, equivocation, blame-shifting, false statistics, blatant idiocy, denial, more lies).  Each time they do, they prove our case a thousand times over.  I can only hope that the slew of books written this year against the right-wing propaganda and self-interest machine will do something to change the discourse in this country.  Each time I am accused of \\"hating my country\\" or even being guilty of treason, I realize that THEY are the ones who are really weakening our nation.  They attack Americans, smearing anyone who disagrees with them or gets in their way, and it's about time someone called them on it.<br />We need to get smarter about the events taking place around us and start caring more about our country and fellow Americans again.  This book is a good way to start.  It will also give you fresh breath and make you more attractive to women.  Nope, sorry... like Sean \\"I Know Eleven Things\\" Hannity's _Let Freedom Ring_, that last part was also chock full of lies.<br />The only thing this book can't explain, and that I still desperately want to know, is... what IS wrong with Ann Coulter anyway?  The poor, poor woman.ption, but with a twist:  he actually RESEARCHES the incidences and uses these amazing things called FACTS to highlight the  actions of our political and media figures.

His is a passionate and moral plea for the preservation of reasoned political discourse in our nation. The Right has aggressively set about to destroy our multi-party system by poisining the well of free speech. Franken makes a brilliant case that the Right is, at its root, undemocratic. The book is well researched, and hilarious. It is a mistake to read Franken's effort as 'just the same name calling, etc.' In fact and intent, he tries to demonstrate how ugly and debased the greatest nation on earth will become, and how trivialized our Constitution, should our precious right of free speech   decline into lie, deceit, and false witness. Bless Al Franken.	2003-09-07

My bias aside, this is definitely at the top of my current events/politcal books.  I love the way Franken points out errors the right has made and back it up with facts.  Lots of footnotes, not endnotes.  I didn't just sit through years of college writing term papers for various courses with each professor's own preference in research styles--MLA, APA, AMA, Turabian, and Chicago--to discover the truth about some television journalists/writers and their so called facts!  Even in high school, we were not allowed to lie in MLA and APA style research term papers.  We were graded heavily on whether our facts were valid or not.<br />And I agree with how he describes Fox News.  I try to be objective and watch all media, &quot;liberal&quot; or otherwise, but everytime I put on FNC, I hear O'Reilly yelling at some guest.  The guest doesn't even have a chance to defend himself!  That is not &quot;fair and balanced.&quot;  But this book is.  Franken doesn't come right out and defend his fellow Democrats, he points out lies we have been fed.  And remember, with facts.  <br />My other favorites: Works by Michael Moore &amp; Greg Palast, Feminine Mystique, Nickel and Dimed, Fast Food Nation.	2003-09-07

There was even a group catharsis from participation in the large scale purchasing of this book with the publicity engendered by the Fox/Faux News lawsuit.  You know, someone won out not only in court, but in the old marketplace of ideas.<br />Franken's book doesn't offer that much more to an aging sixties (or was it seventies?) generation member.  Just look at the list of recommended authors and related books this website offers.  While a minority viewpoint in the bookstores here in South Carolina (and I assume even in New York), it's not like it can't be found.  The information is not new to me.  However, my 17 year old son found tons of information new to him.  He took it to study hall every day; I had harbored vague hopes of being the first to review this book.  But besides catharsis, I hope this book can help educate a new generation, which gets its news information so much from humorists.<br />The catharis did not stop with the purchase, or with the title, or with the funny introduction, but is maintained throughout the book.  Not every moment, but more than you typically find in political humor.  It's the style that differentiates this book--Franken's willingness to get down in the dirt and fight the right wing on its own unfair and unbalanced terms.  But always with a wink, so that his irony is labeled irony; he claims to be a comedian, not a politician, not a journalist.  As the right wing media does.  For the reader, it's a bit like watching mud wrestling, a guilty pleasure.<br />The book does have its surprisingly humble moments.  There are two (and I believe that is the final tally) issues about which Franken confesses to having been wrong.  I'd rather not spoil the moments by going into detail.  As it is, those moments add substance and nuance to what otherwise would mostly be a long rant.<br />Mostly, of course, it's a long rant.  And for that, I say, &quot;Thanks, I needed that.&quot;	2003-09-07

Doubly so because its coming from Al Franken, since humor is often the best tool to communicate to the masses. I was even happier when the idiots at Fox sued Franken, because there's nothing better than free publicity from your enemy.<br />What I wasn't expecting was such a powerful book. I expected the sort of polemic that warms the hearts of the faithful but brings more passion than logic to the table. Thankfully, I was wrong. Al Franken literally did his homework in this tome, and I think he owes a good deal of thanks to &quot;TeamFranken&quot;, the Harvard kids who helped him research it. Yes, research.<br />Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair &amp; Balanced Look At The Right uses fact and humor in a perfect mesh to systematically deconstruct the falsehoods holding up the Bush team. It helps that Al comes from what I call the Begala-Carville school of political strategy, in which the tepid response of a token like Alan Colmes is as open for derision as the most ludicrous right-winger. Al realizes that these battles are fought in the media, where conservatives use their network to shuffle concepts into the mainstream - it starts in the thinktanks, moves to talk radio and out onto cable news where it gains respectability among the masses - no matter how stupid it may be.<br />And a lot of it is stupid.<br />It's safe to say that this is the only book around that uses charts to show exactly how dishonest folks like Sean Hannity are. Not to mention Ann Coulter and her cavalcade of idiocy.<br />One of the most important chapters is Franken's exhortation that no matter how much we may want to pass of this administration's fulminations as the work of lackeys, George Bush is the man behind it all. Karl Rove, Donald Rumsfeld, Richard Perle, and the rest all answer to one man - and it is he that must shoulder the blame.<br />The last few months have seen some excellent work from the left come out on the printed page, but I have to say Lies And The Lying Liars (along with Joe Conason's Big Lies) are the ammo of choice in the upcoming domestic war. Read them, now.	2003-09-07

He is one of the very few with journalistic access to a wide audience who has actually undertaken the effort to fact check the outrageous claims made by any number of right leaning ideological zealots who seem to dominate our national political discourse. I applaud his efforts, and thank him profusely. But it begs the question. Why does it take a gifted humourist like Franken to get out the truth? Where are the journalists? The reporters? I would think that most of the lies that he exposes are pretty important, in the context of the public interest. Certainly more important than who it was Al Gore went to Texas with to inspect disaster relief aid requirements. The American public has been played as a nation of rubes--suckers--patsies--by a bunch of slick right wing confidence men. The press knows this--yet says nothing. Obviously, the fix has been in for quite some time. By the time the American public wakes up to discover they've been cleaned out--the culprits will be long gone, either lying comfortably in their graves, or livin' high in the south of France. I wish Americans would get smart, grow wise, become skeptical, and question authority. IS the public interest the same as the economic and financial interests of the ruling class? This book does not answer that question, but at least it exposes some of the lies of their power mongering servants.	2003-09-07

For too long I've heard about the left-wing bias in the mass-media, and then all I see on TV is the right-wing side of a panel outshouting those on the left or center. While at times juvenile, Mr. Franken doesn't get anywhere near as nasty and vile as his contemporaries on the right, who I will not dignify with free advertising by mentioning them by name. Also, Mr. Franken doesn't come off as a rabid leftist, but more as someone who has become fed up with a slanted political discussion landscape, and he comes across as someone who actually cares about his readers because he doesn't insult their intelligence, unlike those of his right-wing contemporaries who simply &quot;scream&quot; the same statements over and over, without proof or conscience.	2003-09-07

Also, notice how he writes books that smear reputations.  Calling O'Reilly a liar is a case in point.  O'Reilly made a mistake saying Fox won a Peabody instead of a Polk award.

Is this the same Al Franken who use to make us keel over in laughter every Saturday night 20 years ago?  Maybe it is time for genuine Americans whose loyalty is to our country, and not to some ideology, to tell the O'Reillys, Hannitys, and yes, the Frankens, to knock it off.

And what makes this well-justified hatchet job so enjoyable is that he manages to be funny, and often, very funny, all while telling the truth.  <br />     Like Mr. Franken, I find the dishonesty and bullying by Fox pundits to be offensive and at times outright revolting.  But while many of us merely growl at the Fox misinformation service or turn the channel in disgust, this SNL-veteran has done the public a service by exposing some of the particular deceptions and lies of people like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity (although in the particular case of Mr. Hannity, the fault may lie with the fact that he is a rather dim bulb rather than any deliberate desire to deceive. It was Mr. Hannity after all, who offered up the most revealing quotation of the book: &quot;I don't have the time to refute every fact here&quot;). <br />     Mr. Franken's satirical take on the &quot;fair and balanced&quot; Fox News Channel effectively documents (for those who had not already picked up on this just by watching) that Bill O'Reilly is a self-righteous bully incapable of listening; that Sean Hannity is a pompous fool; and that Ann Coulter, well, there is something just not quite right about that woman. Possibly rabies. Just &quot;kidding on the square&quot; there; more likely she's just crazy.<br />     But it would be a mistake to see this book as anti-conservative; it is not. It is anti-dishonesty.  Not all conservatives are dishonest, but it is interesting that so many conservatives take an attack on dishonesty to be an attack on conservative ideas in general.  The book IS angry and it is from a liberal perspective; it doesn't pretend to beimpartial (making irrelevant the bitter comments of right-wing reviewers here that this book is bad because it is somehow &quot;one-sided&quot;).  Mostly this book is funny; in a certain sense, it is a &quot;joke&quot;, as some conservative reviewers have complained, although not in the sense that they intended.  But what it IS against is the kind of intellectual dishonesty and indifference to truth that has become so characteristic of so much of right-wing discourse, especially on television.  Are there liars on the left? No doubt, and shame on them for it (although you probably won't find many of them on talk radio in any case).  This is a book about people on the right, people who have a much higher television/radio/news profile than any comparable figures on the left that I can think of. And I think Mr. Franken is right in suggesting that some of the worst liars in public discourse today are situated on the right.<br />     I do think the book is uneven in places.  The &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot; section, while it underlines an important hypocrisy characteristic of many on the right, is nevertheless a bit cartoonish and over-the-top for my taste; I prefer Franken when he is merely skewering lies with facts.  Referring to Bill &quot;O'Lie-lly&quot; might be an understandable response to Bill O'Reilly's outrageous and bullying behavior at the book conference, but it is a kind of name-calling that isn't nearly as effective in making Franken's point as the mere documentation of O'Reilly's actual lies (such as his supposed political independence).<br />       For me, the strongest and most important chapter involved the conservative media treatment and distortion of the events at Paul Wellstone's memorial service (which then translated into a wider distortion in the wider media).  Franken's treatment is this issue is angry but controlled, and is in its own right a fine tribute to the memory of a man I respected as the finest Senator in the U.S. Senate in my lifetime, an honorable voice for the disenfranchised and politically marginalized.  The question is, when will those right-wing voices who made so much controversy on the basis of so little justification ever find it in themselves to apologize, to admit they did wrong?  It will, no doubt, be a cold day in hell before that happens, but as Mr. Franken documents, it is an apology to the country that these well-paid but badly informed(?) political spinmeisters on the right surely owe to the public.<br />     So buy the book.  It's not perfect, but it is very good.  It is funny and outrageous; and at times sad, even moving; it is loaded with facts and spiced with satire.  And as the reviewer from Midland, Texas, pointed out, we all owe Fox News a debt of gratitude for their absurd lawsuit against Mr. Franken, which helped propel this fine satire to the top of the best-seller lists.  As for those conservatives who fear and despise this book, all I can say is, read it and weep.	2003-09-07

Overall, I found it fairly well written and encouraging of healthy skepticism over cynicism.<br />The book is funny and from someone who reads mostly science and history books it felt like a very easy read, a relative page-turner for me. He jumps right in with very little introduction, which is greatly appreciated.<br />The satire and swearing is not overwhelming and was to me acceptable if not entirely appropriate or necessary. Mr. Franken is open about his own frailties and moments of uncertainty, which was also appreciated. He isn't afraid to admit that he was impressed by President Bush and found himself in support of the President or at least moved by him on several occassions. I think he articulates the attitudes and feelings of many liberals who have been trying to show their love for America and maintian their respect for the presidency, but have been perhaps a bit brainwashed that their opposition to current policies are unamerican and that maybe the tax cuts will help and deficits aren't that big a deal, etc... but feel in their gut that something isn't right. Mr. Franken's writing helped me feel more comfortable that my fears are justified, rational and normal and not coming from some radical left-wing genetic mutation that I've been suppressing.<br />The only parts I didn't care for was the Catherine Harris drama which I thought was a bit too much and the Bob Jones visit which was interesting but not very enlightening. I think most people would know what to expect from that type of place. He was a bit selective in not addressing Clinton's ethical and moral failings, including only his strengths while railing on the ethical weaknesses of various personalities, but that was his point.<br />His strength is in being up to the task of calling a jerk a jerk and explaining why.lective in not addressing Clinton's ethical and moral failings, including only his strengths while railing on the ethical weaknesses of various personalities, but that was his point.<br />His strength is in being up to the task of calling a jerk a jerk and explaining why.	2003-09-07

This is an important book - its virtues much outweigh its vices.  A word on both below.<br />If I hated Franken and wanted to go after him, I would have three examples from his book to use against him:<br />1.  I would imply hypocrisy on his pro-affirmative action stance articulated in his chapter on race, because the photo of &quot;Team Franken&quot; is as whitebread as it gets (page 368).  I can't believe he couldn't find an African-American or two at Harvard worthy of his team.  This is the kind of thing from which Fox Network could get much mileage.<br />2.  I would carefully read his endnotes and say some of his sources are easily suspect.  For example, I have often heard from several sources (including comic Dennis Miller) that Hillary Clinton did not attend one memorial service for the 9/11 victims.  This popular sound byte could use a sound Franken rebuttal.  Unfortunately, Al's source for saying Hillary attended eleven events reads, &quot;According to Senator Clinton's office, she's attended the following events...&quot;  Surely Franken could have come up with a less biased source to support Hillary Clinton than her own office.  Fodder for Fox.<br />3.  Uh, I guess there's only two.  Oh, but I did find a typo, and unfortunately, it is in David McLaughlin's beautiful eulogy.  On page 202, the second sentence in the paragraph which begins &quot;The funny thing is Will and Paul really did work well together.&quot;  You'll see it.  Somebody call Rick Willett before the paperback.  It's a shame to have this beautiful speech marred in any way.<br />On the positive side, Franken is brilliant at using neo-conservatives' words against them.  Critics of this book oftentimes do not give specific examples to refute Franken, but when Franken quotes Ann Coulter from her own book, and then reproduces the front page of the newspaper which shows her untruth, it is really hard to dispute.  This is Franken at his best.<br />Also, this book is laugh-out-loud funny at times.  Iread several passages aloud to my wife and a few co-workers.  Franken is not afraid to be self-effacing, and this book will give a good laugh to those who are not infuriated by his ideology.	2003-09-06

But if he is, then the people like Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reilly are clearly not accurate.  Still, that is a side issue - the book is entirely hysterical.  Honestly, I would read a funny book written by a funny republican; just so happens none exist - but when they are created, I will read their book too and laugh.  Until then, if you want to read a really funny book that is both interesting and immature (kind of like me), then I highly recommend it.	2003-09-06

Thank you Bill O'Reilly	Had Fox and Bill O'Reilly not sued Al Franken, I am almost certain I would not have purchased his book. I would have missed an enjoyable reading experience, but Franken did not tell me anything I did not already know. He did however add to my knowledge in an entertaining way and provides a  useful resource for future reference.<br />Probably most people who read Franken's book are already uneasy with the Bush Administration's policy.  But because of Fox and O?Reilly, there will be a large number of \\"undecideds\\" who will also read the book who would never have done so without their boast. For them, Franken's examination of the the right wing media may make a difference. Most regular viewers of Fox and O?Reilly will not be moved, but even among these readers, there may be a surprise or two or more. <br />Franken reflects an admittedly liberal, anti-Bush bias. But he is seldom over the top and few chapters (specifically. the one on Chickenhawks) I found to lack humor and even boring. Others, like the Chapter on Bob Jones, reflect his own excesses, something that Franken admits he is occasionally guilty of. Franken does a good job with his sources and notes by providing support for his comments without overwhelming the reader. All the quotes and sources I've checked have proven accurate. On the whole Franken's book is what it purports to be, a  satirical examination of the Bush administration and its media support team. Whether is it a also fair and balanced depends upon your social philosophy and political point of view.	2003-09-06

His scathing expose of both the current regime, and the media machine which has collectively decided to look the other way, is both brilliant and funny.  I was at one point, laughing until I cried at his volleys at Bill O'Reilly.  Although &quot;thinking&quot; is something that conservatives have had a difficult time with over the past few years, this book (even if one disagrees with his politics) forces the reader to THINK.  &quot;Lying Liars...&quot; is the perfect counterpoint to the pablum generated by the likes of Coulter, Hannity, et al.<br />I do find it interesting that the reviews which uniformly give this book &quot;one star&quot;, do not actually review the book.

At the LA Book Expo, televised on C-Span, I saw Al's big argument with Bill O'Reilly, when Bill petulantly refused to read Mr. Franken's book.  Now I see why he'd be hesitant --(or afraid?).  Al has actual documents--documents!!!-- that show Bill O'Reilly is a liar -- documents on one lie anyway.  No documents for the other lies, but lots of fun facts!  Al is also fair (fair and balanced? -- let's sue him!) when he says that Bill is not, and I'm paraphrasing, 'not as bad as some others out there'.  And that 'at times I agree with him.'  Bill calls himself a journalist.  If he is, he should get past the hate he feels for this intellectually superior man -- (and more importantly, a man of greater integrity -- read it, you decide!), and read this well backed up book, and see the 'great' in it.  Maybe even-- yipes!--  discuss it on his show, or God forbid, LEARN SOMETHING FROM IT!  It's not all about Bill at all.  He can skip the stuff about himself, in fact.  Did you know Al Gore never said he invented the internet?  I did.  So did many others who pay attention.  But my goodness, it's nice to have Al Franken break it down in black and white for the closed minded liars who love believing anything untrue about someone they hate.  There is so much here that is right on.  I am a moderate, by the way.  I have voted Republican in local elections.  If you're open minded, you'll love this book, be saddened by it, angered by it, all of those things.  The Clinton terrorist stuff is amazing.  People who blame Clinton should READ it, and then research it as I did after reading it.  Al's dead on.  Now, I'm mostly pointing out the O'Reilly stuff, which is unfortunate because the stuff on Hannity is priceless.  What a jerk.  This is someone who can 'fudge' -- to say the least.  A true liar and bully -- gotta read it.  It's there, and it's PUBLIC RECORD.)  But when Bill spoke at the LA Expo about raising the discourse in America, and then called Frankena 'propagandist'-- well, I think, no matter how much one likes O'Reilly (I watch him nearly every night.  I agree with him sometimes too), one must say that he's hypocrital if he says let's elevate the discourse, and then calls someone a propagandist without reading his book.  Read his book.  You'll see.  You'll see a lot if you keep your heart and mind open.	2003-09-06

The first type of person is the liberal.  For too long liberals have been hiding, for fear that others would find out their dirty little secret.  It's time to come out of the closet.  Al Franken has made it so.<br />The second type of person who should read this book is the intellectually curious.  I am astounded by the number of inaccuracies that Al Franken has pointed out.  It is amazingly detailed in its research.  The conservative media are often lazy in its fact checking.  Sometimes they flat out lie!<br />Caution!  Do not read this if you are conservative.

This book is a satire.  It is supposed to be funny, and it is.  Franken is a comedian, a very successful one too.  The point is that he takes facts - yes, facts - and presents them in a way that is funny.  Since he's dealing with the hard core right (Coulter, Bush, Rush, et al.), that means all he has to do is repeat (as in quote) what these people have already said.  Neat trick:  repeat what Ann Coulter said; get a laugh.  Michael Moore did the same thing in \\"Bowling for Columbine\\".  Remember the Charlton Heston interview?  Remember the militia dude who said that to be unarmed is to be irresponsible?  The only fault that I can find is that satirizing the hard core right is shockingly easy to do, and therefore, no great achievement. Then again, the book is a satire.  It doesn't present itself as a reasoned, intellectual response to the hard core right.  For that, see Joe Conason's new book.  By writing that book, Conason has basically put himself in the position of being the muscle bound bully kicking sand in the face of the 98 pound weakling.  I take that back.  Actually, he's more like the 98 pound weakling who went to the gym, got some muscles and then beat up the bully.<br />One more comment for the 1-star reviewers.  The book does not present hard core leftist views.  If it does, then this must be a hard core leftist country since this book is #1 on Amazon's list and because more than half of the country voted for Gore, a hard core leftist according to Coulter, Rush, et al.	2003-09-06

It's funnier than I expected it would be, and also more substantial - well researched, and (as one reviewer noted) even a little dry in places, as befits a book that actually makes forays into serious fact-checking and truth-telling on virtually every page.  The jokes are the gravy, but there's a pretty serious biscuit underneath.  In its way, it's an even more effective critique of rightwing b.s. than Joe Conason's estimable Big Lies, if only because Conason goes out of his way to be fair to the likes of Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, and the rest of the factually challenged class, while Franken just hammers 'em.

Then crawl over Franken's book with a microscope and find a single inaccurary if you can. No one has yet.<br />It would be nice if people would base their assessment of a book on whether it is based on facts and fairness rather than whether it supports their ideology.<br />But I'm afraid it won't happen. The few negative reviews of this book come from people who may or may not have read it, but are rejecting Franken's politics rather than the accuracy of his examples. (And for good reason ... they're accurate.)<br />I have nothing but praise for his accurate research and his analysis of the right-wing propaganda machine and the dangers it poses to honest intellectual discourse. And I think if you're basing your assessment of it on your political persuasion, you would be well advised to consider whether a political persuasion that depends on misleading people for support is worth maintaining.<br />Also recommended: &quot;Big Lies&quot; by Joe Conason and &quot;What Liberal Media?&quot; by Eric Alterman.	2003-09-06

(That they've failed in this can be seen by the Four Star average the book maintains.)<br />I was raised in a Republican family and registered Republican when I turned 18. As I grew older and saw more of the world, I couldn't help but realize that many so-called truisms I had been raised with were, in fact...not true. The world is a much more complex place than those of a fanatical bent (of either right or left) would like, and I now stand as the only Democrat in quite an extended family of rock-ribbed Republicans. That most of these people are intelligent, yet hold such unintelligent and simplistic views fascinates and baffles me. It's not that a good argument can't be made for some conservative ideas; it's that I don't hear any, mostly, from my family. I get canned bromides which are recited as dogma and believed without having been really thought through.  (&quot;A rising tide raises all boats.&quot; Well, what if you don't own a boat? The rising tide may drown you. Reminds me of Father Bush's mythical &quot;average American who has $100,000.00 to invest,&quot; (sic). Besides, since when has it been shown that Reagan's--and now Bush's--policies result in a &quot;rising tide&quot; to begin with? For those who are hooked in to the pipeline, there's hot-and-cold running oil--er, water; for most of us, there's a drought.) The success of the arch-Right's &quot;big lie&quot; technique can be seen in the oft-promulgated (and believed!) right-wing fantasy that Republicans are the Party of the &quot;people,&quot; of down-to-earth folk like you 'n me, while the Democrats are the party of the elite, the effete, and the special interests, so-called. Historically, this is exactly the opposite of the truth! Perhaps it's just indicative of the power of wishful thinking: so many who labor at jobs-of-work are so envious of those above them on the economic ladder that they identify with them and have convinced themselves they are merely a few years work away from ascending into the wealthy elect. Formerly, those who were laborers--and whether it's ditch-digging or office-drudgery, if you're not the owner of capital, you're labor--were clear-sighted in their recognition of where and with whom they stood. 50 years of television have turned us into childish star-gazers, seeing ourselves as almost part of a club from which we are actually being forcibly barred.<br />Franken eviscerates the tissue of propaganda and lies which so many like those in my family believe as almost religious faith...because they WANT to believe.  He's funny, he's smart, he's done his research, and his book delivers the goods. If you're funny and smart, you'll enjoy this book. If you're not, you won't.	2003-09-06

The funniest part of the battle is not the slings and arrows between &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;conservatives&quot;, but the fact that the Limbaughs, O'Reillys and Frankens of the world actually think that they're important to the political process, that their rants have any meaning. Consider that the highest rated TV blowhard, Mr. O'Reilly, gets but a smidge more than 1% of the 107 million American TV households to turn into him indicates that this ideological battle royale is a rather intimate event.<BR> <BR>So, the release of yet another political blowhard's book comes along, and because he has the gall to crib the Fox &quot;news&quot; channel's slogan, he's front page news. <br />But is the book actually any good? Compared to his conservative colleagues, no more so or less so. Like Ann Coulter, he's not above callous and childish name calling. Like Bill O'Reilly, he's every bit as pompous in faux-academia. Like Limbaugh (and, frankly ALL celebrity political &quot;commentators&quot;), he's like a kid in the back row of a classroom, shooting spit-balls.<BR> <BR>But unlike the conservative tome-loaders, at least he makes no bones about the fact that (a) he's a punk, and (b) he's screwing around as much as he's pontificating. And, with that, it's actually pretty funny.<BR> <BR>Of course, if the liberal vs. conservative cage match is serious to you, then regardless of your leanings, this book will anger you. If you're like me, though, and think the nightly blatherings from these so-called pundits are really pretty funny on their own, then this book will be a real entertaining read.	2003-09-06

I have read over many of the reviews, both the glowing 5 star and the more realistic one star. I think the real truth probably lies somewhere in between (pardon the pun) Al Franken is nothing but an unattractive failed comedian (Did you see \\"Stuart Saves His Family? Neither Did I!) who represents the views of the Hollywood liberal elite. The utter stupidity of this book is evident in its oh-so-funny title. Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them...how clever! The glowing reviews were undoubtedly written by the brainwashed Harvardites whom he paid to write the book for him...<br />I am a person who believes in questioning the media, so unlike some poor saps I don't swallow every story hook, line, and sinker. There are lies being spread. However, Franken reserves his hatred for liars only for conversative liars. Speaking of LIARS, does this sound familiar: \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman....\\"? Need I mention that your darling Clinton will go down in history as being IMPEACHED?<br />This book is nothing but a piece of garbage. Liberals are hell bent on destroying this country. They vilify those who made this country great, namely white males with Judeo-Christian values. They seek a country that has been turned on its head, with political correctness taking the place of any form of fairness or justice. The media, BESIDES the one lone voice in the wilderness, Fox News, overwhelmingly slams conservatives and glosses over the foibles of their pets, the liberal left.<br />Ann Coulter is a brilliant woman and her work is clearly above the head of simpletons such as Franken.	2003-09-06

Regardless of your party affiliation, this book will make you walk away thinking about the environment, milatary,the media, economics, and other issues of national interest. <br />Even if you don't agree with Al's liberal political philosophy I think you should defend your viewpoints with researched facts to defend your opinions. This book demonstrates how various people affiliated with the Republican and Democratic party carry their political agendas and Al does this by using humor as his vehicle. And the book was FUNNY (Even Convservatives have to laugh about Al's ridiculous attempt to stop &quot;Sissifying&quot; politics by challenging a journalist to a fight in his parking garage).<br />The book was also informative and hopefully will help lead to political discussions that include everyone in meaningful way.

Coulter is a disgrace to not just the right but America and all it stands for.  Hannity and Colmes should be re-named to the Sean Hannity Show because Alan Colmes simply is not as vociferous as his counterpart and it hurts the left.  I'm Republican but more importantly I'm a proud American.  I would prefer to hear fair and balanced because it is good for public discourse but it simply is not happening and never will. He who yells loudest is usually the one heard.  I was really disheartened to learn the truths about Al Gore and Love Canal, the Internet and Love Story.  Franken illustrates the truth about the lies that were told by the media that negatively affected Gore's run for the presidency.  It is worth buying this book just to read about this alone.  Some that read this review may question my loyalty to the GOP.  At times I do myself.  I simply wish that everyone would put the country first rather than their agenda.  After completing the book I'm a little more than disillusioned with the lies in the media.  We should stand for it no longer.  This is an excellent book for everyone!	2003-09-06

Honest, informed debate is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy. \\"Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them\\" opens the window to allow the fresh air of truth into public discussion.  The book is not about conservative versus liberal.  It is primarily about absolutes: lies and truths.  A conservative like John McCain would find Franken's book to be a welcome bit of honesty given the current media climate.  Many Americans have been misled to think that broadcast journalism is some hodgepodge of entertainment, opinions, selective man-on-the-street interviews, and slivers of facts delivered by videogenic models with the personalities of malicious frat boys.  Mr. Franken's book dissects the \\"lie machine\\" and it is about time.  Fortunately, the sales indicate it's not too late for truth reclamation. I do regret that Mr. Franken did not include the chapter he was working on about how chummy the Bushes are with the bin Ladens. One more thing - it's very, very funny.  I am quite grateful that Mr. Franken did not follow in the footsteps of his fellow Lampoon alums, content to change nothing in the world, collecting checks to write unproduced scripts.	2003-09-05

Of course, any conservative who picks up the book will be agast at the content. This book is not genious because it bashes the right or proves that conservatives including the president have lied moderately, this book is genious because it proves that not only are republicans lying chronically but also sometimes intentionally and their lies are working. Franken does something that the right finds hard to do, and that is rationally refute in an arguemnt using facts and statistics and he does so with comic genious and that is why this book is a five.	2003-09-05

The truth is always more fun anyway.  Try getting a laugh out of Hannity's book.<br />It's doubtful that any of these conservatives (the ones who rated this book a 1 star) have given this book anything but a cursory read, or flipped through it at all.  But for those who have, I would challenge them to point out just a couple of the facts that Franken and his researchers got wrong.

However, a man who finds the New York Times to be 100% objective and finds Fox News to be so right-wing that it's fascist has some serious issues. His writing is on the level of Michael Moore's (that is to say, horrible and full of lies and slander).<br />You would think a book that pruportes to be a \\"Fair and balanced look at the right\\" would do more than just insult everyone with whom he does not agree.<br />If you wish to read a liberal who knows how to write and actually is funny, check out Bill Maher.

He exposes their lies using a wry wit that I really enjoyed. By far this is the best part of the book. I was very disapointed at his defense of Bill Clinton, Franken tells half-truths or distorts the truth to defend Clinton, He lambasts Sean Hannity for doing the same thing defending Bush. He uses as an example that Clinton couldnt have left our military in too bad of shape because we did so well in afghanistan where the Soviets failed. He fails to mention that the soviets were fighting the US backed mujahideen, we were fighting the Taliban, huge difference. He also failed to mention that one reason for the delay in going into Afghanistan was that we had factories running literally 24/7 making missles to replace our depleted stockpile. He also uses as an example a story about soldier in afhanistan using a laptop to communicate with a Predator UAV drone. Franken is trying to imply that Clinton really concentrated on providing the military with high tech equipment, in fact the drone was borrowed from the CIA which obviously will have various spy planes and is separate from the military budget. He also defends Bill Clintons failure to negotiate Bin Ladin from Sudan. His argument here is so one sided and leaves out so many important details that it would leave the reader with the impression that Clintons hands were tied and could do nothing, that is simply not the case.  I would suggest the reader do some thorough research on Mansoor Ijaz and you will find that Franken is telling only half the story. There are too many of these examples to mention them all. Almost every instance of his defense of Clinton falls short.  Franken should stick to poking fun at Fox, Hannity, Bush and their cronies, thats where he shines. Also although some reviewers stated that they found his tone angry, I didn't. I thought that was refreshing after being overwhelmed by books by Limbaugh and Michael Moore. I would suggest the reader research facts in this book that seem suspicous.est the reader research facts in this book that seem suspicous.	2003-09-05

One of the huge number of ironies behind the Fox lawsuit over the use of \\"Fair and Balanced\\" is that, in fact, like Michael Moore, Al Franken loves to hide behind the \\"entertainer\\" label to promote a front-loaded agenda -- but conservative pundits (and very many followers) have a core failing that disallows them from holding two thoughts in their heads at the same time (e.g. support the troops vs. against the war, love my country vs. criticize the government) and therefore a satarist that also has an agenda fries their mind.<br />Meanwhile the biggest differences between Franken and Moore is that:<BR>1) Franken is funny (really funny)<BR>2) Franken checks the heck out of his facts (or actually has a heck of lot of minions to do that)<BR>3) Franken does not fudge around with dates, times, places, video imagery, questionable cuts and juxtopositions to make a point -- he just looks up the facts, calls the participants and quotes the sources.<br />This is timely and welcome book -- a fantastic trip down redemption road.	2003-09-05

Of course, he hasn't been taking it for sometime now. In \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them...\\" he skewers, yet again,  some of the conservative right's brightest, yet dullest stars i.e., Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Paul Wolfowitz, Karl Rove, Dick Cheney, and, of course, George W. Bush. In addition, he briskly tweaks the nose of Alan Colmes, Hannity's ineffectual token liberal.<br />  Nowhere is the truth of Franken's effort more effectively shown than by the \\"reviewers\\" on this site who gave him one star. To a person, their \\"criticism\\" is expressed in ad hominum attacks; none counter with any arguments of substance.<br />  That Franken is angry is obvious, but, for the most part, he tempers it with humor. An exception is his piece on how the right deliberately misrepresented the memorial service for Senator Paul Wellstone, accusing Democrats of using the occasion to make political hay while, in the doing, did  exactly that themselves. Franken doesn't just offer a biased take on what happened that day in Minnesota, but quotes the conservative opportunists, complete with locations and dates.<br />  Midway through the book  Al offers up a brief diversion with a prequel to  \\"Operation Chicken Hawk\\" which appeared in \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot...\\" Operation Chicken Hawk: Episode One,  was almost worth the price of the book.<br />  TeamFranken, as Al refers to the fourteen Harvard students, who did most of his research, were right on the money in their quest for the facts. I say this because, even though I'm a stunch liberal, I didn't accept their stuff out of hand. I made at least twenty random checks for myself, including the GAO report of its investigation into charges  that Clinton staffers \\"trashed\\" the White House during the 2000 presidential transition. I was able to verify every one.<br />  Franken isn't writing fiction, as some here have charged. What he's done is called the \\"Liars\\" out and exposed them. I watched, for instance, his bout with Bill O'Reilly,  and read for myself O'Reilly's handling of the son of one of the men who died at the World Trade Center, who made the mistake of going on his show. Bill didn't like what he was saying so cut him off, in mid sentence, then, when they went off the air, threatened to beat him up. The account I read was written by the man involved.<br />  \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them...\\" can be read with  confidence in its accuracy.

Where else can you hear a fair and balanced approach like this recent exchange:  Hannity was interviewing a young man who had been arrested for his activities as a human shield in Iraq.  Hannity lambasted the man, saying that we live in a society where people must obey the law and if they don't, they will and should be punished.  A few minutes later, while interviewing the judge who defied the Supreme Court's ruling to remove the ten commandments from his Court house, the same Hannity congratulated the judge for disobeying the law and standing up for what he thought was right.

However, my only request is that you wait til the book slips down a few notches on the best seller list.<BR>This book is hilarious and factual; the only thing that would make it more funny is if it weren't true.	2003-09-05

Just the titles alone of Franken's book indicate how ready he is to make cheap shots (\\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot,\\" and this one.) I found the book surprisingly not funny.

If you liked his book that took on Big Fat Idiot Rush, you'll absolutely love Franken blasting Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and their ilk, not to mention Resident Bush, for the lies that they knowingly spout to an unquestioning public on a daily basis through our largely right-wing controlled media.  Though there is some degree of overlap, I would also recommend the book \\"Lies\\" by Joe Conason.	2003-09-05

I loved the book then.  In the years since, I have received my Bachelor's degree, started my career, and continued growing in maturity and intellect.  This new Franken book, I unconsciously assumed, would fail to appeal to the older me.  My assumptions were buttressed when the mainstream media portrayed this as an ribald, \\"angry\\" book, or, worse, a left-wing version of anti-intellectual polemists of Coulter, Savage, & Hannity.  But I picked up the book for old time's sake.  I read a random essay, then another random essay.  I was hooked.  I read chapter 1, and read all they way to the end.<br />This book was simply delightful to read.  My assumptions were dead wrong.  I am angry at myself for falling victim to the right-wing echo chamber.  I thought I was smarter than to be bamboozled, but it's hard not ignore countless messages in the media.<br />Franken's essays concerning Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly, and Goldberg are priceless.  He debunks Coulter's \\"research\\" \\"methods\\" in his Coulter essay.  For instance, Coulter cites an NYT passage that appears to blame Christians for the Holocaust.  (Oh, those Christian-hating liberals!)  TeamFranken checked it out.  They discovered the passage originally appeared in a review of a play that posed the question to its audience.  The chapter on O'Reilly lies was even stronger and damning.  His lies are relatively benign when taken individually:  claiming he grew up in a \\"working class\\" Irish neighborhood when he's in fact grew up in an affluent suburb, claiming to be registered independent when in fact he registered Republican, and his infamous claiming of a pair of Peabody awards (a story, by the way, that O'Reilly is constantly changing).  In one part of the essay, Franken excerpts a passage from O'Reilly's novel about a former television reporter who, in revenge, murders his former co-workers (you read that right).  O'Reilly's writing is so pedestrian, sobizarre, that one can't help but laugh in befuddlement.  Taking together the lies, the bizarre book, and stories of O'Reilly's yelling at people and threatening bodily harm, the reader is left with a damning mosaic of a man so arrogant, so self-serving, and so full of himself, that he lacks the internal mechanism most of us possess that keeps us telling lies to prop ourselves up.<br />There are many more wonderful essays in the book.  There's also some that don't work.  His chastising of Alan Colmes was a bit overboard, for one.  No author's work is perfect.  But these are minor points.  The book is wonderful.  Franken's wit reminds me of Woody Allen or James Thurber; his method reminds me a little bit of Kurt Vonnegut.  The simple prose of Vonnegut and Franken produce chuckles and smiles while one reads'but minutes after one finishes the work, one becomes disturbed and angry.<br />Most of Franken's readers will find this book fun, smart, and intelligently angry & a nice and welcome break from more demanding books of, literature like, say, Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, or serious publications, perhaps the New Republic, the Weekly Standard.  Readers of Coulter, Hannity, Limbaugh, on the other hand, take their large-type, double-spaced books remarkably seriously.  They creat \\"personality cults\\" (\\"Dittoheads\\").  The is so, I'm sure, because most are unsophisticated and uneducated. I would be shocked to know if many of their readers are aware of liberals like John Stuart Mill or political thinkers like Rousseau. <br />One final compliment.  The book thoroughly entertained me and made me smile.  But unlike ephemeral entertainment, this one will stay with me.  I am often too lenient with these O'Reillys or Coulters of ourworld.  They are harmless trash, I think, much like Christina Aguilara, and not worth my attention.  But books like Franken's remind me that even the trashiest of the trashy books matter & they influence our politics.  Liberals, progressives, and Democrats mustfight back--whether it be with sharp humor, with intelligent anger, or with our voice--no matter how inane these people are.  These things matter.  To use a cliche, I genuinely got something out of this book.<br />Mr. Franken, I would bet $50 you are skimming these reviews.  I apologize for unconsciously believing the right-wing spin and the ensuing echoes in the mainstream press.  I loved the book.  I hope we won't have to wait another seven years before the next essay collection.  Wonderful job to you and to TeamFranken.	2003-09-05

The scientific method has been a part of western civilization since the renaissance.  In a nutshell, you propose a hypothesis, then use a logical process to test the hypothesis.  True believers of various persuasions often oppose this process, much as the Office of the Holy Inquisition opposed it, because there is the possibility that certain faith based statements of &quot;fact&quot; may be refuted by &quot;evidence.&quot;<br />Here, various misleading statements, illogical conclusions, and outright lies are put to the test by gathering evidence to prove them true or false.  Yes, the results are transmitted to us in a humorous way, but that in no way detracts from the factual basis of the book.<br />The facts are the facts and are subject to verification.<br />Certain people aligned politically with the liars Franken takes on accuse him of being mean spirited, and even of lying himself.  The latter is a grave accusation.  Fortunately, that is not simply an opinion, it is also subject to verification.  If they are correct in saying Franken is not telling us the truth in this book, they should be able to back that statement up with verifiable evidence.  No such evidence has been produced so far.<br />In other words, if your calling someone a liar, you had better put up or shut up.  Here, Franken has put up.  His detractors have not.	2003-09-05

I think all of you right-wingers or neo-cons, whichever you prefer, share a brain. I've seen a ton of reviews for this book that contain the same lines, rants, or other misinformation. What's up with that? I've also noticed that most who write these simple, unintelligible rantings don't leave a name. So I have to assume you're all sharing \\"A Reader's\\" brain. I'd like to know where he/she is today and why he/she shares his brain so freely.<br />I also find it funny that so many people write of Franken's hatred of the right, have any of you read books by Hannity, Coulter, or Limbaugh? All of their books are are hate-spewing rants demonizing the left. Franken picks and chooses his targets, he doesn't lump together (Coulter saying anyone left-leaning are traitors, Hannity saying anyone left-leaning doesn't care about the safety of this country, and Limbaugh well is Limbaugh).<br />I watched the Bill O'Rielly and Franken go at it at the book expo. O'Rielly had just finished saying he didn't call people names like Franken when he called Franken an idiot, and anyone familiar with his show knows he slings insulting names nightly. On his show O'Rielly said he wanted to \\"shoot him between the head\\". Aside from being an idiotic statement, it shows his mental level saying he wants to kill someone because of a politcal disagreement. Although O'Reilly didn't shoot Franken he was the driving force behind the lawsuit which I liken to those brought against fast-food. Which also shows O'Reilly's hypocrisy. Independent my foot.<br />I beg you right-wingers look up the word satire. Franken is a master and has his facts straight, unlike Coulter. Those of you complaining that this book isn't \\"fair and balanced\\" just don't get it and never will (it's as \\"fair and balanced\\" as the news channel that uses that slogan, just to the other side; which is the point). Buy this book even if you don't agree with his politics you will laugh and have better understanding the political climate that exists in America today.	2003-09-05

If Fox wants to get a valid reputation, they should replace Colmes with Franken. Hannity and Franken.  Not only would they get real debate, but the show would be much funnier!<br />This book simply reveals lies and liars in a funny way.  To all conservatives:  Franken is not talking about you. He is talking about media liars that are telling you what you want to hear.  I understand how a conservative might believe in tax cuts, less government, less regulation - but how can you defend your beliefs without the facts?  More importantly, how can you - as a person blessed with critical thinking - believe what you believe?

This his humor can occasionally be off the mark (Cheerleaders in chadors?  What the hell was he thinking?!?!), more often tan not it is as on-target as a laser-guided missile, and I found myself laughing out loud at something in almost every chapter.  As good as the book is, though, I did have some reservations: 1) the Operation Chickenhawk chapter was way too obvious and heavy-handed, 2) unless you're really up on your current events, it may be hard at times to tell when he is joking and when he is relating a true incident, 3) there is no index, making it difficult to locate specific points in the book.  However, the chapter on the memorial to Paul Wellstone is deeply moving and more than makes up for it.  Very highly recommended.	2003-09-04

During my campaign to become the Governor of California, I have met many liars. Before I started, I had no friends. Now everyone wants to be my friend, even my enemies. Clint Eastwood wants to be my friend and so does Sylvester Stallone. And Jerry Springer. He keeps calling me at 2 in the morning asking if I want to go get a drink and a couple of broads. I always say no and give him Bill Clinton's number. I admire Bill Clinton. He lied but then he confessed. That took guts. Then he confessed that his confession was a lie. That took guts too. I give my constituents in California this solemn promise; I will never lie. And when I do, I will confess. Teddy Kennedy once told me that the truth will set you free. Tell that to Nelson Mandela.	2003-09-04

This book is really funny (Franken's dark wit is great--I've always liked it) but, more astonishingly, very well researched.  It's not just a screed--this book gun's are loaded.<br />I read a transcript of O'Reilly interviewing Ann Coulter about &quot;Treason&quot;.  In it, he says that Franken is just a vile person, and agrees with Coulter that she is far funnier.  WhaWhaWhat!<br />This book isn't a mean spirited attack--it is a reaction to these truely nasty books like Treason and Let Freedom Ring.  It was nice to see someone say &quot;hold on, wait a minute.&quot;<br />The only bad thing about this book is that Franken really is a party-line Democrat.  I don't think party-liners are really liberal.  He defends Clinton and the rest so vehemently, you would think that they don't do anything bad either.  It's a little too black and white for me.  However, that only comes once in a while. Overall, a great, funny read.	2003-09-04

I bought this book initially because I am sick of seeing labels such as 'Treason' demonizing a views held by half the population of this country. With this book, Al is not demonizing the conservative viewpoint, but attacks a few specific media people who are either 'true believers' who care nothing for fact-checking or pure machiavellian liars who will say anything to give power to the right. The title of the book caters to the angry leftists, but the content of the book is suitable for anyone who wants to hear the liberals defend themselves without the demonizing the average joe conservative.<br />The book is funny, but not exceptionally hilarious or anything like that. I could have done without the 'Operation ChickenHawk' chapter. Hey Al, if Ollie North likes it I wouldn't take it as a good sign. But overall the humor makes this book very easy to read.<br />The book is very informative, loaded with hard refutations of 'facts'laid out by Fox newsers. An example is O'Reilly's &quot;Im a registered independent&quot; line is debunked with a scan of his voter registration card with Republican checked.<br />Another thing he brings up: I always thought of Alan Colmes as a lightweight too! He needs to be replaced...Where is Micheal Kinsley?<br />Anyways, overall a good and funny book	2003-09-04

It would make you angry if it weren't so funny.  But after the laughs subside I found myself asking a lot of questions - which is what I think Frankel's aim really is.

I got Al's book as a birthday gift, and I'm glad that I did, since I probably would not have gotten it for myself. I figured that as a staunch liberal I wouldn't learn anything, and that so much of the book would be just a bunch of personal attacks that it would be off-putting. While there are a lot of personal attacks (about lies more than splotchy faces, but there are both sorts) the general subject of the book is the ways in which the right-wing has \\"spun\\" (read \\"lied\\") about everything from G.W.'s past to the cover-up of the real facts behind Sept. 11th and the administrations failure to react to the information they had. There are lots of lies pointed out, but there are also lots of facts that counter those lies. There are plenty of crude jokes too, which is perhaps Franken's weakest point -- his strength is now political writing and not comedy. But overall Franken succeeds in countering some of the lies of the right. Not only will free-thinkers find it entertaining and enlightening, but for many who wouldn't ever pick up anything written by Anne Coulter or listen to Rush Limbaugh, the book provides a record of what's being said about liberals and counter-arguments to them. It's a must-read for everyone with a sense that something is going wrong, but who isn't sure exactly what, who, and why.	2003-09-04

Sean!<br />Say it enough and that darn liberal media will actually have you believing they actually exist.  But as Al and Team Franken point out... they can't possibly exist.  At least not in a world that is dominated by that same liberal media - what with all their scrupulous fact checking and all.  <br />Come to think of it - how do Rush (the large one) and Sean (the smart one) make it onto the airwaves in a liberally-biased media?  Maybe they do exist... but they're actually liberals!  Oh my!  <br />Of course, it's easy to get caught up in the circular &quot;reasoning&quot; of the right.  But don't be confused - just read Lies and it will all make sense.  And if it doesn't make sense after you read Lies, what's it matter?  Al was only in it for the money any way - and you'll already have bought the book.  See... those sneaky liberal are always up to something.  <br />Look - if you believe that near record unemployment (at least in recent American history) is okay and that record deficits are not that bad, or that it's good that we went after Saddam, because what's a few American lives when it comes to killing a whole bunch of Arabs? then you probably won't like Lies.  But, on the other hand, should you find an ounce of sympathy in your heart for other human beings and wonder why the world is like it is - read it.  You'll laugh.  You may cry.  You'll learn.  And hopefully you'll be moved to do something that's just crazy (like vote... for a different President).<br />It's a great book and a quick read (you don't have to be overly complex to understand how these people lie - but you may need to be awake)!	2003-09-03

Funnier, and with better fact-checking than Michael Moore (with the help of TeamFranken) this book details the many lies propogated by the radical right, and all-too-blithely disseminated by our lazy, ineffectual media.  Franken alternates between humorous tidbits, biting satire and devastating research that picks apart the lies told by the likes of Ann (Thrax) Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and everyone's favorite right-wing blowhard, Rush Limbaugh.  I recommend this book to everyone who needs a break from the all-too-serious political season that is upon us, and who nonetheless wants to get it all straight, sift through the hype, and see what's going on in our society.	2003-09-03

I look forward to seeing him here in St. Louis again when he will present a lecture and book signing later this month. As evidenced by his top selling status here on amazon.com, and other such lists, there are a lot of people in this nation who are tired of the status quo and tired of simply throwing our hands up in despair. There is something we can do to make change.  We can start by speaking up and out.  Franken speaks out for the voiceless among us who have been shut out of the corporate-media-military-industrial complex.

This book is an essential--full of useful information uncovering the lies that the Right spews out unceasingly.  <br />But it's not just a dry read, full of boring charts and information, though there's plenty of that for the information purist.  Al interjects his commentary with hilarious anecdotes and jokes as well.  I mean, how seriously can you take someone like Ann Coulter, who would like to see all liberals drawn and quartered?  The viewpoint of the Right's most aggressive proponents is hilariously skewered by truth after truth, all in a sort of a can-this-really-be-happening-to-our-country? type of comedy.<br />The lies are amazing, and so abundant as to elicit disbelief.  Was Ann Coulter born in 1960, or 1963?  She says 1963 now--if so, then she voted when she was 16. That's illegal.  Sean Hannity tells his viewers that poor people had the lowest taxes during Reagan.  Al actually shows that no, they had huge taxes during the Reagan years.  Bill O'Reilly claims to have been an independent, but no, he was actually a registered Republican. These are but a very few of the lies uncovered by Franken.  <br />Al Franken gives me hope.  Hope that the lies told by the Right will be uncovered, and this corporate-bought bureaucracy that is now the American government can someday go back to being an actual democracy.

Insightful political commentary with just the right touch of Frankenesque sarcasm.  This book should be read by every decent American that is bombarded  day after day with the lies of the \\"Right\\". His chapter on Bush and his \\"sissyhawk\\" friends titled \\"Operation Chickenhawk: episode one\\", is by far the most hilarious slam I've read regarding the \\"patriotism\\" of the likes of Rush Limbaugh, George Will, Gingrich and others who paint themselves as being on the \\"right\\" side of the flag.  Franken has scored a direct hit on so many of the \\"right\\" (the lying liars). He makes no bones about his dislike for the transgenered (my words not Franken's) Ann Coulter (have you ever seen an Adam's apple like Coulter's on another woman?) and Sean (I'm an idiot) Hannity.  Bravo Al for some of the best laughs I've had in some time.  You must be one heck of a great drinking buddy.

There's the evisceration of a misleading table and replament with a more honest table - about the true beneficiaries of the Reagan tax cuts in the first book, and about the true culprit behind Reagan's deficits in this one. There's a return to the White House Correspondents' Dinner - Franken was a performer in the first book during the Clinton years, a guest here during these Bush years. And there's a reprise of 'Operation Chickenhawk', in which Franken imagines what might have happened if famous hawkish conservatives had actually had to go to Vietnam.<br />For me, however, the best part of the book was almost smack dab in the center. Unlike the conservative commentators who railed against it, Franken was actually present for the now-infamous Wellstone Memorial, and in what is possibly the most moving chapter in the book, Franken first describes the memorial and his experience of it, then explains how the Republican party, assisted by the right-wing media apparatus that supports them, manipulated the substance and twisted the meaning of that memorial for their own political gain.<br />Though some of the motifs may be familiar, the factual material is new and copiously researched thanks to what Franken refers to as TeamFranken, his crew of Harvard-educated research assistants. The humor, of course, is all Franken. If you enjoyed \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\", you will not for a moment regret picking this one up.	2003-09-03

More seriously, and in all fairness, it must be said that this book is somewhat uneven. About as uneven as the state of Texas might be after a hundred-mile-wide asteroid plunged into the heart of Houston. And that is exactly where this book is aimed: straight at George W. Bush and his team of enormously wealthy corporate sponsors.<br />Having gotten your attention, in the fashion of a naked, screaming maniac running with scissors down your street at high noon, Franken's book proceeds to document a laundry list of lies, distortions, and bullying by the likes of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and George W. Bush. More importantly, \\"Lies\\" attempts to puncture the respectful silence and the aura of intimidation surrounding the Right's current domination of all three branches of government and most of the electronic media.<br />Did it take a screaming maniac to make that point?

I couldn't wait to get my hands on Al Franken's new book and, having read it, feel fully vindicated.

He takes on several of the right wing's leading lights (Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Bush Jr., Richard M. Scaife, Paul Gigot, etc.) and sweet reading it makes. Yet at the same time I was saddened and disgusted at how contemptible these people, who wield so much power, are.<br />There are some laugh-out-loud moments, but the tone is more entertaining than funny. An entertaining look at material that otherwise would be unbearable to read. One of the values of humor is that it allows us to process things that can be quite disturbing - process them rather than run away altogether.

Spew the same lies long enough and they become part of the national discourse.

The fact that Franken's book has been selling so well should be proof that many people are getting tired of the lies.

Now, what do we have representing the Conservative Right? A bunch of fearbased whores preaching scare tactics and blaming Clinton for everything. Not one ounce of intellect or prose has been presented to us(well, I like William F. Buckley so he is excused) by these nutbags like Savage, Coulter, Hannity and the rest of the slack jawed troglodytes(thanks to mr. burns) who are peddling their fear with dollar signs in their eyes. Yes, Liberals do the same thing! So without further digressing....<br />Al Franken's book is funny. Whether you are on the right or the so-called left you should a get a laugh out of it. If you aren't laughing, then its obvious you live in Tunnelville, OK. He makes some strong points regarding Ann Coulter and yes folks I believe this woman is a complete psycho in my opinion. I shudder to think anyone with half a brain would take anything she says as truth, much less entertainment. I digress again. The book is well written and is quite funny. The book does not slow at any point and you will find yourself not wanting to put it down. The liberal media chapter is probably my favorite because I have always pointed out that no biased is proven, and Al Franken gives us some fine examples to understand what is going on. Of course what is going on is fear, fear sells in this country and Conservatives(not all!) manipulate fear to gain votes and sell books.<br />Buy this book whether you agree or not. It is fun and a joy to read. If it pisses you off and gets you all wound up whether you are on the right or left then you are a complete loser. The fact is, reading a simple book like this should not enrage you. It should entertain you with some great points regarding just how stupid we are here in America. If you want to be enraged, just look at Bush's tax plan and what it does to veterans, that should enrage you., that should enrage you.	2003-09-03

A self-avowed liberal with a bit of backbone who isn't afraid to duke it out with the rabid dogs of the right.  Franken gleefully exposes (and abundantly documents) the lies (slander, some might say) of such shrill \\"conservatives\\" as Ann Coulter.  One small example: Ms. Coulter was born in 1961 or in 1963, depending on which of her driver's licenses you believe.  But if the younger age is correct (as she now claims) then she committed voter fraud by registering and voting as a 16 year old.  And this is who we have lecturing America on slander and treason???<br />The primary weakness of this book, for which I deduct one star, is that Franken's uneven mix of indignation and humor sometimes makes it difficult to separate his sarcasm from what he's really trying to say.  I would have deducted another star because the author sometimes comes across as fanatical and shrill as the right-wing loonies he's skewering, but heck, given the enormous hypocrisy he has exposed in them, I might be a bit shrill too!<br />Conservatives might want to read this book too, as it reveals that many of the people purporting to speak for them are doing a grave disservice to true conservativism in this country and will ultimately do it great harm.  Coulter and her cronies on the right have discovered that Jerry Springer-style politics sells, and whether they're in it for the attention or the money, they're making lots of money off of your credulity.  (I suppose I'll be labeled \\"treasonous\\" for suggesting that as Americans we can and ought to do much, much better than this.)<br />BTW special thanks to Fox for bringing this book to my attention.<br />(I've edited my review after reading through some of the other reviews.  Many of the negative, one-star reviews accuse Franken of lying himself.  Well, it's time to put up or shut up.  Where are these lies?  What has Franken said in this book that isn't true?  Has he, or hasn't he, amply demonstrated that many, many outspoken members of thefar right are playing fast and loose with the truth, and that the so-called liberal mainstream media have largely accepted their version?  Thundering silence.  I am giving back the one star I rescinded, in light of how much this book has pissed off a lot of people who can't quite seem to prove anything in it untrue.  Every such review simply proves the truth of everything Franken has said in this book.)	2003-09-03

Thank you, FOX!  As it was, I made a point of buying it immediately after reading the article about the lawsuit, which FOX lost, BTW.<br />Let's start with the title.  This book is not meant to be any more \\"fair and balanced\\" than Fox news is, which should tell you a lot right there.  It is meant to be, and succeeds brilliantly, at being an exhaustively documented, meticulously prepared indictment of the lies (yes, just plain ol' lies) the \\"right\\" regurgitates into the public discourse.  Franken skewers everyone with the deserved venom that perhaps only an accomplished satirist can bring to bear.  But don't feel sorry for them -- they deserve it.  Their calculated lies, boorishness, coarseness, bullying tactics and lack of civility make them fair game.  (You may be shocked at what some of these self-proclaimed \\"Christians\\" do and say. . . although, then again, you may not.)  I suppose the wounded howling will begin soon from the \\"right\\" about how they've been so unfairly mistreated here. . . well, no worse than they treated anyone on the left, the only difference being that Franken isn't lying.  But that's the way bullies are.<br />Fair warning: although the laughs are plentiful, this book is nowhere near as light-hearted as \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.\\"  If anything this book will make you sad that this class of people have actually gained power and a modicum of respectability...	2003-09-03

I read every word in 3 days! <br />I hope people listen to his message to Democrats and others about how we need to call these insane people on their distortions and mean-spirited, irrational approach to politics.<br />And of course the book is funny!  <br />Al Franken is vicious to people who deserve it, and he is kind (well, retroactively in a couple of cases) to those who aren't actually bad folks, but with whom he disagrees. He's also willing to admit when he jumped to a hasty conclusion, and he apologizes.<br />I couldn't believe some bozo from Slate said in an interview that people don't really read this book.

Al tells it like it is and debunks all the lies of the right so well.  While it is presented in a funny, easy to read way, it is also based on fact.<br />Think about it, what is the right's response?  They can't defend their lies so they call him names (and try to shut him down with \\"wholly without merit lawsuits.) <br />The neo-cons are afraid (that's why they are always so angry) and you watch - they won't actually defend themselves or challenge any of his assertions - they can't. They will do what they always do - use ad hominem attacks because the sad part is the right wing believers won't notice the difference -they never do. <br />Franken hurls plenty of insults himself of course, but at least he produces the facts to go with the insults.<br />He basically gives the right a big spoonful of their own medicine and they don't like it.<br />I like the way he easily exposes Hannity's lies and hypocracy.  But my favorite part is the fictional \\"Operation Chicken hawk\\" story. It is just as funny in this book as it is in his \\"Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot.\\"<br />I hope he never stops doing what he is doing,<br />Well done Al!	2003-09-03

Buy one for yourself and then copies for your family and friends.  I am.  <br />It moves quickly, in tight, entertaining, and fact heavy chapters (averaging about 8 or so pages each).  It has a good sense of pace, includes everything from a description of the \\"O'Reilly incident\\" to an 11 page comic strip.  And as far as I can tell the book, each joke, each jab, each peeling away of the layers of propaganda to get at lies, is fact checked from here to next Sunday.  While I enjoy a good-humored comedy, I especially enjoy hard fact type books.  But don't let that scare you off, it is very easy to read, fun and provocative (and it gets your blood pumping at lots of points - and not in the O'Reilly \\"Those Who Trespass\\" sense either).<br />Basically, Franken takes a number of well known conservative commentators to task, pointing out their, well, lies in support of the Republicans, or rather, Bush and the Administration (at one point he mentions he likes McCain - and even backs THAT assertion up with an anecdote).  Then he moves in on the Administration.  Ann Coulter, Billy O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and other rather familiar faces get dissected.  The same treatment is given to the White House, from the tax cuts, the military and various other policies that were presented to the public in ways that were, well, lies.<br />Everything is meticulously footnoted and features a 19 page section of Endnotes (and not just to provide the punchline for an Ann Coulter joke on page 12).  In chapter 22, I Grow Discouraged About the Tone, Franken presents Karl Rove as a rather disagreeable, foul mouthed fellow (in fact, many direct quotes from Administration big wigs feature four letter words) and the White House staff as have a \\"lack of even basic policy knowledge, and the only casual interest in knowing more...\\"  Now, that quote is not an opinion from Franken, but his quote of a source, John DiIulio, one time head of Bush's Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.  In the endnotes section, chapter 22 has seven instances of `notes and sources' including the fact the full text of DiIulio's memo was obtained from the Drudge Report.  The jokes aren't only funny, the lies exposed aren't only outrageous, but they are also well documented.  Nothing is going to come back to bite Franken when he calls someone out.<br />The pacing is very good, starting out on a silly note, sliding into some hard and funny exposure, but then, somewhat surprisingly, moving into some serious territory.  The Wellstone Memorial is bitingly portrayed, frankly confirming my feeling at the time - it was a wonderful service that featured a few seconds of questionable politicking by people who were as motivated by their grief as much as anything else.  This chapter alone is worth the book (especially if you don't really like humor too much - just get it because of this).  The twists the conservative media put on it, to make it appear as the now understood \\"Maoist reeducation camp\\", are fully exposed.  It moves into some more sillyness, including the comic book section, and ends on a chuckle, sort of kidding on the square (read the book to figure that one out).<br />There are a couple of slow spots later in the book, and I really wanted a different end to the \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" episode.  But, over all, this is a great work. Everyone, even Republicans concerned about the direction our nation is going (and have thick skins) needs to read this book.	2003-09-02

This book should be read by everyone who loves the U.S. The laughs are constant--on average, I laughed out loud at something on nearly every page. But the real purpose of the book is to instruct.

Note to the skeptics: in this book, Al and TeamFranken expose, as the title says, Lies and the Lying Liars.  It is NOT merely a trashing of conservatives, like Coulter trashes Democrats en masse, but a look at the truth about people such as Ms. Coulter, Hannity, and the aforementioned O'Reilly.  With actual facts and research, not cliches and well, slander.  I hope everyone who read books such as &quot;Let Freedom Ring&quot; and &quot;Slander&quot; will read this book instead.

Al Franken has written a book that is a rock-solid foundation for moving forward with a stronger, less poisonous national discourse, turning the slings and arrows of the Right back on themselves with logic, fact, and humor. Not only an easy and entertaining read, this is a serious look at political discourse in this country. Al takes on subjects from Clinton-bashing all the way to Coulter, O'Reilly, and Fox News with impeccable fact checking from the amazing TeamFranken. Democratic candidates should be calling Al with requests to quote his book in their speeches!<br />Al Franken is the perfect combination of comic, intellectual, and critic, and if the nation continues its fall from grace, world leadership, and prosperity, it won't be because Al Franken neglected his duty as a patriotic, intelligent, thinking American.	2003-09-02

Personally, I would have no interest in a \\"liberal Rush Limbaugh\\" and I doubt any fans of Al Franken would either.<br />This would have been a best-seller even without Fox News' lawsuit for good reason.

It makes clear that the political right could not have achieved its present power without resorting to systematic and shameless lying.  It also makes an implicit criticism of the mainline media.  The technique of the right that Franken describes is to plant a completely false story and allow the newspapers and television news programs that are supposedly neutral but have been excessively credulous to pass them on as fact.  Thus it happens that even I, who am opposed to the Bush administration, believed, for example, that Clintonites trashed executive offices before leaving them and that the Wellstone memorial degenerated into a tasteless political event.  Both stories were fabrications solemnly passed on by mainstream media.  Moreover, Franken demonstrates that the lies of the right cover up policies that are destructive of the general welfare, the economy, the environment, and even of national security.  On the last issue, supposedly Bush's strong suit, he shows how the administration failed to act on warnings from the Clinton  administration about al Qaeda and the need for an Office of Homeland Security until 9/11.  The terrible truth is that 9/11 might have been preventable by a more intelligent administration.  This is not a faultless book.  Franken's fantasy in which he imagines how the chickenhawks of this administration might have behaved if they had  actually served in the Vietnam war is entertaining but not really a contribution to his message. Still, with its humor and with the great help that it got from Fox News, this book will reach millions who will not read more solemn works that make many of the same points.	2003-09-02

First it was Rush (remember him?) who received the skewering, now it is Fox News and All Coulter. I just don't think it could have been targeted at a nicer group of people. From the twisted lies of our current President and his henchmen that have landed us in the current messes we are in to the ways in which media is corrupted by a few greedy [people] (Rupert Murdoch and Richard Mellon Scaife are names that come to mind), Al gets his man (or woman in the case of that Coulter skank). My personal favorite is the Wolfowitz retort to Al commenting on what a great job Clinton's military had done in Afghanistan. A prime example of one of our nation's great minds at work...<br />One thing I hope that readers of the conservative persuasion will note is that Al and his student helpers have documented all their statements with factual references. This means they actually took place!!! This contrasts with the fairy tales written by Hannity, Coulter, and O'Reilly.<br />I hope one of the Democratic candidates who runs against Alfred E.

A breath of fresh air (and truth) to take my mind off of the insidious and rediculous rantings of Ann Coulter (what is wrong with her?) and Sean Hannity.  Not only do Al and the Harvaard researchers that make up TeamFranken manage to discredit the lies of Coulter and Hannity, but those of the Bush administration and many other right-wingers as well.  Although it is a wonderful political read in itself, the humor of Franken makes it ten times more enjoyable.  You learn things that every informed American should know, like the fact that Ann Coulter is nuts.  It's easily one of the best books I've ever read and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's sick of right-wing lies and especially those who aren't.  In the end of all this, the joke is truly on Bill O'Reilly (also a liar) for suing Franken (because &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot; is supposedly his intellectual property) owing to the fact that it only served to boost the sales of the book he so adamantly hates.	2003-09-02

A feeling in the pit of my gut.  I just couldn't articulate it.  Luckily, Al Franken, along with the graciously credited 'Team Franken', has pulled it together for me.  I am being fed a line of swill direct from the 'liberal media' designed to turn me in to another Bush-whacked droid.  I always had a feeling I shouldn't buy into it.  Now I have proof.  A 'guru' of fact.<br />The best part of this book is that, unlike 'conservative' (or liberal??) talk radio, print media, FNC, etc., Franken requres me to think for myself.  He states his case, and backs it up with good research.  At no time does he have an expectation that his reader will accept his premise simply because he states it in print.<br />He also makes me laugh.  Really hard.  It also scares me a lot.

I<BR>want to shout it from the rooftops: BUY THIS BOOK!! It is a<BR>masterpiece! <br />It is the most well-written, simply written, devastatingly<BR>sharp \\"nailing\\" of the lies by Bush, Cheney, O'Reilly, Coulter,<BR>Hannity, the whole Fox network, and on and on. Franken just may be the re-incarnation of Tom Paine -- or posssibly our own Lech Walesa. Several wonderful books have come out recently that I have read or am reading, like Conason's Big Lies, but THIS book, I believe, has the potential to be the first real shot to topple the evil right wing empire that has stolen America right out from under us -- the empire that is, irony of all ironies, trying<BR>to make it into a mirror image of the late unlamented Soviet Union, a place where anyone who questions the ruling powers is labeled a \\"traitor\\" and bullied or banished into silence. <br />This book -- I am not in any way related to or employed by Al Franken or his publisher and get nothing out of writing this -- is up there with J'Accuse and Candide among the great political books of all time. <br />What puts this ahead is that it's so well-written, so clear and easy to follow, and delivered with real grace and humor. You HAVE to lighten this material up sometimes, otherwise it would get so horribly depressing and turgid, people would just get overwhelmed and turn off. It is also so jam-packed with specifics about right-wing lies. For this, Franken gives due credit to his amazing team of 14 Harvard grad student researchers, who helped dig up all this dirt. (I hope you'll give them lots of money from the royalties too, Al! Except maybe the guy from the ultra-wealthy family!)<br />If you buy this book, you won't have to sputter when you talk to a dittoheaded or no-spin-zoned relative. Instead, you can take apart what he or she says and show it to be the lie that it is. <br />This isabsolutely required reading for any and every Democratic activist. It should be read and studied, it<BR>should be given out to every person who goes to the Democratic<BR>convention next summer. Read this, and you will be outraged, and fired up, and also happy, because somebody is really, really, really laying it out on the line what's happened. <br />Read the chapter on how<BR>Bush is absolutely, positively at fault for completely ignoring all the warnings of a terrorist attack (including knowing that Al Qaeda wanted to hijack planes and fly them into buildings), but blamed Clinton. Read how the right wing deliberately lied about and \\"spun\\" Wellstone's FUNERAL to win the Minnesota senatorial race.<br />There really IS a terrible right wing conspiracy, and it's really<BR>bad -- no, it's even worse than you probably think it is. The supposedly \\"liberal\\" media has aided and abetted this attack on American democracy. And it's ALL HERE. GO NOW and BUY THE BOOK. It is likely to make history.	2003-09-02

Great revues from the New York Times would be expected, but don't buy the book if you are a serious follower of politics. It's mean spirited and fluffy.	2003-09-02

Why not stand on the fence and watch the Hatfields and McCoys take shots at each other? Finally, however, here is a book that actually lives up to its name. While Mr. Franken is definitely a liberal (nothing wrong with that, neither is anything wrong with Ann Coulter being a conservative), he does listen and allow arguments from both sides to be discussed. That being said, Mr. Franken's book is absolutely hilarious. I found myself reading it in public and laughing so hard and some of his observations that I was given funny looks (apparently books are not to be laughed at one man told me as he watched Bill O'Reilly). Now, I will admit that I would not have bought this book if it weren't for Fox suing Franken (I believe in Libraries, sorry Mr. Franken) but I am definitely glad that I bought this book. Let's look at some of the aspects of this book:<br />To begin with, I am glad someone finally stood up and reponded to Ms. Coulter and her rabid attacks. There is standing up for your politics...and then there is all out war. While I would not necessarily use Mr. Franken's description, I do completely agree with him about endnotes. That was one of the problems that I had with her last book. Though at times his stories can seem to be drifting into almost attacking the members of the right, he deftly approaches the line, only to use humor to show that he can actually poke fun at some of his ideas. Still, from his candid look at the last presidential election to his explanation of the war of words between himself and Bill O'Reilly (and I must admit that I laughed very hard at the idea of Mr. Franken eliciting the response of &quot;Shut up, shut up&quot; from a man that usually seems so composed as Mr. O'Reilly), the examples that Mr. Franken give makes the reader truly think about what the direction of the country is right now. Other sections look at the events leading up to and the fallout from 9/11, aswell as rating the President's actions with regards to the environment, the economy, and religion (here's a hint...not so good, but his observations on why are hysterically funny and in alot of cases...eye-opening). Perhaps I am twisting the overall meaning of the book a little bit (I guess you could say that I am putting my own media spin on it), but it seems that Mr. Franken is saying that instead of letting someone like him or members of the media tell you what to think, you need to go out, find out the facts for yourself (and that's all the facts, not just what one source tells you) and make up your own mind, rather than let someone tell you how to think. <br />Overall, this book is a quick read that is hilariously poignant and asks the reader to examine how they came to think their thoughts about politics. Well done. I highly recommend it.	2003-09-02

No matter what one's political affiliation may be, Al Franken provides witty and hilarious observations in his books and this one is no exception.  I borrowed \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations\\" from my cousin about seven years ago. Although I was a Limbaugh fan and a Republican at the time, I was curious as to what was in the book since I was hearing mostly one side of issues. I was rolling.  I still remember some of the funny pieces in the book that brought tears to my eyes.  I am no longer political, but cannot resist checking out this new book.  Liberals, of course, will relish in it but conservatives should take a look at it also because Franken is not just a comedian.  He researches his observations and puts great thought in his ideas.  Conservatives also need to be able to laugh at themselves.  I saw Franken and Bill O'Reilly of the O'Reilly Factor on a panel discussion a few weeks back and O'Reilly kept throwing angry insults at Franken after Franken clearly caught O'Reilly giving false information about a program O'Reilly was involved in winning a Peabody award (one of the \\"lies\\" found in this book).  O'Reilly did not come off well.  The \\"liars\\" discovered in this book should lighten up and admit they made a mistake if they are in the wrong.  No one is perfect.  It seems that the attacks waged on Franken's books are not on the validity of the information but on the presentation (i.e. the less than tactful titles of his books).  But, as is well-known, one should not judge a book by its cover, and Franken's works are insightful and thought-provoking as well as hilarious!	2003-09-02

A year ago, I would have considered myself a die hard Republican.  But, what a difference a year makes.  It all started with &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; and Michael Moore's look into the American culture of fear.  Something with that movie resonated with me.  It got me thinking on a more basic level about the things I believe in.  Enter &quot;Al Franken:  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.&quot;  This book has helped me to even further sort out many of the things I hold as important.  <br />This book is funny, entertaining, educational, and at times a bit twisted (kidding on the square--read the book, you'll understand).   For my money, the chapter on Bob Jones University is worth the price of the book by itself.  I'm still trying to keep an open mind with view to the two major political parties in this country.  This book does help balance out a lot of what the right has put in my mind.  If you are a Republican, I challenge you to read it just to gain some perspective.  If you are a Democrat, read it for the great writing.<br />And as there doesn't seem to be any reviews of this book yet, I am hopefully going to have the proud distinction of being the first.<br />Excellent book, Mr. Franken, from a new fan!!	2003-09-02

I bought Al Franken's book primarily as a protest vote against Fox's \\"wholly without merit\\" lawsuit before Fox dropped it in embarrassment.  Also as a vote against the ultra-right-wing political lies Franken promised to expose.  And in the hope that \\"Lies and the Lying Liars...\\" would top Amazon's best-seller list and inspire other truth-telling authors and commentators to grow some cohones, get an attitude, and rail against the scary conservative tilt in current government. <br />Once I started reading it, though, I couldn't put it down.  Finished in a couple of days still wanting more. Appreciated its thorough research (aided by a crew of Harvard brains) backed by footnotes, direct quotes, and clear and irrefutable cites of source publications, dates, speeches, TV shows...  <br />I found the book funny and an easy read, with the author's quirky comedic personality showing through, yet the book was enlightening and reflected a depth of thought far beyond the kind of mindless name-calling you're likely to hear on talk radio.  <br />One caution: It also  got me angrier than I already was regarding President Dubya Bush's miserably failed term, more convinced of his lack of scruples, seething at the underhanded tactics and truth-bending of his apologists and supporters, and even more discouraged about our current state of affairs with the current political \\"leadership.\\"  <br />It also tipped me over the edge toward throwing my energy behind Dubya's defeat in the '04 election (and I've never been politically active or outspoken before).  <br />In short: An excellent book; I recommend buying several copies and passing them out to friends and relatives ASAP (mine's already promised to my oldest son, who will vote for the first time next month in California).  Caution, though: you'll enjoy its unvarnished truth and wry humor, but if you're someone who can think critically you'll also be infuriated by the lies and by the lying liars it exposes.	2003-09-02

The book, in fact, gained some undue publicity because of that title. Fox News recently tried to sue Franken for using the words \\"fair and balanced,\\" claiming that they had copyrighted those words as a trademark for their news broadcast. Franken, almost literally, laughed the case out of court.<br />However, that's one of the few genuine laughs the book earns. Franken tries hard--a bit too hard, at times--to humorously point out many of the distortions made by notable conservatives to support their beliefs. Franken doesn't pick on insignificant targets, either--his grouping of \\"The Right\\" includes Rush Limbaugh, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly (on whom he spends an inordinate amount of time), and the current President and Vice-President, among many others.<br />Based on the many inconsistencies documented here, Franken could have presented them straightforwardly and had quite a case. But there are two big problems with Franken's style. First, his intended humor is writ very large, as evidenced in the book's title. It isn't enough for Franken to present a point comedically--he has to repeat it and beat it to death, like a combination of Dennis Miller and Mel Brooks.<br />The second problem is that Franken appears to have as self-serving of an agenda as the people he tries to satirize. Throughout the book, he continuously refers to his careers as an \\"SNL\\" writer (at one point describing a '70s sketch he wrote that has nothing to do with the subject at hand) and as a \\"comedian\\" for corporate presentations. After a while, it starts to sound like Bob Hope complaining about the generals who hired him to do USO shows.<br />The book isn't painful to read, and some of its barbs are well-deserved. But if Franken had taken most of his overworked satire out of the book, it would have been half as long and twice as readable. As it stands, \\"Lies\\" is very difficult to take (you should pardon the expression) seriously.hired him to do USO shows.<br />The book isn't painful to read, and some of its barbs are well-deserved.

But even if the worst is yet to come, this collection of slapstick humor and wisecracks is tilted enough to assure that its subtitle -- A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right -- should only be said between snickers or with tongue planted firmly in cheek.<br />I don't differ with most aspects of author Al Franken's political agenda. He makes important points regarding the GOP's reliance on \\"Clinton bashing\\" as a fallback explanation for almost anything that goes awry. And I have always enjoyed seeing political figures with the spotlight placed on their job-related lies and misrepresentations, something that Mr. Franken's eager team of Harvard researchers seems adept at uncovering. In my opinion, the basic ideas behind his views on the Bush tax cuts, the war in Iraq, and election strategies come close to the mark.<br />But I wonder why it is so hard to produce some kind of thoughtful and intelligent partisan discussion these days, something biting and serious but written well enough to capture the public's imagination. By that standard, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them falls flat on its face. The book instead settles for being Mr. Franken's latest self-centered treatise with another title that sounds as if it was written by an R-rated Dr. Seuss and filled with arguments pat enough that they could fit into word balloons over the heads of teenage comic book characters.

And a funny guy, too.<br />While too many lazy pundits and journalists are content to spend their careers rewriting press releases or simply making things up, Franken spent a lot of time and effort investigating, analyzing and finally debunking the ocean of lies, half-truths and distortions that get hosed in our faces every day by the illegitimate Bush Administration and the right-wing-dominated news media that act as its mouthpiece. He also gives us some good laughs as he does it.<br />When I watch talking heads vomit their viciousness on TV, rehashing worn-out lies even after being caught, I wonder: why doesn't anyone call them on it? When I see White House Occupant Bush telling us how great it will be for the bottom 90% of Americans to empty their pockets into the hands of the richest 10%, I wonder: why won't any well-known person counter him? When I witness giant corporations pour almost as much money into the pockets of EPA employees as they pour toxins into our air, water and land, I wonder: what air-breathing, water-drinking, ground-stomping person can expose their misdeeds with the spotlight of publicity, in such a way that people will actually listen? Now I have my answer: live from New York, it's Al Franken!<br />If you're liberal, read this book; it will give you good talking points for your next discussion with someone who isn't.

So comb your hair and sit up straight.<br />Finally, if you really want to get your blood boiling, also read \\"The Best Democracy Money can Buy,\\" by Greg Palast.

A goldmine of comedy relief for these grim times, Al Franken also has some serious issues to address, mainly the myth of a &quot;liberal media&quot;-and when he reminisces about his friend, the late senator Paul Wellstone, he's sincerely poignant-but for the most part, it's enough laughs to carry you all the way to 2004.  Illustrated with facts, footnotes and some mind-bogglingly great first-person anecdotes that expose an awful lot of hypocrisy, cheating and, yes, plain old lying from many prominent pundits and politicians of the right-wing in America.  Some of the chapters are pure parody, such as the brilliantly funny &quot;Supply-side Jesus&quot; piece, done in a Mad-magazine-style comic book format, and &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot;, which imagines the scene if all of our most high-ranking republican draft-avoiders, including George Bush, had actually gone to Vietnam.

Most of the book is what I would call humor laced with anger and a touch of indignation. <br />Franken essentially confirms what intelligent people already know: That FOX is a conservative propaganda machine, and Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity are just caricatures of the network. What I found most disturbing are the accounts of Ann Coulture's and Karl Rove's work. Conservatives, liberals and everyone in between should read this book, if for no other reason, to understand what these two people stand for and represent. No Republican or Democrat should want either of these scumbags on board with their cause.<br />Again, even if you are a conservative you should give this book a try. It will probably make you angry, but it will make you think - especially in terms of how the media as a whole operates. Franken's criticism of the media's laziness, love of negativity and sensationalism is very thought-provoking. I finished this book with a more clear sense of just how overtly the media insults the intelligence of the American public. <br />Franken can be heavy handed and biased, but he always backs it up with facts - something Ann Coulture does not feel any obligation to do for her readers.	2003-09-02

Laughs, that is, for those who aren't being plainly shown for the lying, power-mad slime they are, here, in this fine book. <br />  In stark contrast to the liars profiled within, Al Franken provides real, hard evidence for his allegations. This book would serve as a fine jumping-off place for many a discussion with these conservative zealots who lie and distort...let's see them try and wiggle out of these!<br />   Be prepared for mind-blowing revelations, Schadenfreude galore, and many a belly-laugh, all at the expense of those who belong beneath the Rock of Obscurity.	2003-09-02

The tone of this book is sacastic and angry because Franken is just that and its about time that someone challenged these free market moonies who have mixed their beliefs of free enterprise,jesus and world domination together to create the 51st state of revolution, IRAQ.  Question for Al . .  when Jesus comes again . .  will he have to be converted to Christianity before he can go back?  If you loved his book about Rush, you'll love this one.

After you read this book, you'll never again listen to Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the right wing liars the same way.<br />Above all, this book is a call to arms.

(Ann Coulter, as an unintentional comedian, does not count).  But PJ O'Rourke for the Rs and Al Franken for the Ds are the fairest-minded, most intelligent and effective spokesmen either side has. In this book Franken takes on neocon pundits and pols and kills 'em with a deadly combination of facts and wit.  The book analyzes writings and public comments by a number of prominent conservatives and more than proves them wrong -- it proves multiple statements to be knowingly wrong, that is, falsehoods aka lies. If Ann Coulter is actually willing to show her face in public after this book, she truly does have something wrong with her. Franken is kinder, oddly, to Bill O'Reilly whose fit of pique about being called a liar allegedly (according to the New Yorker and other sources) is the reason for an ill-fated Fox lawsuit which immediately caused me, and with luck countless others, to buy the book.  Not all the shots at every target are compelling, to be honest, and on some counts (notably Bernie Goldberg), the analysis seems rather selective. But Franken is never less than hilarious. And when Franken hits, boy he hits splendidly. A must read for anyone who is worried about where the country is going and the Republican party's shift from the party of Lincoln to the mouths that are stinkin'.	2003-09-01

Problem is, so many prominent right wingers these days have either 1) become enamoured with the trut-impaired types of Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly or 2) don't care and like their dogmatic red meat any way that it is served up. But, if you are a conservative, you probably ought  if only becasue it is the truth, not the party line (everyone say \\"da\\" now) that will set you free. And in the case of Franken's book, it will make you laugh even if you disagree (well, perhaps). (And, yes, there are conservatives I respect and love. For example, the late Barry Goldwater, George Will, my father, Robert \\"Prince of Darkness\\" Novak, etc. In each case, I may disagree with them, but they aren't pathologizal liars.) The nice thing and Franken is that this book not only makes you laugh out loud, but he makes a sound case for how much crap passes as conservative fact.

Frothing at the mouth, chewing on the furnature ANGRY.  He has cause to be.  The conservative right has been lying and getting away with it.  This does not sit well with Mr. Franken.  So he compiled a list of all the people who piss him off (conservative pundits and politicos mostly) and began to tear into them.  <br />It is difficult to underplay the horrific nature of the beating he dishes out.  Using the sneaky tools you would expect from a former SNL comedian (a phone, a computer and a team of Harvard research assistants) he sought out all the places his targets had knowingly lied, and exposed them.  <br />Disturbingly, you get the impression that his editors reigned him in.  He occassionally summerizes his lists of grevences beyond the material he covers.  <br />For all you fans of Ann Coulter, you will be glad to know Mr. Franken spends two chapters on Ms. Coulter.  One is titled 'Ann Couter: Nut.'  Look on the top right corner of the book cover, just above the Bill O'Riley head shot.  See her?<br />Speaking of Mr. O'Riley, if you are a fan of his, then be carefull picking up this book.  It may explode in your hands.  It seems Mr. Franken was able to document a number of falsehoods propagated by Mr. O'Riley, as well as having an intense personal dislike of the man.  Bully is the nicest thing he calls him.<br />Bottom line: it is erudite, funny, scholarly, savage, rude, highly personal and it is about damn time such a work was published.

Ordinarily, reviewing right-wing lies is as much fun as cleaning out a stopped toilet but the humor makes it possible to review the spew.<br />Having discussed politics for years in USENET groups, I was surprised by how many times Al's book provided material that directly punctured right-wing fantasies with facts and data. Al's book provides the information needed to challenge the right-wing editors and libertarians who nearly dominate the TV guest seats. As Al's book becomes more widely read, they will not be as happy to take call-in questions on C-SPAN in the future.<br />With forty-three chapters and 354 pages, not everyone of them is a zinger. For example, chapter 29, \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One,\\" didn't work because it too closely copies O'Reilly's style. Right-wing propaganda copied too closely even in parody becomes Stalinist unfunny and down right boring ... even Al can not breath life into that corpse.<br />Perhaps the most telling aspect is last week, \\"Lies (And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them) A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\\" was in the 'Political' section of a national book chain and this weekend, it is sold out and Al Franken's previous books have been moved to the 'Humor' section. What could not be accomplished in the court house is being accomplished by a faceless, chain store executive or the local manager.

First and foremost, Lies is filled with Franken's brilliant wit and sarcasm that make it nearly impossible to put the book down.  Franken takes on the myth that the media has a liberal bias, providing well-organized and painstakingly well-researched (by TeamFranken) facts that make for a jarring response.  No stones are left unturned, whether in print, radio or television.  More fascinating is the exposing of the blatant lies, illicit tactics and hypocrisy from Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich, GW Bush, and many others.  Whether outright lies (O'Reilly and his \\"awards\\") or cleverly crafted distortions (shady endnotes to deceitful charts), Franken lays it all out in a factual and humorous manner.  Though defending myths about the Liberal in America, there are a few Democrats who end up getting their fair share of \\"Franken-sense\\".  Religion, Economics, Republican Vietnam War dodging, and the truth about Terrorism all finds its place in one of the best books I've read in years.  Al's long-standing place in politics, journalism and television certainly make for countless anecdotes found in this work; some outrageously funny, others surprisingly touching.

It was somewhat of a surprise as political tomes tend to be a little intense and not always very readable.  This book is a welcome exception.  Al mixes humor and personal anecdotes with well researched (and verifiable) information to shine light on some pillars of the American right including Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter and, of course, George W. Bush.  Not simply a reporting of information found on the internet with Google and Lexus-Nexus searches (although there is plenty of that), Al includes meetings, phone conversations and , yes, even investigative reporting (his undercover sting at Bob Jones University, while not his finest moment, made for a great story).  But make no mistake, this book raises and carefully documents a number issues that are more than a little disturbing if you care at all about the truth in government and media.

It is easy to dismiss books like this because they are \\"written by comedians\\" or \\"focus on criticisms rather than solutions\\", but I found that Mr. Franken did an excellent job of presenting the real facts while exposing the hypocrisy behind the right-wing media.

It's slanted, it's populist, it's downright leftist. It's also the truth. I just saw the video on CSPAN of the Book Expo lunch at which Al Franken and Bill O'Reilly tore into each other. The scene is accurately described in the book, along with lots of frightening and disturbing examples of blatant deception in the right-wing media. But somehow it stays funny. Really funny! Franken makes it clear in several places that he doesn't hate all conservatives (He even claims Gary Bauer isn't a nutcase, though he acknowledges that he is in fact small.) He seems to have great respect for diversity of ideas and civil discourse. But when the right lies, Franken takes them to task. And he does it brilliantly. If you believe everything Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly says, you will hate this book. But if you feel like the political center of this country has been yanked toward the right, and you have been wondering when someone would cry foul, this book is for you.	2003-09-01

Usually, I've found him mildly funny at best. But he stood up to the Fox Network, who found him such a threat that they sued him on the grounds that they owned the words \\"fair and balanced\\" (now that's funny), so I felt like buying his book was the least I could do. And to my surprise, I found myself enjoying it. No, by the standards of commedians, he's kind of run-of-the-mill. But by the standards of political commentary--where a guy like Rush Limbaugh is regarded as funny--Al Franken is hilarious. And under the humor is some real meat. He does an excellent job of documenting how the right wing has elevated character assassination and lying into a political tool powerful enough to elect a president. Along the way, he demolishes the myths of the liberal press, Al Gore's exaggerations, and Clinton being soft on terrorism. I was sorry that he didn't devote a bit more space to the lies being told about Hillary Clinton, but maybe he's saving his ammo in case she ever does decide to run for  President.<br />Franken is at his best when going head-to-head against right wing extremists like Coulter, Limbaugh, and O'Reilly, although it's a bit like shooting fish in a bucket. I didn't much care for the \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\" chapter, in which he shares his vision of what might have happened if draft-dodging hawks like Bush, O'Reilley, and Gingrich had actually gone to Viet Nam (they end up fragging John Kerry). This is more the old Franken. Stick with the facts, Al.<br />It is welcome to see the lies and exaggerations of the right met with some righteous anger. Still, Franken cannot really match the bile of those he attacks. You never get the feeling that he actually hates these guys the way they clearly hate so much about America. Perhaps that is a good thing.	2003-09-01

If you admire any of those numbskulls, I BEG you to read this book and see if you feel the same way afterward.  Franken (and his top-notch Harvard research team) puts Coulter and her Cro Magnon, conservative cronies through the ringer and (unlike Coulter) uses FACTS to back it all up. Page after page is filled with quotes, transcripts, and documents proving without a doubt that the whole \\"Fox News\\" (there's an oxymoron!) crowd is more crooked that the Nixon Administration.<BR>But \\"Lies\\" is more than just a conservative smack-down.  It's also one of the funniest books since, well, since Franken's last book.  In the spirit of other great social commentators like Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce, Al Franken makes you laugh, think, then laugh some more. <BR>The right-wing has continually lied and exploited tragedies like 9/11 to instill fear and blind obedience into the American public.

Take it to the prom.<br />Franken's comedic aim has always been scattershot, but that's often a necessity when you're aiming for moving targets. Here, his raging humor (or humorous rage, if you like) benefits from a coherence and focus that helps him score an impressive number of bulls-eyes.<br />Franken has a good journalist's ear for the revealing anecdote and the telling quote. Solid research builds Franken's case for the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of contemporary American conservatism. Incisive wit makes his argument entertaining. Sweet reason makes his indictment of right-wing politicians and media personalities persuasive and compelling.<br />In the interests of \\"fair and balanced\\" commentary, some of the book's sharpest criticism is reserved for the \\"liberal\\" media. Franken contends-and demonstrates-that the media is not so much biased as lazy. Shallow, self-important and self-aggrandizing, journalists working for large media conglomerates are easily manipulated by cynical political operatives, missing real stories in their rush for scandal, sensation and, of course, profit.<br />One of the oldest--and most odious--tactics in the history of politics is to impugn the patriotism of one's political opponents.  True patriotism asserts that such tactics dishonor this nation. True patriotism honestly confronts the kind of jingoistic, self-serving, self-righteous lies that threaten the future of our republic. True patriotism is imaginative and optimistic about what people of good will can accomplish through representative democracy.<br />\\"Lies (And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them)\\" is, then, a truly patriotic work. It's also damned funny.  Buy it.	2003-09-01

His delivery, equal parts humor and fact, is mostly spot-on and makes this book laugh-out-loud funny, even when it's curl-up-and-cry truthful. <br />Franken begins with Ann Coulter (and an amusing section called \\"How To Lie With Footnotes\\"), moves on to Fox News (covering Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly) and finally goes after the current administration for its lies. He maintains a good distinction between mainstream and right-wing media -- an accurate description of journalism in this country -- that fairly assigns responsibility among the players.<br />All throughout Franken peppers the chapters with amusing anecdotes and his personal experiences with the people he writes about. His run-ins with the blustering Hannity and meek colmes are particularly entertaining.<br />The book starts out stronger than it finishes, and some of the last chapters feel a bit out-of-place, which is why I'm giving only 4 stars. The chapter that satirizes many prominent right-wing figures by casting them in a fictional Vietnam squad detracts from the book, which otherwise relies on reality to make its points. Much like in his earlier work, \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big, Fat Idiot,\\" \\"Lies\\" veers crazily at the end, to poor effect.<br />But those criticisms are minor because, as a whole, \\"Lies\\" is quite a joy to read. I recommend \\"Lies\\" to anyone who has been exposed to media and politics, on both sides of the aisle. It sheds a great deal of light on the manipulation of the political system by the right-wing media and it exposes O'Reilly, Hannity, even President Bush telling outrageous, but mostly unchecked, lies.	2003-09-01

Make no mistake, at the end of the day, unlike &quot;Why Not Me&quot; and &quot;Oh, the Things I Know&quot;, whicih were more on the comedy side, this book is about mobilizing those who yearn for change in the White House, by systematically exposing the tools of the right-wing, and those behind it who are gaining the most.<br />Mr. Franken goes to great length to specifically target the rantings of Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity and discredit their methods. He and his research team bring out fact after fact to bring down the right wing zealots in pieces. <br />Mr. Franken also spends a great deal of time discussing the &quot;liberal media bias&quot; and how it is a product of the biases of the right wing media. Again, facts and revealing quotes from the right and the left contribute to paint a picture that seems far closer to the truth than what one would see on Fox News.<br />The latter half of the book focuses on exposing the lying ways of our current sitting President and the causes he defends the most. In particular, the religious right, the environment, and dodging military service are spotlighted. <br />Through it all, Franken keeps his sense of humor and allows the book to be an easy read. I continue to hope for Al Franken to get more airtime, either through a radio show or a talk show. The American public needs to hear commentary from this man as we gear up to the 2004 elections. His wit and insight shine throughout the book, and I would highly recommend this to anyone genuinely interested to reading about how the right wing media operates and influences Americans, while protecting a President whose primary focus is on advancing the financial interests of a few people. Thanks Al for taking the time to write this.	2003-09-01

I pre-ordered this book months ago! <br />I am a casual listener/reader of many of the folks Al skewers in this book; if even a few of his recountings are accurate as reported, he has written a blistering indictment sure to embarass many high-profile personalities.  Few things are more shaming or credential-busting than lying (one would hope), and Al approaches his foes on the right with the facts (usually their own seemingly inaccurate words, from the record), asks them to address what they've said, and is relentless until they either come clean or are squirming in their seats - and we the readers get the ugly (and funny) recounting.  You'll either feel embarassed for them or be cheering him all the way.  And maybe sometimes both. <br />The first 100+ pages are full of laugh-out-loud writing; I was consistently reading passages to my fiancee.  After that, through the meat of the book, Al is really grinding his axe and the work of his 14 Harvard researchers seems to take over as the laughs are elbowed off the page by more strident political writing (but he did say one of his goals of the book is to keep President Bush from getting re-elected).  As he'll tell you, there are many on the right doing this kind of writing for the GOP, so he no doubt feels the need to ratchet it up a level as the liberal standard-bearer of the moment.  <br />All in all a very good book.  It didn't get five stars from me because, as I said, I sometimes went several pages without laughing, which I consider a long time when reading his work (and it had nothing to do with the politics).  I think that with 90% of readers likely to be left-leaning, most people who pick up the book will love every page.	2003-09-01

I usually disapprove of attempts to discuss important questions through ad hominem attacks, and I assumed from the \\"Lying Liars\\" title that there would be plenty of personal attacks in the book.  But I was curious about the book because I had heard that Harvard University had donated the labor of a dozen research assistants to Mr. Franken so that he could write this book.<BR>It turned out that this was the first partisan Democrat book that I have enjoyed in the past two years.  It is smart, funny, and well-written.  The chapters on Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly are particularly effective.  I now understand why Mr. O'Reilly has been so incensed by the book.  Mr. Franken's evisceration of Mr. O'Reilly's hypocrisy and dishonesty reads like the closing statement of an experienced, eloquent, and passionate courtroom prosecutor.<BR>But while the book is entertaining and thought-provoking, I was ultimately disappointed with Mr. Franken's own problems with matching his version of events with the truth, with reality.<BR>I'll give two examples out of many in the book, one small and one big.  My small example is his phone encounter with Paul Gigot, the editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page.  When Mr. Franken confronts him on the phone, Mr. Gigot naturally responds a little defensively and suspiciously.  Mr. Franken spins this as Mr. Gigot being angry and an \\"unfriendly person\\".  It's funny, but it's untruthful and unfair to Mr. Gigot.<BR>My big example is the whole chapter on the Paul Wellstone public memorial service.  From beginning to end, it is cleverly written as an apologia for what turned out to be a horrible debacle for the Democrats.  As Mr. Franken correctly points out, the negative public reaction to the service probably cost the Democratic Party control of the U.S. Senate.  But according to Mr.Franken it wasn't the Democrats' fault, it was the fault of Rush Limbaugh and other Republican commentatorswho lied about the service and misrepresented it as a political rally.  But by presenting differences of opinions as \\"lies\\", and by being highly selective in his seemingly comprehensive narrative of the circumstances of the memorial service, he is the using the intellectually dishonest methods of his arch-nemesis Bill O'Reilly.<BR>So I would highly recommend this book for entertainment purposes only.  Anyone looking for the truth about the \\"right wing\\" is apt to be seriously misled.	2003-09-01

Someone Telling it Like it Is	I picked up this book a couple of days ago and literally could not put it down. I was beginning to think I was alone in finding the \\"reporting\\" on Fox \\"News\\" (and other right wing outlets) to be wildly innacurate and just plain wrong. Al Franken sets the record straight with a very well researched book that slams Fox, Ann Coulter, and even the mainstream press for making a hack job of what used to be a noble profession.<br />This book is the exact opposite of the books from Coulter, Hannity et al: it's factual, devoid of personal attacks and malicious diatribe, and it is hugely entertaining. No wonder it's number one.<br />Now if only the media would live up to their jobs and:<BR>1) Start reporting well researched NEWs;<BR>2) Start retracting the MASSIVE factual errors they have made over the past several years (examples in Franken's book include the pillaging of the White House when Clinton moved out, the slamming of Al Gore's involvment in the commercialization of the internet, forgetting to mention the still existent Halliburton connection to the Iraq war).<br />I guess the most interesting thing is that while I can find dozens of sources refuting Coulter/Hannity/Limbaugh/Savage on the web, I cannot find a single one showing that Al Franken's data is incorrect. <br />But then that's the difference between facts and propoganda, isn't it?	2003-09-01

Okay, if you are a liberal, you will enjoy this book more than others. Like me, you will laugh along with Franken and nod in agreement with facts and opinions you already know and share. If you are an independent, however, or are unfamiliar with the current political climate, you will probably find yourself gasping aloud as Franken intelligently and wittily tears down one Conservative lie/talking-point after another.<br />And if you are a Conservative--you know you're not going to agree with Franken's opinions. If you're easily rankled--don't bother reading it because you know you're going to get mad--it's not good for the health! :-)<br />Undoubtedly my favorite chapters were &quot;Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One,&quot; &quot;Supply Side Jesus,&quot; and the one on the events leading up to September 11th.

With the neoconservative movement now in effective control of national politics, and nakedly attempting to parlay their power into perpetual rule by misleading and scaring the public, Franken has stepped forward again with _Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right_.  The book, while flawed, is still a boon for those who look to help loosen the stranglehold the far right has on America today.<br />As with the Limbaugh book, in between personal anecdotes and non-political humour, Franken not only pokes fun at conservatives, he shatters their arguments.  Fox News' conservative bias is thoroughly documented, Ann Coulter's \\"research\\" is destroyed, Bill O'Reilly's shameful lies are exposed, and the crimes of the conservative right, from using 09/11 and its aftermath to further their political allies' businesses, to their shameful distortion of Paul Wellstone's funeral to steal the 2002 elections, are all comprehensively and irrefutably laid out.<br />However, the book isn't perfect.  It lacks the lightheartedness of the Limbaugh book, as Franken's desperation over conservatives' continued control of Congress clearly confounds him.  Also, Franken's continued defence of President Clinton's more moderate policies and actions betrays Franken's own moderateness; his claim that Clinton was \\"the greatest president of the 20th century\\" is horribly absurd.<br />The fact that the right has yet to effectively refute Franken's claims points to the effectiveness and veracity of his arguments in _Lies_, however.  Even those who disagree politically with Franken will probably find themselves entertained by his wit.  For these reasons, the book is required reading for anyone interested in current American politics.itics.	2003-08-31

As a kid in the late '60s and early '70s, I could not find a satisfactory definition of \\"right wing\\" or \\"left wing.\\"  Thus, I opted for the tailfeathers.<br />So it has been most of my life.  Not undecided, not middle-of-the-road; merely a thinking, analytical human being who saw truths and lies from both sides.  Both conservatives and liberals made occasional good points, and both had their share of liars and lunatics.<br />As I have grown older and wiser, I have noticed, with increasing frequency, one fact:<br />In the liars and lunatics category, the liberals are way ahead, and gaining distance at an amazing rate.<br />Al Franken is a shining example of this observation.  And, as with so many ultra-liberals, his form of lunacy is defined as paranoid schizophrenia.<br />After reading a Washington Post article (in which the reporter states that, to Franken, \\"To ask whether the establishment press has a liberal bias 'is like asking whether al Qaeda uses too much oil in their hummus.'\\" - a real knee-slapper, that one), I decided to take a look at Franken's book.<br />To ask if Franken's book is as full of liberal bias as the American mainstream media is like asking if there are any Catholics in the Vatican.<br />Franken expresses much seething anger and absolute paranoia because he feels the \\"conservative media\\" is taking over.  Considering the decidedly liberal stance of the vast majority of newspapers, magazines, television stations, television scriptwriters, movie screenwriters and - face it - Hollywood and the entertainmant industry in general, one fails to see why Franken and his ilk are so terrified of Fox Television and a few radio talk show hosts and conservative authors.  Let's be TRULY fair and balanced here: yes, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Neil Boortz, Michael Savage and Ann Coulter exist.  But, in the arena of mass communications in general, they are tremendously outnumbered.  That's not a conservative opinion, it's a clear observation.  So, why such paranoia?  Surely such purveyors of \\"free speech,\\" \\"truth,\\" and \\"fairness\\" as Franken shouldn't fear a minority of public figures who merely offer a viewpoint that conflicts with his own?

However, an exception to this hearsay exclusion rule is a 'statement against interest'.  That is, if a person makes an out of court statement that is against that person's interests, it is deemed trustworthy enough to allow into court.  For wealthy people like Al Franken (and for that matter, Warren Buffet &amp; Bill Gates, Sr.) to advocate for positions against their interests like higher taxes provides a greater credibility to their statements than the those of the hard-right elite that will benefit massively from tax cuts that mainly enrich the already wealthy.  <br />But beyond this inherent credibility, Al Franken employs a hard-working crew of dedicated researchers, dubbed TeamFranken, that carefully check each of the factual assertions and quotes.  The resulting book is an extremely informative and entertaining look at the right-wing pundits, their misleading methods, and the positions they advocate.  As a testament to TeamFranken's strength, Fox News seems to have been unable to muster a colorable defamation suit but instead filed a flimsy trademark infringement assertion that was thrown out of court by a judge who chastised Fox News for 'trying to undermine the First Amendment.'  <br />Franken's book is a collection of personal stories, analysis of right-leaning pundits, policy analysis, and satirical fiction.  Franken clearly advocates for liberal policies, but unlike some other pundits (*Cough*BillO'Reilly*Cough) he does not make misleading statements by claiming to be independent.  He attacks the hypocrisy, inconsistencies, and outright falsehoods that are used to defend right-wing positions  Franken sets forth his liberal positions in a very entertaining manner and those positions are backed by the TeamFranken research.  For anyone that even has minor questions about veracity of Fox News, the right-wing pundits, and the conservative talk radio on the AM dial, this book is a must-read.<br />For those ditto-heads, citizens of the Savage Nation, and Fox News 'fans' (as Fox News itself labels its viewers) that take the right-wing view without any question, I pity you.  A closed mind cannot learn.  Go ahead and start bashing Franken as a 'liberal traitor sissy' now because I'm sure your leaders who you blindly follow will be telling you to do that soon.	2003-08-31

I'm only 100 pages in to the book (I only picked it up today), but I can say without a doubt that it will make my \\"Favorite Books\\" list, if such a list does, in fact, exist.<br />Al Franken writes like Michael Moore, but sharper. Whereas Michael is prone to writing about how he dropped out of college because he couldn't find a parking space (good story, bad focus), Franken stays on target throughout the book. Or at least, throughout the first 100 pages. And that target is the group of conservative liars that have lied, covered up their lies with lies, and lied about covering up their lies.<br />And it's funny, too. It's not sputtering with hate like Ann Coulter's writing. It's researched, as well, which will come to a shock to all of the conservative readers out their used to baseless accusations and wild conspiracy theories of a liberal media.<br />Read the book. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll wish it was longer. And that's why you'll cry. And that's all I have to say.	2003-08-31

Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right is on my list of favorite non-fiction.   The book is very, very funny.  The kind of funny that makes you laugh out loud while you read. Franken tells great stories with honesty and hilarity (even when he's confessing his own moments of poor judgment).    He exposes the lies that bullies Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly (and others) broadcast on television, radio and in their books, and shows how mainstream media outlets further disseminate the lies by neglecting to conduct adequate research.   There's a wonderful chapter on how the right wing distorted the Paul Wellstone memorial--thank you Al.  The great thing about Al Franken is that he's logical, liberal, very funny and he's standing up for what is important in the USA.

What I've found is that the book is at its best when it presents false-statements by right-wing authors.  The book is at its worst when it tries to be funny instead of sticking to the facts.  For example, Al Franken writes that Bill O'Reilly's new book titled &quot;Who's Looking Out for You&quot; is titled &quot;Living with Herpes&quot; (page 65).  <br />I guess Al Franken was trying to be funny by changing the title of O'Reilly's book, but by not sticking with the facts Franken diminishes the whole chapter.<br />Another problem with the book is that some of the quotes could be better referenced.  For examples, on page 38 Franken quotes conservatives, including Bernard Goldberg, as saying the media has a liberal bias, but doesn't give the source of the quotes.<br />The best chapter is chapter 9, which discusses a study which found that while Washington-based journalists are more liberal on social issues than the general public, these journalists are more conservative on economic issues.  The study was conducted in 1998 by Dr. David Croteau of Virginia Commonwealth University.	2003-08-31

He has enlisted a crew of 15 fact checkers from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government to double check every claim he makes in the book, and does he ever take the wind out of the sails of elected, appointed officials, and right wing pundits! Talk about correcting &quot;revisionist history&quot;!   He takes on the shackled press, too. His crew peels off layers of pejudicial myth and right wing folk tales and &quot;reports&quot; found in &quot;news&quot; papers, heard and seen on media.  The blatant dishonesty and hidden agendas stand there bare faced and looking as bad as they are.<br />Personally I reacted  to his profanity and vulgarity very sourly.  It's not just tasteless, it takes away fromthe power of his work and gives emotional sanction to disregard this very serious work, if not to dismiss it all as sophomoric wallowing in nastiness' just because I can.'<br />I think Chapter 29 the &quot;Operation Chicken Hawk&quot; gets all the animous and bile slathered around so completely I begin to feel the purpose is the &quot;slathering&quot;, not to &quot;expose&quot; the personalities presented in the chapter. The crew does very well in that department all through the book, that chapter can be dispensed with.  Chapter 37 &quot;The Gospel of Supply side Jesus&quot; is one of the more biting, hurting satires exposing right wing/GOP mentality I've ever struggled through.<br />Mr. Franken tells us he's working on a book focusing on President Bush intended for release in October, just before elections. I hope he manages to leave out the vulagarity and profanity  so the power of facts, and the clarity of the record can be seen clearly and with power not murked up by nastiness. Let the record and facts speak for themselves. (I understand an &quot;unofficial biography&quot; will come out in the same time frame by another author.)<br />This book is well worth the time to read.

I'm glad this is now a #1 bestseller. It deserves to be. I'd like to believe most Americans already agree with many of the points this book makes, and that there are no revalations here: the lies of the current administration; their toadies in the form of Rupert Murdoch's disgraceful \\"media outlets\\"; their blind arrogance to common sense; cow-towing to the rich and special interest groups; Dick Cheney's utterly disgusting stance of self-interest and secrecy; Ashcroft's backwardness; Sean Hannity's complete idiocy; the collapse of the economy under their watch. Yes, Ann Coulter is whacked out of her mind. Yes, most war hawks (and there sons and daughters) have no idea what being in a war is like. And yes, they all LIE. We all do. Even Al. And he has the guts to admit it. As this book shows, some lies are worse than others, and can  do serious damage to this country, its hard-working citizens, its reputation in the world community, etc. A touching chapter on Al's deceased friend Paul Wellstone is a nice touch. Hopefully reading a book like this will be a step in the right direction: realizing we need a change in Washington, and the way we interpret media of the right-wing variety.

The material on O'Reilly is snarky, the rebuttals of Hannity are devastating.  And this is all well and good.  But what's really remarkable about the book is Franken's deft defense of Clinton's counterterrorism initiatives, and his righteous outrage that (a) the Bush crew ignored the briefings of outgoing National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and even the comprehensive anti-al Qaeda plan of Clinton counterterrorism expert Richard Clarke, whom Condoleezza Rice had asked to stay on after the Supreme Court had installed her boss in the White House, (b) the Bush crew then ignored the national security report of the Hart-Rudman Commission, issued on February 15, 2001, and then, (c) true to form, conservatives blamed 9/11 on Clinton.

Zany, visceral, hilarious, weird as it may be, the book drives home a concrete and valid reality: Americans are being misled by con-artists, political spinsters, and sloppy well-intentioned \\"journalists\\" who tacitly or overtly accept untrue information, and then feed it to casual news watchers.<br />Franken is a comedian, but through the hilarity (and a few flop jokes) is a most serious premise. And it is not so much a polemic rant as his adversaries will claim. In fact, Franken rips his right-wing enemies a new one with the help of a crack team of Harvard research geeks. He employs scholarship and journalistic integrity to discredit a variety of right-wing frauds, including the President.<br />His \\"TeamFranken\\" documents how mainstream media allows right wing fringe press to blow its horn loud enough to be recognized, even when (or especially when) the facts are bogus. This is a central theme of the book. It is an old trick to get a falsity published in headlines, knowing no one reads the retraction (if one is published). Hence, liars abound.<br />Lies sounds rather extreme off the bat, and Franken's willingness to describe persons in a profane manner (the way we really do it) might take a humorless person or a republican aback. But TeamFranken, in fact a machine of credible research, pours a solid foundation for Franken's accusations - a stage for him to cut loose. And why use sugar?<br />Franken is almost shocking in his exploits. He describes not only his charges against his foes, but his interaction with them. Franken confronts the people he discredits (if they will see him). In doing so he is delightfully obnoxious and courageous. His loud, crude bragging is intentional. He is Al Franken, and that has been part of his act forever (\\"And I'm Al Franken\\"). His tactic is honest, and it is one that other scholarly media critics cannot access. He sees that news has become the business of entertainment, and that often the truth is compromised for professional-wrestling-style debates that evoke memories of Morton Downey Jr. He counters. He uses his celebrity status and his comic talents to mix entertainment with brutal reality. He sees the necessity. But, unlike many \\"news\\" outlets, his facts are real and his intentions are on the table.<br />Perhaps the most profound element in this book is Franken's corny idealism. It is not corny, but we have been trained to see it that way, haven't we? By contrast, the deserving targets of TeamFranken seem incredulous when they are exposed. Dirty tricks are just part of the game, Al! Everybody's doing it, right?<br />Wrong. Bill O'Reilly and company will need MLA manuals (in addition to cortisone) from here out.	2003-08-31

I can certainly understand how well meaning, open-minded conservatives may at times become frustrated reading this book since Franken is a proud, unapologetic liberal who definitely has an ideological point of view.  But with that in mind, this book is not the asinine political hackwork that I thought it was supposed to be, and that many in the media who have most likely not read it have portrayed it to be.  It's a well researched book(thanks largely to TeamFranken) and has a decent tone to it.  I would have liked if Franken would have forced himself to refrain from being blatantly partisan in certain instances, since his detractors will undoubtedly point to those instances in an attempt to discredit an otherwise surprisingly insightful and intelligent book.  <br />People are going to attack Franken and the book, along with the nature of political discourse in this country, because Franken is a comedian.  This is a valid concern since Al Franken is just that: a comedian.  But don't blame Franken for doing the job that competent journalists should be doing.  Franken calls the right wingers who have hijacked the discourse in this country exactly what they are: LIARS.  Something most journalists in this country have been frightened of doing or choose not to. <br />I've seen some of the reviews of this book and am frustrated but not surprised to read that some reviewers are dismissing Franken as doing the same thing that the Hannity's and Coulter's do. He's not.  I've mentioned that I wish Franken would have refrained from being blatantly partisan in some cases, but the most partisan page of \\"Lying Liars\\" is not as blatantly partisan or vitriolic as the least partisan and vitriolic page of Coulter's \\"Treason\\" or Hannity's \\"Let Freedom Ring.\\"  <br />Franken gives his take on the right wing media.  He covers everything from institutions like Fox News, The Washington Times, and the Wall Street Journal to individuals like, most notably, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, and Bill O'Reilly.  He goes after the President, Vice President and several other conservatives.  Franken exposes dozens of substantive lies, which I believe in many cases he proves are unarguably deliberate.  This current administration is proven to be just as dishonest as the Clinton administration, but in a much more calculated, mean-spirited way.  The entire book was valuable but the three most indispensable chapters are the chapters on Coulter, Hannity, and O'Reilly.  If you're a rational, fair-minded person then you are most likely disgusted by these three people (O'Reilly not necessarily because of his politics but because of his obnoxious arrogance and self-promotion).  Franken did something amazing.  Something I never thought anyone could do.  He put out the fire inside of me that raged when I heard these three personalities.  After knowing what I now know, I'm not angry at them, I pity them.  In a way, I kind of already knew it, but no one else ever put it in print.  <br />Ann Coulter is proven to be a breathtakingly lazy researcher and psychological case study.  Hannity is proven to be a hopelessly hateful hack whose sophistry knows no limits.  And O'Reilly is proven to be a dishonest obnoxious bully.  He lies about his Peabody's, he lies about his party affiliation, he lies about his background history, he lies about lies in attempts to cover up those lies, he lies about everything.  In one lie, O'Reilly, in his usual phony rage, says that Hillary Clinton did not meet with any of the families of the 9-11 victims.  I, who admire Hillary Clinton, was dissapointed with her when I heard O'Reilly make that claim shortly after 9-11.  As Franken alerts us to, Hillary, at the time O'Reilly made his hurtful claim, had already met with 11 families of victims and had attended the funeral of Father Mike Judge.  O'Reilly never apologized for saying something that was inaccurate and hurtful, he never has. It's not right and it's about time someone had the fortitude to stand upto him.  He sounds so confident on his show and intimidates and shouts down anyone who questions his accuracy although he's frequently wrong.  He's a lying bully.  <br />I think it's possible if not likely that seventeen months from now, when President Dean or President Kerry will have just been sworn in, the person most responsible for it will have been an aging former SNL satirist.  Maybe, just maybe, this book will be successful in forcing liberals to locate their testicles, stand up, and fight.<br />One more thing, Franken has something of mine that most conservatives and many liberals don't have: my trust.  His Limbaugh book was thoroughly accurate and this book is, I have no reason to doubt, just as accurate.  The negative reviews I have seen do not attack his accuracy.  They can't.  If he's inaccurate about anything, I'd love to know.  I, unlike most conservatives, do not admire liars just because they say things I agree with.  Let me be clear, I'm not attacking conservative values, which in most cases, I completely oppose but respect.  What I am attacking is conservatives who don't have a problem with proven malicious liars like Limbaugh simply because he says things they agree with.  I never understood that.  You would think someone would have contempt for an individual who gave them false information that would harm their reputation if they repeated that false information.  You won't have that problem with Franken.  When you hear the negative reviews of this book, ask yourself if Franken's accuracy is being questioned.  Many conservatives, including O'Reilly, have said that Franken is \\"vicious.\\"  Read the book.  He's not.  But the point is no one has yet and most likely will not adequately attack his accuracy, but they will attack him.  <br />One last thing, it's a funny book!  The O'Reilly \\"fellatio\\" passage was worth the price!  Geez Bill!  What were you thinking?	2003-08-31

The book is a pointed look at conservatives. Franken employed over a dozen research assistants mostly from Harvard graduate school to help him with the book. His style is very readable and funny. The book was very eye opening for me- a conservative who has never voted democratic in any election. His attacks on Bill O'Reilly and Fox news are well researched and well done. Some points may seem trivial but the majority are substantive. It was good to see an expose' like this. It was well worth my time to read. It is true that the media cannot be truly objective about anything and Al attacks directly the notion that the media is only &quot;liberal&quot;. Thinking people who want to be challenged and care about the political climate of the country should read this book. You may not agree with everything Al writes, but the points he makes are well researched and worth considering.	2003-08-31

FORCE THIS BOOK ON YOUR FAMILY!<br />Satire or not, Franken's punch lines are hard hitting, well researched and, well, factual (meaning not lies).  It time to open our ears and not just listen to the lies that are being perpetuated, its time to actually hear the truth (or lack there of) and Al Franken makes a fair attempt to present to the reader exactly that, the truth.  I purchased this book last Friday night and just finished this Sunday morning.  It has me hyped and energized and I want to discuss and debate.  Thank you, Al!<br /><br />With the assistance of a Harvard research team of fourteen students, Al dutifully presents sources and notes, footnotes and references to ensure that facts are being presented to the reader.  Do not let Al's reputation as comedian leave you thinking this book is a fluff piece.  It's as serious as you can get when you make accusations against our White House and the conservative media for being the lying liars they are.  Sure, there are laughs, there is parody and satire, but its what makes this bitter pill go down so smooth.<br />Even if you are conservative, a loyal GOP member or just an avid watcher of Fox news, you owe it to yourself to examine the side of the story you haven't been exposed to.  This book will do just that, and in the process you may be able to start asking the hard questions and seek out the truth that isn't being presented by our President, his staff and their loyalists in the mainstream media.  You owe it to yourself!<br />Go to your library or local bookstore and look through the book.  Read pages 132 - 141, Chapter 19, Who Created the Tone?  An easy read in five to ten minutes.

That said, the book is funny.  Some places it's laugh-out-loud funny, and some places it's bitterly funny.  The chapter on &quot;Operation Ignore&quot; is less funny than it is horribly disturbing.  While this book will not convince a dyed-in-the-wool conservative, I don't think it's intended to.  It is intended for you and me, to make politics more palatable with a dose of humor, while maybe nudging us a little more firmly in the direction of the polls, and convincing us that there is a difference between the parties.

I'd laugh, then I'd get angry, and then sad, all within the same chapter.  Honest political discussion has all but disappeared.

Al Franken is a very funny man and there are plenty of laughs in this book.  He reads widely, does his research (or has it done by TeamFranklin) and does a credible job in countering some of the sillier claims of the conservative movement.  He regularly and successfully torpedoes Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter, among others.  He accurately tells the truth about the hatchet job conservatives and the media did on the Wellstone Memorial.  I learned a lot from the book.  (\\"I LAUGHED!  I LEARNED!\\") The irony of the whole \\"fair and balanced\\" controversy is, of course, that Al is no more \\"fair and balanced\\" than FoxTV or, for that matter, Ann Coulter, the subject of two chapters in this book.  (I understand that Al is deliberately being ironic).  But therein lies the problem with this interesting and enjoyable read.  As a regular reader, I believe it is time for Al to decide whether he is going to be a more effective political commentator or a comedian of this style.  It is, of course, possible to be a funny AND a legitimate political commentator (Molly Ivins, P.J. O'Rourke).  I think the problem here is that Franken's style of humor, carried to extremes, blunts his arguments.  He slides from truth-telling to satire and back again.  A reasonably intelligent reader can tell the difference.  But, his hatred for the principals of the political movement he despises and his willingness to engage in personal attacks make him share more with Ann Coulter than I imagine he wants to admit.  There is plenty of room for satire of Franken's style.  There is plenty of room for hard-nosed and objective commentary.  In Franken's case the blend of the two often works--but the meanest and most personal of his attack-humor gives his critics a good excuse to wave him off as \\"shrill and unstable.\\"  What we need, and still don't have, is dispassionate analysis of the current polarization of American politics that can help us all form a clearer picture of what is going on in American political life.sionate analysis of the current polarization of American politics that can help us all form a clearer picture of what is going on in American political life.	2003-08-30

The judge hearing the case thought so as well, dismissing it immediately with prejudice.<br />This was not one of Fox's shrewder moves.  Franken is not a low seller to begin with, but with this free rocket blast of publicity his book jumped to Number One on the Amazon.com list before it was even available for shipping.<br />Franken begins his shrewd and humorous tome by embellshing upon an incident many of us saw nationally televised on C-Span 2, a joint appearance of Franken's along with fellow liberal humorist and author Molly Ivins and his arch nemesis Bill O'Reilly of Fox fame at the Booksellers Convention in Anaheim, California.    When Franken began explaining how O'Reilly had insisted he had won a prestigious Peabody Award while hosting Inside Edition, former Saturday Night Live writer Franken demonstrated conclusively that this was not so.  O'Reilly became so apoplectic that, as Franken notes, he wondered if violence would ensue.  In his book he expunges O'Reilly's claim of being an independent voter by producing a copy of the commentator's voting application in New York State, which reveals him clearly to be a registered Republican.<br />While keeping the jokes hot and heavy, Franken, in the manner of British writers such as Alexander Pope, uses humor to prove critical points.  In this effort he is assisted by Team Franken, a group of bright Harvard University graduate students who assisted him in the important research department.<br />Fox had reason to be unhappy with Franken for more than his material dealing with O'Reilly.  He takes on Sean Hannity as well, exploding his contentions about Clinton on military preparedness opposite Ronald Reagan, and concerning his claims that liberals have not achieved prosperity, pointing to Clinton's admirable job creation record.He also pokes fun at a ploy he thinks reflects Fox News head Roger Ailes's cynical sense of humor, adding passively likeable moderate Allan Colmes as a quiet foil for Hannity, billing their joint meetings in a liberal vs. conservative context.<br />Franken supplies a hilarious chapter that appears to be straight out of his Saturday Night Live days about the Chicken Hawks at war, led by George W. Bush with Bill O'Reilly, Phil Gramm, Bill Bennett and Dick Cheney supplying additional muscle.  <br />If you like good humor and satire, along with well researched documentation trapping television and radio purveyors of error, this is a book for you to read and enjoy.	2003-08-30

This is an extraodinary book, researched by a team of Harvard kids, written with great wit and passion.  It would be a mistake to confuse Franken's work with a humor book. It is much better, much more comprehensive -- and more important than that. In fact it is a devastating, irrefutable attack on the cadre of elite right wing propagandists who have hijacked our national debate (and our newsmedia.)  Franken exposes this pack of vampires and  racists to the harsh light of day -- and the effect is extraordinary.  Guaranteed, you will never, ever listen to the regurgitations of RNC blast faxes by the likes of O'Reilly, Coulter, Bozell, Gigot, the hate filled NY Post; Joe Scarborough, Will et al in the same way again.  Franken hilariously skewers pitiful little Alan Colmes (whose name he will only write in the lower case) as a prop in Roger Ailes's propaganda machine (the nerdy little moderate who can barely get out a coherent sentence out) -- and he does so with facts and righteous and cheerful humor.<br />The other day I was in New York, near 72nd street.  A sign outside Gray's Papaya said: THANK YOU, AL FRANKEN.  LET'S GET RID OF THESE CREEPS!  I was braced by the appearance of this sign.  It's coming, fellas.  This country has experienced evil and corrupt periods before -- we purged ourselves of slavery.  We stood up against the sexual hypocrisies and evil at the Salem witch trials.  We stood up against corrupt and wicked leaders like Jefferson Davis and Nixon and Harding and Hoover.  Ours is a strong country -- we can end this wicked era. And Franken's book, like Uncle Tom's Cabin before (I'm not kidding, it's that important) like the wicked satires of Swift and Dickens and Twain -- who exposed the wicked hypocrites and evildoers of their era) may be a crucial blow.<br />Read Franken's wonderful book -- and if you're in New York, have one of the wonderful hotdogs at Gray's Papaya!

He also clues us in on how a handful of people can control and shape public opinion, with no regard for reality or truth.  A thoroughly informative and enjoyable read.

This book is the new addition to my lending library--only three other books have such an honor of multiple copies.<BR> <BR>I just laughed and laughed and laughed. <br />And at this point, I have read it all nearly three times. This book has infinitely more depth than any humorous book I have ever read before. Frankly it has more depth than most college textbooks. So even though there are lots of jokes and most of the jokes are screamers, in a lot of ways, the book is extremely extremely serious. But that's OK; I'm a serious enough guy. But it's packed with things that I didn't know. [With six college degrees, it's not really normal for me to have to admit that.] And it's a bit of a brainy book in some parts. The people who did at least some of the research and the fact checking on the book were 14 Harvard students [many being grad students], who competed to be chosen out of the 700 Harvard students who signed up to do the seminar course with Franken. So imagine that you are a humorist, and you now have 14 utter geniuses as your work slaves. It makes for a different kind of book. I recommend it highly. <br />One thing that some people who were criticised by the book (or whose heros were criticised) didn't like is that Al does not back down one bit from those who regularly go out of their way to lie and intimidate. They call a name.  He calls one right back.  [Seems pretty fair given that Al backs his claims up.] But we all knew that. And in my opinion, Al doesn't do that to anyone who doesn't do it to others all the time and who also richly deserves it.  For example, Rush Limbaugh used to constantly ridicule Janet Reno on her personal appearance, or Chelsea Clinton on her personal appearance. [This must be because Rush is such a good looking man you know.] Then Al wrote a book called \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Liar.\\" You'll remember how many of Rush's friends whined about how Big Bad Al was picking on poor little rush. Here \\"Lies and the Lying Liars that Tell Them\\" is much the same. Bill O'Reilly, known for yelling down people rather than reasoning, pretty much got his ass kicked at the Book Expo America--Al directly confronting O'Reilly with lies O'Reilly had told about winning journalism awards and then catching O'Reilly lying about it some more. Bad form, lying about jounalism awards. Easy to check too. O'Reilly couldn't stop him as it wasn't O'Reilly's show even though O'Reilly tried. [The complete story which in the book is much much funnier.] And then there is Ann Coulter who apparently thinks that Senator Joe McCarthy is a wonderful role model, and with him as her spirit guide, calls well over half of the country \\"Traitors\\". There are a number of others as well.  But you get the idea.  The book \\"Lies and the Lying Liars that Tell Them\\" is exactly what it says it is. It exposes the methods of lying used by various of the country's right-wing-nut media. And then it makes fun of them. Some of it is hillarious. Some of it is disheartening. But almost all of it was enlightening. <br />My favorite silly part is still Operation Chicken Hawk. My favorite serious part was how Ann Coulter uses six distinctly different methods to lie using footnotes. <br />My favorite satirical expose was the sending of letters to expose the hypocracy of 27 of the most powerful people in the country who espouse \\"Abstinence Education\\" [by which they mean no real sex education at all other than, \\"Just say No.\\"] Is it a surprize that none of the 27 came up with an \\"abstinence story\\" for \\"Saving It!\\", the obviously pretend publication for high schools. Ha Ha Ha.  Can you imagine funny little Al doing this. God, I bet the 27 were mad. Imagine. You are one of the most powerful people in the country, and you have just gotten a letter from little Al Franken making fun of you, asking you to prove that you have \\"walked the walk\\".  Worse, you know it is going to be printed in Al's new book, \\"Lies and theLying Liars Who Tell Them.\\" Even worse, you don't have a single thing you can say to defend yourself from the implicit charge of hypocracy because you are a hypocrite. Worse still, the letter is howlingly funny. People will be laughing at you.  You are very very argry.  Well Al did wind up having to send an apology for using Harvard letterhead to send the letter out to the 27. [It seems that Harvard Fellows like Al don't have that right to use Harvard letterhead just because they are teaching a class--I did not know that.] And these 27 did get revenge on Al to that extent.

However, his book isn't a whining liberal's bitter attack on The Right, rather it is a thoughtful and well mapped out discourse on the tired journalistic tricks and deceitful practices of media neo-cons. His examples are clearly stated, backed up with facts and rebutted in such a hilarious way that the book never left my hands from the time I opened to page 1.<BR>   The examples Franken uses show the \\"facts\\" as presented by conservative writers/journalists/TV personalities. He picks them apart with such precision you'd almost expect to see such titles as Slander (Coulter), Let Freedom Ring, (Hannity), Bias (Goldberg) in the FICTION section. <BR>   He sites various examples of how the current administraion leads the public to believe their intentions are honorable when their motives are precisely 180 degrees the opposite. The enviroment, education, taxes, terroism, the military, etc. are all taken to task. I actually couldn't believe some of the things I was reading so I took to verifying them myself. UNBELIEVEABLE! His explanations of the effects of Bush's policies are specific and worrisome (and should be punishable). What's more, because these LIES of the Bush administration are not daily fodder for mainstream (or cable) news, it illustrates just how ludicrous it is to suggest the media is slanted to the left (The chapter on Terrorism really blew my mind. This should be MUST READING for every voter in the 2004 election). <BR>I was shocked and dissapponted at what I \\"believed\\" happen in Minnesota during the memorial to Paul Wellstone. The reports from even CNN and MSNBC had me convinced that this was a charade which backfired for the DNC. Franken, a native of Minnesota, recounts the \\"actual\\" event, how the right wing media distorted it and even fabricated untruths about it. He then explores the process of how the mainstream media begins to echo these distortions, enabling the public to be mislead (especially yours truly).<BR>   Franken is eloquent to be sure. He is funny(tm). He is genuinely [angry] and honest. His facts are not buried at the back of the book or aimed to be misleading. His style is such that I felt less like I was reading and more like I was eating tiramisu (I love tiramisu).<BR>   One among many of the liberal 'call to arms', this one is a must for any voter or seeker of the \\"truth\\".	2003-08-30

I came across this book at B&amp;N last night, picked it up, and after reading the first paragraph, couldn't put it down.  I bought it and read most of it before the evening was out. This book's primary focus is anti-conservative as Al Franken shreds any and all conservative views and actions of the present to the Reagan era.  Luckily, he is also frank, methodical, and concerned about the truth (or lack thereof) as he methodically exposes lies and half-truths of such conservative noteworthies as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel, about Reagan's &quot;zupply-zide zeconomics,&quot; about the failures of Bush Sr. to respond appropriately to terror attacks, and other conservative failures.  As important as exposing some of the lies of the conservatives is (some of which is frankly vain), for me the humor and satire employed by Franken to drive the point home is the real gem of the book.  At times I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.... !	2003-08-30

Insight	If you're a Liberal who fizzles with frustration at the mere mention of Sean Hannity or Ann Coulter; a Conservative who still thinks that the Bush administration is a bit out of control; or anyone else who wants a refreshing perspective on politics, you should read this book. Al Franken's overwhelming, laugh-out loud dissection of every leader of the modern American Right had me hooked from the first page. He says everything that I (as an admitted Liberal) have desperately wanted to say to Coulter, Hannity, Cheney, Ashcroft and Bush. What's more, he distinguishes himself from right-wing political pundits by being genuinely and happily funny (as opposed to the upsetting, bitter humor of books like Bernard Goldberg's &quot;Bias&quot;--also dissected) and surprisingly informative (thanks to a team of Harvard researchers who helped him out). This is no mere attack on the right--it is a careful, conscientious refutation, and manages to be both intelligent AND readable (I finished all 350 pages in a day and a half). Die-hard Conservatives will undoubtedly slam Franken for occasionally indulging in their own brand of more mean-spirited laugh-getting (he and Bill O'Reilly just don't get along), but the icing on &quot;Lies&quot;'s cake is Al's refreshing willingness to admit when he's gone too far--as when he reflects on the lessons learned after posing as the father of a prospective student to the infamous Bob Jones University. (Other great moments include an ironic &quot;Supply-side Jesus&quot; comic and a perfectly vindicating explanation of how Liberals really DO love America.) If there is any book in this politically charged time that will both reassure left-wingers and plant the seeds of doubt in the minds of a few of our more right-leaning friends, &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot; is it.	2003-08-30

When I bought this book I actually thought it would have a liberal bias and 'Fair and Balanced' was just a FOX News pun, i was wrong. Though he did make some partisan remarks, the book was all about the right-wing pundits and media's lies, and how there is no such thing as a liberal media (unless your talking alternative media.) Now, I dislike Democrats as much as I dislike Republicans. I am a liberal and I vote Green (and in the CA Recall I'm casting my vote for Arianna Huffington,) but this book is a lot better and a hell of a lot funnier than Stupid White Men which was my favorite book till this came out. In this book he shows how Ann Coulter lies in her book (and a section called 'How to Lie with Footnotes') and how she is a hypocrite, how Bill O'Rilley, Hannity and his Centrist Punching Bag Colmes Show, Bush, Rove and so many other right wingers lie and explains how they lie and gives examples.

This book is also a hell of alot better than 'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot: And Other Observations' and most definitely \\"I'm Good Enough...\\" And he is willing to read right-wing propaganda for us and pick out some lies so we don't have to (though everyday I listen to Rush Limbaugh and prove him wrong to my co-worker who loves him and how is starting to think he is a liar now because of it.)

It expounds not only on the dirty tactics of the Right but also on the foibles of their leading luminaries - Bush, Cheney, Rove and Ashcroft. Not spared are media pundits such as O'Reilly, Rush, Coulter and Hannity. Franken tells tales on himself about some of his own  far-out responses to the Right's way-out actions.

Once again he has targeted the collective soft underbelly of the Right Wing Wackos--their inability to tell the truth. Armed with little more than a razor-sharp wit, a LexisNexis account, and TeamFranken (his secret weapon), Franken exposes one RRW lie after another. He shows that Bill O'Reilly not only has trouble telling the truth, but goes postal when anyone dares to point out one of his lies; he makes a pretty good case for Ann Coulter being a genuine nutcase (but most people figured that out long ago anyway); he destroys many of the lies that RRWs have told for years about President Clinton and Vice President Gore; he exposes the cowardliness of the mainstream press for not calling the RRWs on their lies; and he does all of this using something RRWs have a bit of trouble with---FACTS.<br />My one complaint is that Franken has made be question my view of the President-select. I've always thought that Shrub Jr. was more of a puppet than a leader. I sort of figured that all of the mean-spirited lies and other assorted BS that comes out of the Shrub Jr. Whitehouse was something condoned, but not necessarily instigated by that great Ace of the Texas Air National Guard. In fact I figued that Shrub Jr. was just pretty much just a paper mache-headed marionette, controlled by the RRW power-elite. However, Franken paints a picture of Shrub Jr. as more of a puppeteer---using the likes of Rumsfeld, Norton, and Rove to do all of the dirty-work of lying, distorting, etc., and then blaming them if things get sticky. Now I'm not sure if Shrub Jr. is more of lying liar (and a mean-spirited one at that), or a bumbling bozo.<br />Just remember, Al, a lot of people died in Texas while Shrub Jr. was Governor, some under very mysterious circumstances. In fact, Shrub Jr. signed the of death warrants of more than a few of them. So watch you back. Oh, and if Shrub Jr. askes you to do an extended USO tour of Camp X-ray, tell him that you have other priorities.	2003-08-29

He leaves no stone unturned, from the myth that the mainstream media is liberal, and the recently popular right wing media - given to us via Rupert Murdoch, a multi billionaire who owns over 130 newspapers in the country, Fox Broadcasting, and satellite TV rights the world over.<br />He then exposes several popular conservative writers and TV personalities and exposes them for the habitual liars and political propogandists that they are.  He provides several specific examples, including Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and Rush Limbaugh among others.  The book was obviously very well researched, and is very thorough in showing the reader each example and how it has been twisted.  <br />Franken does not stop his work there, however.  He continues by citing statistical data provided by several different sources, and how conservatives, specifically the Republican Party, use this data to twist the truth to whatever sounds good to them.  A review of the Bush Administration, and how it has affected America is offered, and the reader can see, case by case, exactly what has been done, and who has lied about it.  <br />Franken also makes a point that he accepts challenges from conservative thinkers.  Even Bill O'Reilly, whom he mocks as Bill O'Lie-lly, has been the victim of Franken's superior debating skills.  After proving Bill wrong on the O'Reilly Factor, which is documented in the book, Bill had a bone to pick with Franken.  Then, as the book was nearing publication, the authors, Molly Ivins, Bill O'Reilly, and Franken were invited to be filmed by C-Span to discuss their upcoming books.  Franken took advantage of the situation, and called Bill on several points, documented in the book, of where he has caught Bill intentionally lying.  It ended up as quite a scene, with Bill yelling at Franken to shut up.  Bill kept cutting him off later into theprogram, and the moderator had to stop the discourse.  It showed exactly how vulnerable O'Reilly was outside of his show, where he cannot moderate, cut off, or bully his guests at will.  In the endnotes, Franken provides a link to the entire show, where anyone can see it.  <br />Peronally, this book meant a lot to me.  I consider myself a moderate, and I am registered Republican.  However... I have become passionately disenchanted with the hard-core conservatives.  People like Sean Hannity, and his book \\"Let Freedom Ring,\\" and Ann Coulter, \\"Treason, etc.\\" have done nothing but spew filth.  Reading their books, I discovered just how rabid each can be.  I also read some very ridiculous \\"facts\\" in their books.  I won't go into details, as this is getting lengthy, and Franken does an excellent job of covering this in his book.  <br />My only wish about this book was that he went into even more examples of how popular conservative entities have deliberately lied and misled Americans.  As it stands, what he does unearth about them is damning from a moral and ethical standpoint.	2003-08-29

About as balanced as Fox news.  Is he funny? Yes!  Do his targets richly deserve his combination of angry satire and factual refutation of some of their more outragous spin?  Absolutely! After being spammed on e-mail with columns by Ann &quot;anyone who disagrees with the John Birch society is a traitor&quot; Coulter and some of the more ludicrous conservative &quot;urban legends,&quot; after trying repeatedly to explain to people that Al Gore did NOT claim to invent the Internet or to have discovered Love Canal, or that he was telling the truth when he said that he was one of the models for the character of Oliver in &quot;Love Story,&quot; only to have them flatly refuse to believe it even when they see the correct quotes in context, I was ready to read a book like this.  The sad part is that the people who need to see him dissect those dishonest &quot;arguments&quot; and character assassinations won't have the attention span to make their way through even a single chapter of this book.  But for those of us who have had to listen to conservatives openly gloating that 9/11 was a &quot;cataclysm&quot; for liberalism, and that no patriotic American could possibly disagree with a president who looks good in a flight suit, it's a great morale booster.	2003-08-29

Cons Lie.<br />At least that's the landscape of political discourse in America today. Al Franken is unabshedly partisan, and many will not agree with everything he said. But he has done one things that the FOX News (Wholly Without Merit(tm)) crowd have not done- cite actual facts. Case in point: Ann Coulter, in support of her &quot;liberal snobbery&quot; thesis, claimed that NY Times waited for two whole days before reporting on Dale Earnhart's death. Except that's a lie. A simple due diligence on Franken's part (something that you can do, go to your local university library and check out LexisNexus) shows that NY times featured Dale Earnhart on the front page the very next day. These are not small, inconsequential lies, they undercut the very argument Coulter tries to make in the first place. Or Bill O'Reilly's documented claim that he's an 'independent'- Franken reproduces O'Reilly's 1994 voting registry where the box 'Republican' was clearly checked. Fair and Bogus indeed.<br />Oh, and having FOX News laughed out of court was not a bad bonus either.	2003-08-29

I listen to Bush's shallow, bellicose speeches. I listen to Rush's bombastic arrogance (usually just to keep me alert when I'm driving--I can't be that angry and fall asleep). I listen to the conservative vs. liberal shouting matches on the news channels. I just want to scream at how common and transparent the right-wing lying has become, and worse, at how many Americans seem so lacking in critical listening and thinking skills that they allow themselves to BELIEVE the lies. It's just plain depressing.<br />If you've ever felt the same, grab a copy of Franken's new book and let him articulate your screams for you. Just as he did in \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" (no lie there), Franken serves the reasoning though irate reader as a therapist, letting him/her know that there IS a public voice lashing out against the callous, stupid, greedy, self-serving lies that have become the standard for most conservative politicians and their pundits.<br />But, then, Franken doesn't really lash out. With remarkable calm and that cool, ironic wit, he leads the reader through the overgrown jungle of lies that has become the conservative playground. His machete is crafted of solid documentation, impeccable reason, and personal experience with many of the greatest liars out there. He's also backed up here by \\"TeamFranken,\\" a brilliant group of 14 undergrads and graduate students at Harvard who did a great deal of the research and fact-checking for the book.<br />For those who know Franken only from his comedy career (Saturday Night Live, et al) it may be a surprise to learn of his close ties to the upper echelons of American politics and the media. Those ties often allow him close-up, incisive observations of his subjects; this is not mere humorous commentary from afar. He is feared and loathed by Republicans and their ilk in the highest places, and he pulls no punches in naming names and detailing personal confrontations he's had by phone and on the social scene. And while mostof the book brings regular doses of Franken's humor to both amplify and cushion his dead-serious topics, there are sections that brought me close to tears--let's just say that \\"compassionate conservative\\" is one of the biggest, boldist, most cynical lies of all.<br />Al Franken is one of America's greatest weapons in the fight for truth and reason. Don't allow yourself and your loved ones to be further manipulated by a shamefully biased media--Franken definitively points out the direction of that bias--and those conservatives who are pathological liars. (I must believe there are some who are just dumb or who choose not to think.)<br />Buy this book, read it, dog-ear the best pages, read them again, memorize them, then slap a label on the cover saying \\"Pass it on,\\" leave the book in a waiting room, on a bus, anywhere that another American may pick it up and discover some basic truths about our country and the liars who mangle those truths. With enough readers, this book could end up being the eviction notice to the Bush who almost won that last election.	2003-08-29

It breaks new ground in many ways.  However, I was very apprehensive about it when I first saw its cover and recalled the cheapshot tactics of its author.  Al Franken's \\"style\\" involves constantly making absurd, not-to-be-taken-literally statements.  As an academically-inclined liberal (with two university degrees in Computer Science), and an Orwellian obsession with behaving fairly, I've been disgusted with his previous efforts, such as the book titled, \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and other observations\\", which is full of personal attacks.  However, this book is a BIG change from that style.  It still has flippant statements throughout, and a lot of ad hominem attacks, but around 80 percent less often.  Much of this book (I would say around 70%) is serious, well-researched, cogently-argued writing, with frequent use of super-clear and valid reasoning.  And I was VERY gratified to discover that Franken used a team of research assistants when fact-checking this book's hundreds of amazing claims.  The group-photo of \\"TeamFranken\\" in the back is hilarious (a team of Harvard University students)... <BR>I was extremely pleased to see the attention he gave to exposing the many lies of author Ann Coulter.  Coulter's books are saturated with lies!  I've been shocked by her gall.  Franken thoroughy smashes a few of her worst ones. E.g., on one page he reproduces an image of a New York Times front page, enabling the reader to clearly see that the NYT ran a story about a famous race car driver's death the very next day after he died, and not two days later as Coulter falsely claimed to her readers in her book \\"Slander\\"...Franken's book will hopefully explode her deceptions like a torpedo against a pirate ship...<BR>  I also love Franken's nerve -- how he courageously puts his head into the mouth of the Coulter libel-lion.  E.g. in his chapter about her he reproduces a long list of Coulter's claims about liberals supposedly hating America. Franken later shows a photo of himself arm-in-arm with John Glenn while entertaining US troops abroad. The caption jokingly describes the troop-support work as his way of expressing his \\"hate\\" for America! (Franken loves this nation passionately -- I think that should be obvious to everyone.)<BR>  The biggest defect of this book, for me, is the ambiguity of the intent of many of the false, \\"flippant\\" statements.  At least 90 percent of these statements are obvious to me as being intended to be taken as mere-jokes...but there are so many of them that I've been helplessly puzzled about. \\"How does Franken intend me to take this statement?\\" has been the frequent nagging thought. It's been difficult for me to avoid feeling suspicious...feeling that some of these statements are lies by Franken that he will confess to *only* if exposed as false, thereby using \\"I was only kidding\\" as an escape route to avoid taking responsibility.	2003-08-29

The writer/producer/performer from Satuday Night Live has assembled \\"TeamFranken\\", a group of students from Harvard, to help him gather the research for his book, a method that he recommends Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter try someday, as well as something called \\"publishing the TRUTH.\\"<br />Dispelling malicious lie after malicious lie, Franken parces and demystifies the entire world of smoke and mirrors both in media and politics used to further Republican, Right Wing agendas.  All this is done, of course, with his usual acerbic wit and candor.  Franken, as a comedian, seems never to be taken seriously until it is too late by the folks he talks to.  And when he publicly catches them in some staggering untruth, they resort to (as is the case with Fox's recent lawsuit) legal action, verbal hostility (Bill O'Reilly of \\"The Factor\\") or more lies (Ann Coulter.)<br />But there is more to Franken's book than simply calling conservative commentators to account for their distortions and misrepresentations.  There is also an underlying sense of real concern over the direction America is taking, both foreign and domestic.  To, as the conservatives did, opportunistically and callously court political favor over the public memorial for Senator Paul Wellstone and those who died with him in his plane crash in 2002 is reprehensible, and Franken's depiction of the events of those two weeks underscore his real anger.  <br />But nothing tops his feelings about Ann Coulter, which are, shall we say, extremely passionate.<br />Except maybe \\"Operation Chickenhawk; Episode 1\\" in which notorious hawks George W. Bush, Rush Limbaugh, Dick Cheney, George Will, Clarence Thomas, Newt Gingrich, Pat Buchanan, and Bill O'Reilly (all of whom somehow \\"missed out\\" on combat in Vietnam, yet are perfectly willing to send troops out now,) are put to the ultimate test: being commanded on a Swift by John Kerry.<br />A joy to read.

First, as the title itself indicates, he can do broad humor with the best of them; his jabs are the literary equivalent of good slapstick.  Second, he sprinkles throughout an outstanding brand of subtle deadpan humor, saying things with such a straight face that the humor may be going over some of his readers' heads.  Third, when he gets down to the serious business of the book -- refuting false statements that have become accepted wisdom among conservatives simply because conservatives keep repeating those statements to each other over the airwaves -- he writes with precision and accuracy.  Most particularly, he succeeds not only in refuting the notion that Clinton was to blame for 9/11, he actually makes a sober, well-documented case that Clinton was practically obsessed with terrorism, Al Queda, and Osama, while the Bushies in their first eight months were asleep at the switch, focusing on missile defense and putting the anti-terrorism proposals left behind by the Clintonians on the back-burner.  The humor (of both types one and two) is of course what makes Franken Franken, but I fear that it may undercut how well the third, and deadly serious aspect of the book, will do in correcting some common misconceptions.  However, since the humor is so good, it's hard to question too much what Franken has done here.  In short, this book is a must read for anyone who wants to stop the far right from getting away with more lies.	2003-08-29

He delivers again with Lies...  This book will make you laugh and it will probably make you angry, weather you are conservative or liberal.  For conservatives, you'll be angry for obvious reasons because you can't stand to have your leaders criticzed and you can't stand to be bothered with facts.  If you're a liberal, you'll be angry about all the ways conservatives have distorted the news you hear in today's &quot;liberal media&quot;.  (The story Franken tells about Paul Wellstone's Memorial last year really got to me.  I already thought conservatives were dastardly, but I never expected them to be that disgusting and opportunistic.)  <br />I fully recommend this book to anyone interested in politics, or just interested in a good read.  Hopefully some people will read it and see the light about what the Bush Administration has really been pulling for the last 3 years.  And hopefully, as Mr. Franken says, it will help get Bush out of the White House.	2003-08-29

Finally liberals have a champion wordsmith to voice the mounting frustration built from the pile of distortions and outright lies of radical Republicans gone amok. Franken has taken great pains to carefully document his source material for each claim and counterclaim. His intent is solid. Let's get the facts straight. Shine some light into the murky, slimy darkness of hate media.<BR>It is telling that opponents are unable to dispute a single fact in the book. Attacks on the book drop to the lowest form of character assasination. The volume of screaming coming from his targets demonstrates how precisely he has truly hit them where it hurts. <BR>This is a must read for the Liberal Democrats everywhere. It might just begin to stiffen their backbones for the coming political season. Way to go Al!	2003-08-29

What makes this book great is not the fact that he takes on the conservtives.  It is because he is a great storyteller.  I should say true storyteller, just to make sure that the conservatives who read this review don't say that this book is a bunch of ficticious stories.  The places that Franken has been (Correspondents' dinners, planes with ex-first ladies, even Bob Jones University) make perfect settings for hilarious and insightful yarns.  Yes, not everything in the book is true, but Franken readily admits that he is telling jokes, and it is obvious throughout the book where the fake stuff is and the real stuff is. (Although I actually thought that Bill O'reilly's Book was going to be called Living with Herpes!)  The most telling thing about the book is the utter silence from Ann Coulter, Hannity (and, in a lower case font Colmes), and O'Reilly, who is a writer of some very steamy and erotic prose (read the book and laugh your head off).  These three \\"pundits\\" son't have anything to contradict what Franken has said in the book.  They have nothing to say because Franken tells the truth, while the other three LIE.	2003-08-29

This is often not through a direct call to action, but simply by revealing the injustices in our society in a way that makes the reader feel that they must be remedied.  This is one of those books.  <br />Al Franken, along with a team of students from Harvard who verify every fact and example he gives (there is very little ambiguity in his points and examples and they are all well documented), lays down two major premises in the book: firstly, how there is no \\"big liberal conspiracy\\" in the media; and secondly, how conservatives lie time and again to further their political agenda, at the expense of the welfare of the American people.<br />This book will agitate all who read it: liberals will feel a sense of responsibility to be proactive, as well and a sense of validation of their beliefs after being so harshly criticized by conservatives for so long.  Conservatives may dismiss the entire book as liberal exaggeration, or ironically, lying.  Hopefully, some conservatives will begin to understand and accept some liberal viewpoints, and also understand how they have been lied to for so long by the GOP.  Instead of concentrating his attack on conservatism in general, Franken decries the deception and hypocrisy of its leaders and the right-wing media, which are hurting Americans, as well as people throughout the world.	2003-08-29

With his keyboard dipped in vitriol, Al Franken hilariously exposes the myth of the liberal media while giving several right-wing clowns enough rope to hang themselves along the way. Unlike all too many members of the vanguard right, who have consistently used spurious statistics or outright lies to make their case, Franken simply allows them to choke on their own deceiving words. And choke they do, from &quot;fiction&quot; author Ann Coulter and Fox News' Sean Hannity to the near psychotic rantings of Bill O'Reilly. In fact, Franken's best stuff is saved for O'Reilly, who, when challenged, acts with all the grace of a rat trapped in a corner and confirms our suspicions about the splotchy parody of himself he has become. Especially illuminating is Franken's well-documented history of America's War on Terrorism-a history that, not surprisingly, bears absolutely no resemblance to the Bush White House version.<BR>Conservatives won't get it, of course, (then again, conservatives won't even read it) but Franken is a highly educated, highly articulate, and extremely funny beacon of hope for the left and a true patriot.<BR>As scathingly funny as &quot;Lies. . .&quot; is, Franken reveals the deeply disturbing backslide our country has taken since the neocons took over.

First, commensurate, with Franken's skills as a `hilarious corporate speaker' and Saturday Night Live Vet, it is very very funny, which cannot be claimed of the ever increasing number of screeds from either end of the political spectrum.  Second, it is dead on accurate in calling out the way the right has publicly told lie upon lie and the media has either willfully or lazily fallen for it, the biggest being the repeated lie about how liberal the media is.  This is an important function when such lying bullies as Anne Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity trot out the talking points, distorted facts, or plain wrong statistics to muddy the public discourse.  <br />Example after example of easily caught distortions are brought up--I loved his retelling of the incident with Bernard Goldberg where he nailed him about the late John Chancellor's commentary on the Soviet Union after the failed coup.  <br />Particularly important and, frankly, appalling in its implications, is Franken's discussion of the media coverage surrounding Paul Wellstone's memorial service of last year. Key point:  HE WAS ACTUALLY THERE!  In contrast, many notable personalities of the conservative punditocracy lined up to condemn the memorial without having seen more, at most, than the 20 second clips on TV. Franken makes it clear that brief and spontaneous flurries of emotionally driven partisanship were shamelessly exploited by the right to help boost the Republican majority in congress.  That really disgusts me.<br />Repeatedly, Franken nails the celebreties of the right by confronting them with what they said vs. the facts, and repeatedly I came away laughing. His description of interactions with Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Karl Rove, Bill Bennett, and Barbara Bush are, in particular, very, very funny. <br />Franken is a national treasure, a Puck of the left unafraid to <BR>attack the right by confronting them with their own material and he left this readers laughing, which made it much easier to take the accompanying anger and sadness over the way the right has hijacked public discourse in this country.  <br />He also provides a role model for how we on the left can begin to reclaim our place in the political realm of the USA while being fierce, but not shrill, and maintaining both our integrity and sense of humor. <br />Bravo, Al, and TeamFranken!	2003-08-28

He enters into the world he is criticizing, but only to offer in-kind ripostes to the right-wing pseudo-intellectuals who dominate the popular talkshow/pundit circuit. He cuts through the bilgewater and pomposity to expose what I already knew: O'Reilly and Coulter, et al are a bunch of obnoxious phonies. <br />In order to do so, he simply uses the very words of the rabid right authors and commentators to condemn them. He follows up on their misstatements and evasions and offers a load of evidence for what we all knew already: there is an agenda behind the NEWS that can be traced back to who pays for it. In O'Reilly's case, he proves that &quot;fair and balanced&quot; may be copyrighted, but that the words mean nothing when there is nothing behind them.<br />I picked the book up to leaf through and wound up buying it. I expected a Michael Moore attack piece, but found a book that, although funny, speaks to the need for truth and accountability in the world of garbage factoids. I came away admiring Franken when I had always found him annoying and unfunny as a comedian.  Here Franken uses humor as a secret weapon.

I just finished Lies yesterday, and seeing as how I have the attention span of a gnat, it's a real testament to the book's readability that I finished it in under 4 days.<br />As I'm sure you know, Lies attempts to dispel the myth of a liberal media once and for all.  In fact, the book's ambition goes well beyond that and tries to show how whereas the mainstream media (nightly news on the major networks and so forth) is fairly centrist (although lazy and sensationalistic) there undoubtably exists are far right wing media that a sizeable number of Americans get their news from.  Through well researched analysis (Al Franken's research team 'Team Franken' consists of 14 Harvard graduate students), Franken paints an absolutely damning portrait of a right wing media machine that not only gets it's talking points directly from the current White House, but on a daily basis will go out of their way to lie and distort the truth to prop up and defend them.<br />Lies focuses on a cadre of 'mainstream' right wing pundits such as Sean Hannity, Brit Hume, Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly.  Franken points out the inequity in Fox shows such as Hannity and Colmes.  He shows how it's not mere happenstance that Fox chose an outspoken, agressive (and extremely loose with the truth) conservative like Sean Hannity to represent the right while choosing a moderate, passive, unassertive, unattractive 'liberal' like Alan Colmes to represent the left.  Franken even recalls confronting Colmes (spelled out in around 6 point type to illustrate his diminuitive role on the show) in the book at a White House function and expressing his anger that he hardly ever refutes Hannity's outright lies, and when he does, it's in Colmes' usual meek and non-confrontative manner.  Colmes attempts to assuage Franken by telling him 'That's not the format of the show' and that they are only allowed to confront the guests and not eachother.  So, essentially Hannity is allowed to lie as much as he would like and Colmesessentially is not allowed to refute him.  Fair and Balanced indeed.<br />While there were many pundits that I would have liked to see the book focus on more (Chris Matthews, Wolf Blitzer, Bob Novak, Jonah Goldberg), I can understand that he wanted to focus on the most agregious offenders.  Not devoting a chapter to Michael Savage (real name Michael Weiner), seemed like a glaring omission however, considering he had two chapters on Ann Coulter.<br />One of my favorite chapters in the book is a mini comic book entitled 'Supply Side Jesus' which in a gut-bustingly funny fashion makes you ask yourself; \\"Conservative Christian?  Isn't that an oxymoron?\\"<br />Oh, did I mention that the book is laugh outload, side splittingly funny?  Funnier than anything Franken did on Saturday Night Live and even funnier than the last book of his that I read, the brilliant and biting 'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot'.  Even if you are a conservative, you have to appreciate the hilarity of this book which takes jabs at both liberals and conservatives.<br />Oh, and conservatives, please check this book out.  I'm not asking you to buy it or anything, just get it from a library or borrow it from a liberal friend of yours.  I promise in the near future I'll be reading Hannity's 'Let Freedom Ring' or Coulter's 'Slander' or 'Treason' or even Jonah Goldberg's 'Bias' in an attempt to remain unbiased, and I recommend you attempt to do the same.  I guarantee you'll find it worth your time, if only to enjoy the humor or to attempt to pick it apart.	2003-08-28

Has Franken learned nothing from Anne Coulter and Bill O'Reilly and others on the right? <br />Franken's stubborn reliance on facts -- he backs up every claim with real, documented evidence -- coupled with his determination to avoid ad hominem attacks renders his book useless as a counterbalance to attacks from the right.<br />Compared to vague accusations about Clinton's involvement in a string of murders or wild claims that all liberals are traitors, who's going to want to read a carefully detailed, well documented explanation of how the Bush administration ignored Clinton staffers' warnings about terrorism, stonewalled efforts to set up a Department of Homeland Security, and avoided taking measures to prevent an aerial assault on the World Trade Center.<br />The tone is simply not hysterical enough to have an impact on today's political debate.<br />If the Bush presidency has taught us anything it is that this kind of naive, old-fashioned intellectual honesty is a quaint anachronism. Big, bold, outrageous lies are needed if we are to fight conservatives on their own ground.<br />Nice try Al, but no cigar.	2003-08-28

I generally consider myself a conservative, which makes me an unlikely reader of this book. However, watching Franken blast Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly -- the heirs to Mort Downey Jr. -- I must say I loved this book. Coulter and O'Reilly are nothing more than shock jocks who have somehow managed to be taken seriously by the mainstream media. For the most part, their lies are well-documented and Franken had my rolling in my chair. I was not fond of the Bob Jones set-up, which did nothing but prove that Franken is not below lying and distorting for a cheap (and unfunny) laugh. The abstenience letter was incredibly stupid, regardless if Franken put it on a Knights of Columbus letterhead. However, the book is worth reading just for his chapter on the Paul Wellstone memorial. At the time, I was appalled by the politicization of the memorial for a Senator who I disagreed with, but ultimately respected. Franken makes a persuasive case that what was said at the memorial was taken out context and distorted by Republicans. I would recommend buying the book and a few grains of salt.	2003-08-28

I think most if not all of what he writes about is accurate but he does do some nitpicking.  Having said that, though, this book is hilarious and merciless at the same time.  If you're tired of hearing and seeing arch conservatives complain all the time about the media, blissfully ignoring the fact that they're part of the media, all the while ignoring the truth and making up &quot;facts&quot; as they go along then this is the book for you.<br />Franken skewers Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and their boss Rupert Murdoch and that's just in the first third of the book.  He does it deftly using their own words against them framed within his own wise-guy voice.  A lot of research went into this book and he backs up the statements he makes, which must make conservatives furious.<br />When did being a liberal become a bad thing?  I don't know but it's about time we, and I'm proud to say I'm a liberal, start fighting back and this is a funny step in the right, I mean the correct, direction.  Enjoy!	2003-08-28

But it also marks the biggest stride FOX has made towards fulfilling the \\"balanced\\" part of their motto:<br />Thanks to that arch-conservative, spin-rich, selective-coverage network that usually presents only the pig-headed narrow-vision clap-trap of the middle-right, I've been exposed to a scathing piece of liberal fun-poking.<br />Being part of that balancing act is worth the price of admission alone. Think about it: Franken had to write a book, and even be funny a few times, in order to stick a thorn in FOX's side.

There's only only one tiny problem: Evan Thomas's father is . . . EVAN THOMAS SR.)  Al sets up his jabs at the Lying Liars like the skilled comic he is.

Franken takes the hard right conservative press to task by holding it up to a simple standard--do they tell the truth when they make political arguments? He's not painting political conservatives as a whole with a broad brush--are you reading Anne Coulter?--but focusing on specific commentators--Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity and so on and the ways in which they misrepresent some facts and outright lie about others. Anne Coulter says the NYTimes ignored the death of Dale Earnhart, Sr., for three days and then finally wrote a snobbish article about NASCAR? Franken reproduces the front page from the NYTimes the day after his death, which features a straigthforward news story about the death. Throughout the book, he does this over and over and over and over. And he throws in some pretty funny jokes along the way.<br />A criticism of the book will inevitably be that he picks up on a few minor discrepancies and blows them out of proportion. This misses the point. In accumulating a library of lies large and small, Franken shows how cynically people of poor conscience but great resources affect our national political debate. These lies are echoed throughout the national press, which is too lazy to bother to check the facts themselves in their search for ratings or readers, another argument he makes throughout, that the press does not have a liberal bias but a corporate bias--whatever is cost-efficient and brings readers/viewers is what is printed/airs, not whatever serves a liberal bias.<br />The danger, of course, is that like Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly and the rest, Franken will preach to his own choir. What separates his work from the others, though, is that it is not only passionately argued but factually accurate, something people of good will have to respect.<br />Since I got the book two days ago, I've read it late into the night after putting my 3 year old son to bed. I fear for his sake the emerging Dickensian importance on individual fortunes at the expenseof the common good. It's unAmerican, as Teddy Roosevelt, last century's greatest republican president, argued many times. I really believe that if Bush thought he could get away with it, he'd repeal the 40-hour workweek (he has in part, by allowing employers to reclassify broad groups of workers to avoid paying them overtime), the minimum wage and maybe even child labor laws. Boring topics, but important to those who work, which admittedly is fewer people these days.<br />Franken's books helps cut through the pollution of false statements and aims to reframe political debate in this country based on the simple premise that one should tell the truth. And face exposure for not doing so.<br />This is a much mroe serious and angry book than Rush Limbaugh... It's every bit as funny too.	2003-08-28

Now I know...the truth.<br />This book is the quitissential retort to the relentless barrage of right-wing distortions, lies and outright intimidations that has been sprewing across America like the final scene in an adult film.  In a very concise package, Mr. Franken (sounds like Mr. President, doesn't it) takes on that shrill harpy of the right, Ann Coulter (better known as McCarthy's Love Monkey).  He also skewers Fox's own bloated windbag of petulance (Bill O'Reilly) and that camera friendly disfuntional, Sean Hannity (A man whose only two qualifications for his job are first rate hair and third rate ideas).<br />This book is a must read for anyone sick of the deceptive, sound-bite driven politics that have destroyed the American economy and security since the Thief-in-Chief took (the) office.	2003-08-28

There is real anger in Al's book, anger at the way these people are taken seriously, anger and frustration that the uninformed might be taken in by the nonsense that Coulter and her ilk spout.<br />Al is hilarious in his visit to Bob Jones U, in his dissection of the aforementioned list of 'wingers, and in the short stories 'Operation Chickenhawk', and 'The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus&quot; (both illustrated by comics artist Don Simpson, of 'Megaton Man fame). Most of all, I enjoyed and was moved by the chapter on the Wellstone Memorial, and how the Republicans twisted the pain and emotion mourners felt over the death of friends into a political club to beat the Democrats with. Frankens' anger and wit are sharp and cold in this chapter, heartfelt, and a little bewildered at the cynicism of the Republicans. Must be read to be believed. I know that the left has lies of its own to answer for, but sullying peoples' reputations for cheap political points is not the way either party should be acting.

One was \\"Seabiscuit\\", which is about a plucky little horse. The other is \\"Lies (and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them)\\" by Al Franken, who is a plucky little comedian and fabulously well-received corporate speaker.<br />These are both really, really great books. Both are filled with great truths, a lot of heart and emotion, and each has its own tale about standing together against the establishment and winning. Actually, there was more winning in \\"Seabiscuit\\". But I have to admit that \\"Lies\\" is waaaay funnier than \\"Seabiscuit\\" (the book, anyway -- the horse was reportedly quite a punster).<br />In \\"Seabiscuit\\" there's a compelling story about a huge pile of horse manure that had accumulated over many years near the racetrack in Tijuana. <br />One night it started to rain and the place became flooded. The water seeped under the dung heap and the thing started to move. Pretty soon, the entire fecal mountain went sliding across the racetrack and out the gates until it finally disintegrated in a horrible, stinking mass right there in the middle of town.<br />Similarly, in \\"Lies\\" Al Franken takes us on a detailed tour of the steaming heap of poop that suffices for conservative thought in America. Maybe that should be \\"conservative movement\\".<br />Al and his fifteen member brain trust (\\"TeamFranken\\") expose and easily refute the myriad lies and stupidity foisted on the public by pundits like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and politicians like, oh, the entire Bush administration. <br />\\"Lies\\" is also similar to \\"Seabiscuit\\" because it tells the truth in such a compelling manner that you instinctively *know* it's true, and the truth is even backed up by something called \\"facts\\". If you've ever been confused by right-wing rhetoric and you know in your heart that it's wrong but you can't quite put your finger on why -- get this book. It fingers the right quite a bit.<br />Let's hope that Al Franken's book is like the beginning of that rain in Tijuana. Buy the book. Share it with your friends. Better yet, make them buy the book. Share the book (or even some of the truths in it) with some conservatives and maybe it will make them question the lies they hear every day on Fox TV and talk radio.  Once the word gets out, maybe that whole steaming pile of dung will start to slink off and disintegrate. <br />But make no mistake. There are very few references in \\"Lies\\" to horses. OK, Ann Coulter maybe.  And a little thing about the civil war. But that's it.	2003-08-28

Al and his able assistants (aka TeamFranken) are spot on in reporting on the shoddiness of Coulter's &quot;footnoting&quot;, the claims of Peabody(no)Polk(wrong) award &quot;winning&quot;(okay not really) O'Reilly and the outright lies and shady deals of the Bush administration.<br />But it is the chapters on Paul Wellstone's memorial service and the White House Press Corps Dinner that make this book worth every penny. I dare you not to cry in frustration at the twisting of a heart-felt tribute to a decent man, his family and friends by the press (shame on you all!) and cry tears of joy when Franken confronts Paul Wolfowitz at the  Press Corps dinner. Paul's succinct, if rude,  reply to Al's comment about Clinton's military winning Bush's war is priceless.  Buy this book in hardcover!

I have read books from all political & social ideologies. <br />Al Franken (AKA Stuart Smalley), is an incredible satirist, creative and fluid.<br />Franken exposes hundreds of factual errors, misrepresentations distortions and blatant lies by such people as Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Bernard Goldberg and Sean Hannitty. It's all documented stuff in Franken's book. I double-checked some of his references today. <BR>I read Bill O'Reilly's response editorial where he called Franken a \\"smear artist\\". No-where in this article did Bill O'Reilly state what parts of Franken's book is inaccurate.<BR>I also watched the CSPAN Book Seller Conven, where O'Reilly claims he was ambushed and picked on by liberals. O'Reilly really is the childish bully who cries when he gets smacked.<br />I believe even if you are a conservative; the excesses and arrogant lies of right-wing commentators will floor you.	2003-08-28

While Al's satire sometimes gets tiresome, the content of his book is excellent and humorous.  It doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator, which most people who enjoy reading, both conservative and liberal, are not.<br />As an aside, the fox tag line 'We Report You Decide' turns out to be a lie.

One of the most refreshing aspects of Al Franken's writing is his ability to stay on focus and clearly state (and support) his facts. In a time when so much of the media is being overrrun by boorish conservative pundits and artificial &quot;information&quot;, it's nice to be able to step back and look at the facts. And the facts, as presented here, have scary ramifications. Thankfully, Franken will have you laughing just long enough to take the sting off of harsh reality. Where is our country going and what can we do about it? At the very least, regardless of your political affiliation, we should all start demanding truth and accountability. Keep up the good work, Al.	2003-08-27

If you have ever watched fox news and wanted to scream then this is your book.  Al Franken does a wonderful job of using the right wing's own lies to expose them and make us laugh.  The book is incredibly funny and intelligent.  Mr. Franken documents and exposes all the conservative lies most liberals have been seething about for years.  Mr. Franken uses transcripts from Bill O'Lielly (O'Rielly), Sean Hannity, Ann Coulture and others to expose either their stupidity or out right lies.  The great part is that he isn't just name-calling, he is using their own words to expose them (he does like to name call too).  Strange silence has emerged from the right after the Fox lawsuit was thrown out of court because they can't defend themselves.  A great victory for the left and an outright embarrassment for the right.  The funniest book I've read since Stupid White Men.	2003-08-27

Bolstered by the research talents of a team of Harvard students, Franken exposes and dismantles the lies of the Bush administration and their propogandists in the right-wing media (along with all manner of amusing diversions).  Of course, no single book could comprehensively refute all the lies that gang is pumping out, but Franken and team do an impressively thorough job.  Anyone with a open mind is going to be persuaded by Franken's logic and impressive research.  Of course, most people who read this book will probably already agree with him.  But even fellow travelers will learn a lot.  And anyone with a mischievous sense of humor will be hugely entertained.  I don't often laugh out loud, but this book had me braying like some kind of madman.  (Those with delicate sensibilities should be forewarned that Franken's humor is often delightfully raunchy and profane.)	2003-08-27

I bought this book solely because of the frivolous lawsuit brought by Fox News at the behest of Bill O'Reilly.  It arrived today and over the past several hours I have gotten through the first hundred and fifty pages.  So far, it seems to be extremely well researched and documented (although I haven't checked all the facts) and definitely gives the reader some pause for thought about the veracity of much of the anti liberal 'facts' spewed forth nightly by a variety of right wing pundits.  I particularly like the way that Al Franken methodically presents his case and mixes it with suitable amount of humor and cynicism resulting, ultimately, in a very entertaining and thought provoking read.<br />Frankly, I am amazed by a seemingly endless list of half-truths, misstatements, and outright falsehoods that are attributed to Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, The Administration, etc.  Shouldn't our nation's journalists be asking some hard questions?<br />This book is a must read for liberals, conservatives and centrists alike.

At the same time, Franken uncovers and exposes common lies that have been perpetrated on the American public by our politicians and media. Franken doesn't pull many punches and goes after Coulter, Limbaugh, Cheney, Bush, O'Rielly, Falwell, and many others, often showing them to be liars simply by quoting them. Al's hit on a strategy which may help counter the current culture of lies: &quot;We have to fight back. But we can't fight like they do. The Right's entertainment value comes from their willingness to lie and distort.

O'Reilly seems to be pathologically unable to admit a mistake/lie.  It is so refreshing to get the \\"rest of the story\\" on so many \\"facts\\" that have been trumpeted by the \\"right\\". It was absolutely wonderful of the Fox News network to take the effort to make this book a best seller - you can't buy that kind of publicity as they say. I must admit, that I tend to avoid listening to many of the liars described in the book - I guess I am a weak person and don't have the ability to sit quietly and not manifest my awareness that \\"taffy is being distributed\\" - to quote Mark Twain. I have looked ahead at some of the chapters - the titles are so enticing - loved Ch 32 \\"Thank God for Jerry Falwell\\".

Can I really be the first person to review a book which is an Amazon #1 best-seller, and which has been discussed in the elite cyber-bytes of the \\"Drudge Report\\" and which is the subject of a major Intellectual Property lawsuit?  Impossible.<br />If I am the first, then let me say that I have not read the book.  And I do not intend to.  But since 99% of the Congress did not read every single page of the USA PATRIOT Act, not to mention umpty-ump other things that their crack staff will 'get to' reading just after they finish other important stuff they forgot to finish or couldn't quite get through (such as \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"), but which will pass into the law of our land, I feel perfectly qualified to review this book.<br />Fact of the matter is, Al Franken may be right or he may be wrong but he is a lonely man.  That is, name one other person you can describe with the words \\"funny\\" and \\"Democrat\\" in the same sentence.  Think about it:  Dan Quayle is still a Republican and Franklin Roosevelt is hard to call funny, given the wheelchair and all.  Bill Clinton is, oh never mind.  I suppose the fact that it bends to the left is funny.<br />So Al Franken has done us a proud American service.  Not that we didn't already know Bill O'Reilly was an arse.  But never before has it been so articulately explained exactly why and how he is an arse.  Oh, now I get it.  Thanks, Al.  At least I assume that's what you do in this book.  But how hard can that be?  O'Reilly ought to walk around with toilet paper stuffed up his nose, just for those who are too slow to catch on.<br />But crying out loud, Al, why waste all this ink taking these people seriously.  Well, OK, let's face facts, the nutcases and numbnutzes of he right-wing media are the only fair and balanced target left for a conscientous left-winger.  Our famously fumblemouthed President has been fatally misunderestimated.  Regardless of what you might think of George W., he is clearly not the vacant caretaker President.  No, he got hold of that army and did bold something with it.  Whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, I leave to the cordial civilized discussions on freerepublic.com (and to subsequent Amazon reviewers) but it's important to note that serious issues are entirely another subject from those matters covered here in Franken's pleasant tome, which skewers only liars.  Consciously mendacious people and such.<br />Speaking of whom, let me say that, since I didn't read the book, I especially liked the part where Ann Coulter smears chocolate all over her body.  And the part where Sean Hannity dips his member in a vase of urine.  Oh, that's good stuff.  I can't wait to read what Franken really wrote.  But who cares about the truth, really - it's all about scoring points.  <br />And believe me, when Fox News sees the Polaroids I've got of Al Franken - at least I'm pretty sure that was him - at this slutty motel in Hoboken, plus the footage from Vegas - hah, the points will be all mine.  The only thing fair and balanced in these pictures is the incredible symmetricality of the hooters on either side of Franken's schlong.  Whoo-oo, and to think I only paid that windbag Poindexter $50 for these secret spy satellite photosnaps.  Take that, you liberal!	2003-08-27

It's a very quick read, and never lets up its intensity -- a \\"rollicking rollercoaster ride,\\" to use movie-critic verbiage.<br />The book is mostly a critique of right-wing media, specifically the Fox News Channel.  In this, it is similar to Franken's earlier book, \\"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot\\", although its aim is much broader.  \\"Lies\\" reads better, in large part because Limbaugh, politics aside, is at least a skilled radio entertainer.  Current right-wing media figures like Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity come across in \\"Lies\\" as being alternately clueless and transparently malicious, without being especially talented in their respective media.<br />Franken wisely alternates withering analyses of the afore-mentioned personalities' statements with hilarious anecdotes from his own experience as a B-level celebrity who nonetheless often rubs shoulders with the rich and powerful in the political world.  This keeps the book from having a monotonous feel to it and holds the reader's interest.<br />You won't like this book if you're a political conservative who thinks that any attack on the current self-appointed conservative spokespeople is also an attack on you.  And if you're liberal-leaning, then much of this will be preaching to the choir (even if it's a nice savory sort of preaching).  For this reason I give \\"Lies\\" four out of five stars.<br />Anyone else, however, from open-minded conservative to centrist to nominally apolitical, will get a big kick out of the book.

First, commensurate, with Franken's skills as a `hilarious corporate speaker' and Saturday Night Live Vet, it is very very funny, which cannot be claimed of the ever increasing number of screeds from either end of the political spectrum.  Second, it is dead on accurate in calling out the way the right has publicly told lie upon lie and the media has either willfully or lazily fallen for it, the biggest being the repeated lie about how liberal the media is.  This is an important function when such lying bullies as Anne Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and Sean Hannity trot out the talking points, distorted facts, or plain wrong statistics to muddy the public discourse.  <br />Example after example of easily caught distortions are brought up--I loved his retelling of the incident with Bernard Goldberg where he nailed him about the late John Chancellor's commentary on the Soviet Union after the failed coup.  <br />Particularly important and, frankly, appalling in its implications, is Franken's discussion of the media coverage surrounding Paul Wellstone's memorial service of last year. Key point:  HE WAS ACTUALLY THERE!  In contrast, many notable personalities of the conservative punditocracy lined up to condemn the memorial without having seen more, at most, than the 20 second clips on TV. Franken makes it clear that brief and spontaneous flurries of emotionally driven partisanship were shamelessly exploited by the right to help boost the Republican majority in congress.  That really disgusts me.<br />Repeatedly, Franken nails the celebreties of the right by confronting them with what they said vs. the facts, and repeatedly I came away laughing. His description of interactions with Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Karl Rove, Bill Bennett, and Barbara Bush are, in particular, very, very funny. <br />Franken is a national treasure, a Puck of the left unafraid to <BR>attack the right by confronting them with their own material and he left this readers laughing, which made it much easier to take the accompanying anger and sadness over the way the right has hijacked public discourse in this country.  <br />He also provides a role model for how we on the left can begin to reclaim our place in the political realm of the USA while being fierce, but not shrill, and maintaining both our integrity and sense of humor. <br />Bravo, Al, and TeamFranken!	2003-08-27

I now know why Bill O'Reilly et al hate Franken so much; the stinging truth of his commentary cannot be denied. I was glad to see the release date pushed up so that I could end my summer with an entertaining and insightful read that never loses sight of the fact that at bottom, we need to retain our sense of humor even in the face of madness. Franken uses the words of Coulter, O'Reilly, Goldberg, and Hannity to indict them, pointing out shoddy research and deliberate dishonestly. The notion, for example, that Coulter's books are \\"serious\\" because they contain footnotes is nothing but a fraud; Franken breaks it all down and shows how she uses such footnotes to fool the reader. He recounts his devastating attack on liar Goldberg while on the Donahue show, and shows how time and time again, the Fox News talking heads take quotes out of context and use false statistics to \\"prove\\" their points. Franken also has a few illustrated sections, including a charming little comic strip \\"Supply Side Jesus.\\" Franken is the real deal -- an educated, self-deprecating, wise commentator who understands better than most the Right's lies and liars.

I've read previous works of Al Franken, including \\"Rush Limgbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot And Other Observations,\\" and I'd have to conclude that this is his best work, by far.  Franken takes to task the Right-wing media, exposing their deceits, lack of interest in portraying the truth or \\"Fair and Balanced (tm)\\" honesty in reporting, and political agenda as unbridled lackeys of the conservative movement.  Humerous and frightening at the same time, it's hard to see the world in the same light once you read this book.  In some, it may even bring about a paradigm shift in your thinking.  <br />This book is brimming with honesty, and it's hard not to feel flabbergasted at the sheer audacity of the Right-wing media, especially when Franken speaks his mind on matters that you already knew or suspected.  Buy this book: While Franken sprinkles his wit throughout the book, its content is too keen to ignore, and too important to forget.

Admittedly, I've always been a fan of Franken, but he's outdone himself this time.  This book has been overdue -- and I don't meen at the library either.  I've been waiting for somebody -- anybody -- to pick apart the Coulters, O'Reillys, and Bushies for a year or two now.<br />As expected, Franken is absolutely hilarious.  But he doesn't just use humor to dissect the Lying Liars on the Right; he uses hard, cold facts.  With a team of researchers, he has documented lie after lie after lie that spews from the mouth of Ann, Bill, or Sean.  You'll be pleased at the number of graphs, charts, and transcripts in Franken's book.<br />After reading &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;, I'm now equipped with evidence -- real evidence -- that many conservative pundits really are arrogant, lying, self-serving pricks willing to distort reality for political gain.<br />One of the best things Franken said was how conservatives love America like a 4-year old loves her mommy:  mommy is wonderful and anyone who criticizes mommy is terrible.  Liberals love America like grown-ups:  actually understanding what you love, taking both the bad and the good, and helping the one you love grow.<br />I just hope Howard Dean picks Al Franken as a running mate!	2003-08-27

I had worried that it would be nothing more than a rant making cheap shots against the right that were easily dismissed. Instead Al seems to have set out to prove that a political hatchet job (which the book unquestionably is) can be both funny and accurate.<br />Al has an important message, right wing pundits have been lying to us repeatedly and for years. Far from failing to give these pubdits a platform the 'liberal media' have repeated their attacks without question. Jayson Blair was not the only journalist reporting stories he never researched. <br />While the Fox lawsuit against Franken will inevitably color people's view, this book is about far more than one far right cable news channel. It is also a good read, I read the whole book on a plane flight in one go. I would personaly prefer it if Al dropped the humor entirely and just stuck to the real story without any 'kidding' which detracts from his main message.	2003-08-27

I didn't expect a book that had received so much hype to be more than mildly amusing, but Al Franken has raised the bar for political satire with this effort. He proves that simply telling the truth about the right-wing blowhards who rule the airwaves can be hilariously uplifting. No one since Twain has deflated hypocrisy so deftly.

I think this is the big difference between Franken and Coulter.  Coulter can only screech out her incredulous and frothy bile in a wild-eyed stupor, while Franken actually takes the time and effort to research, document and substantiate his facts, and then has the ability to present his material in an intelligent though thoroughly entertaining manner. Perhaps Coulter can hire out Franken's research assistants (TeamFranken), assuming of course that she's ever used them.  Or researched.<br />This is the funniest book of the year, while at the same time, one of the most terrifying.  We can only hope that America will finally wake itself up after its 9/11-induced, semi-comatosed state, and realize that they've been repeatedly lied to and their trust violated by this shameless and corrupt administration.

Franken, however, is a master of satire, displaying his first-rate wit in chapter after chapter.  Moving beyond the satire, which is initself vicious and appropriate, Franken's book succeeds in debunking the hysterical vocies from the right-wing media.  Standout moments include Franken's decimation of the demented Ann Coulter and a catalogue of the various fictions of Bill O'Rielly.

Turns out Franken's accusations of Coulter are either wrong, suspect, or petty (He calls her a liar for using the word \\"footnote\\" to mean \\"endnote\\". Gimme a break!). He says Coulter dazes and confuses readers by writing misleading endnotes, but if you check the direct source, you'll discover that Franken conveniently abridges Coulter's full citations, thereby misleading his *own* readers. Franken also calls Coulter a liar for claiming Evan Thomas is the son of 6-time Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas (Coulter did inaccurately say 4-time). In an endnote of his own, he provides the punchline: Evan is Norman's GRANDson. Well, Franken needs his glasses checked, because Coulter wrote \\"grandson\\" all along.<br />In short, Franken is another liberal whiner who just can't stand being on the losing side.	2003-08-26

I am a critical person and I don't hand out kudos easily.  I must warn you that the conservative right will probably not like this book.  Franken exposes the lies and deceits of the likes of Ann Coulter - the Queen of Mean, Bill O'Reilly - the Dude of Rude, Shawn Hannity - as in calamity, and others.  Even a right wing, or is it right wind or wrong wind, conservative might learn something if he/she can keep an open mind.  And then to be honest with themselves, they would have to consider changing their orientation.  The book is filled with examples of the lies of those listed above, Bush, Cheney, etc. ad nauseum.  I don't see how any involved American can avoid reading this book-unless of course they are unwilling to hear the &quot;truth&quot; and prefer the lies put out by much of the right and much of the right wing media.  Oh, I'm a moderate and not easily taken in by either side.

After experiencing all of the publicity surrounding this book, I ordered it immediately and have not been disappointed.<br />It takes a talented person to write a literate analysis of a complicated subject such as politics.  It takes a once in a generation comic mind to keep all of the facts and figures truthful and provide a scathing and hilarious take on politics and the conservative movement in America.<br />I truly enjoyed the hilarious irony of using an outrageous and inflammatory book title to point out the outrageous and inflammatory journalistic styles of many of his targets.<br />If you're a conservative, buy one copy and fume.  If you're a liberal, buy one copy to savor and one to make a conservative friend fume.<br />Al Franken once proclaimed the 1980's, &quot;The decade of Al Franken.&quot;  This book may find many readers chanting for the &quot;millennium of Al Franken.&quot;	2003-08-26

With great humor and aplomb, Al Franken explains some of the many lies told by right wingers such as bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, and the whole Faux News crowd.  It even documents them with actual footnotes!<br />Yeah, I know what you're gonna say -- Anne Coulter averages over 800 footnotes per book.  Bzzzt, wrong!   Coulter uses endnotes.  What's the difference?  Franken shows how it's easier to lie with endnotes, and documents the six ways Coulter lies with them.  For example, Coulter spends a paragraph discussing a New York Times editorial about Clarence Thomas called \\"The Youngest, Cruelest Justice.\\"  In the paragraph, Coulter says 'Thomas is not engaged on the substance of his judicial philosophy.  He is called ... \\"chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom,\\"[39] ... \\"Benedict Arnold\\"[40] and \\"Judas Iscariot.\\"[41]' The bracketed numbers are Coulter's endnote numbers.  Here's Franken's commentary:<br />Okay.  What percentage of Coulter's readers do you suppose read this and thought, \\"My God! The New York Times called Clarence Thomas a 'chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom'! I knew the Times was bad, but I never dreamed it was this bad!\\"?  High nineties?  And what percentage do you think ever bothered to go to the back of her book and wade through the endnotes to discover that the quote came from a playboy interview with former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and from a black leader at a meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference wh was quoted in the New Yorker.<br />In spite of all these facts, the book is riotously funny!  Here's how chapter 19 (of 43 chapters), titled 'Who Created the Tone' begins:<br />\\"Scumbag,\\" \\"sociopath,\\" \\"perpetual preener,\\" \\"rapist,\\" \\"unserious,\\" \\"craven miscreant.\\"(1)  Sound like anyone you know? I mean, besides Steven Seagal?(2)  Actually, it was the forty-second president of the United States, Bill Clinton, who was called all of these things.  In my day, we never used such language to describe the President,unless he was a real a$%#ole like Nixon.<BR>(1) [in a footnote at the bottom of the page, Franken give the citations for all these quotes; all were in Washington Post or Times.]<BR>(2) Just kidding. I have never heard of Steven Seagal being referred to as a \\"rapist,\\" or a \\"sociopath.\\" Or \\"unserious.\\"<br />Chapter 29, 'Operation Chickenhawk' makes great fun of the excuses given by various Bush administration biggies for avoiding the draft (e.g. Cheney: \\"had other priorities\\").<br />In chapters 33 and 34, (Abstinence Heroes I & II) Franken writes to a bunch of Bush admin biggies soliciting \\"personal stories of abstinance heroes for our nation's young people to emulate.\\"  Short, but extremely funny.<br />I bought this book (from a local bookstore -- I wanted to be sure I had a first impression), and I've found it amusing, enlightening, and informative.  But perhaps I'm biased.  At least I'm willing to admit it!	2003-08-26

But this book is just as good.  Franken spends the first part of the book asserting prominent conservative pundits look dishonest and/or stupid.  If you consider this sort of sport cheap and mean spirited, then you probably won't like the rest of the book.  He does, however, do a pretty effective job of mixing legitimate research (by his Harvard students not him, he is quick to point out) with really good jokes to make his point.  Which he makes especially well against Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly, if you have any specific taste.  (And funny too.)  Then, sustaining a somewhat off-putting indignation, he launches into articulating the bitter sentiments of the strangely mute left towards the Bush Administration.  If you are one of those embattled lefties (like me) who hasn't ever heard anyone else really go after present policies and politics in an effective way, this book is great.  (And again funny.)  I'm not sure I would purchase this book if I were a Fox News enthusiast because it would probably make me furious and serve little purpose.  But if you are on the left end of the spectrum this book is a long sought tonic for a bruised political awareness.  (And really really funny.)	2003-08-26

If you're a Republican, you will hate some of Franken's ridicule. His rhetoric is just as outrageous as Limbaugh and Coulter are from the right, but the huge difference is Al Franken has the facts to support his anger. With the assistance of a bunch of bright scholars from Harvard's Kennedy School, his TeamFranken, plus many other very knowledgeable friends, he repeatedly nails the pernicious and pervasive lies of the Bush administration and its media apologists.  Example: Ann Coulter: \\"She was born in 1961. Or 1963. Depending on whether you believe her old Connecticut driver's license (1961) or her newer D.C. driver's license. Ann claims the D.C. license is correct, which means that when she registered to vote she was 16. That, of course, would be voter fraud.\\" <BR>    Most of Franken's ire is directed at far more serious lies than Ann Coulter's prevaricating about her birthday.  He is furious, with reason, not only at the lies of the Right but of the failure of the \\"liberal\\" media to expose those lies.  \\"Liberal\\" media?  As Franken points out, two thirds of newspapers, reaching 58% of all readers, endorsed George W. Bush in 2000. The \\"liberal\\"media were silent when rightwingers like Sean Hannity claimed Clinton gutted the military. They failed to point out, as Franken does, that 70% of the bombs and missiles used in Gulf War II were smart weapons, compared with just 10% in the first Gulf War. They failed to note that in Aug. 2000 Dick Cheney said \\"A commander in chief leads the military built by those who came before him.... It is all the work of previous administrations.... And when that war [the first Gulf War] ended, the first thing I did was to place a call to California and say thank you to President Reagan.\\" As Franken says, \\"You suppose Clinton is waiting for Rumsfeld's call?\\"<BR>   Again, please, please read this. If you're a liberal it will give you facts to support your arguments and confirm your reasons for anger. If you're conservative it will give you food for thought - and lots of explaining to do.	2003-08-26

It should be required reading for people with sane political opinions; but it should probably be required reading for Republicans, too -- just so they know what they're really voting for.<br />What impresses me most about this book is that though Franken really lays into the right (&quot;Sean [Hannity] may be evil, but he's not smart&quot;), he doesn't come across as mean-spirited or as vitriolic as those that he writes about (Ann Coulter, etc.) do.  And I don't think this is just because I agree with his political opinions.  Franken is funny, of course, but comes across as particularly human -- you get the sense that he's a good guy trying to figure things out, who has good intentions, who's big enough to admit it when he makes a mistake, and who's strong enough to call other on their mistakes when no one else will.  <br />It's also really funny.  And I mean funny.  Like, laugh out loud funny.  Maybe you're the kind of person that laughs out loud at books.  I'm not normally.  But I was here.<br />Unfortunately, I don't have the capacity to check all of Franken's facts, so I can't comment on how comprehensive his numbers, etc. are.  What I can say is he does present his ideas in a well thought-out fashion and isn't boring.  It's hard to be both at once.  I know because I'm trying to be both right now.  <br />This is satire par excellence, satire that uses the very words and forms of those he's satirizing to show how ridiculous their statements can be.  By making a list of all of the ludicrous things Ann Coulter says about Democrats (&quot;Liberals hate society,&quot; etc.) , he deflates her rhetoric.  By making a veritable catalogue of Bill O'Reilly's lies, Franken makes O'Reilly look like nothing more than a bully.  The right-wing pundits and politicians are humanized in the same way that Franken humanizes himself; only they come across as very bad humans, and Franken comes across a real human, a good one.  While he's funny with silly jokes about &quot;Bill O'Lie-lly,&quot; Franken is at his most effective when revealing the pettiness and smallness of his victims.  He's also particularly good at chiding those on his side when they don't make their opinions known more forcefully.  His treatment of Alan Colmes in this respect may be a little harsh, but darn it, it's funny.  <br />I recommend this book whether you're into politics or not.  If you're not, you will be after you're done.  If you are, it'll be a good laugh and you'll learn a lot.  Also, you should buy it because it'll make Fox News mad, and that's fun for everyone.	2003-08-26

Unfortunately, this product demonstrates a poor quality of humor that leans heavily on the author's personal bias and a need to profit from the common practice that the liberally leaning media and entertainment industry has to devour it's own.  I am speaking specifically of bashing the conservative and, yes even moderate members of the industry.  In this case Franken has taken the low road of political hypocrisy and attempts to bash certain elements of what he calls &quot;The Right&quot; for bashing &quot;The Left&quot;.  In order to appreciate this book (or any of Franken's political humor for that matter), one must be capable of completely ignoring the fact that certain elements of the infamous &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; have learned the lessons taught by decades of hard core politicking by the Democratic Party's ultra &quot;liberal&quot; wing (&quot;The Left&quot; as opposed to &quot;The Right&quot;).  These lessons include &quot;if you say it enough, it will become true&quot;, &quot;if you wag your finger, then you must be sincere&quot;, &quot;if something bad happens to you, it's not your fault - so sue&quot; and &quot;(Pick a nightly news anchor's name) said it, so it must be true&quot;.  What Franken tries to develop is that these lessons are only for those with &quot;liberal&quot; thought (notice I said &quot;thought&quot;, because the limo-liberals and SUV-environmentalists in this country are immune to their own ideas).  He feels that anyone in the media and entertainment industry who does not agree with that premise is wrong, despite the fact that the conservative organizations and individuals in the industry are for the most part a silent minority (similar to conservatives in my state).  He then tries to wrap his sub-standard, personally biased, political analysis with the label of &quot;parody&quot; and &quot;satire&quot;.  I enjoy good political satire and parody.  Well, this is not good at all.  It is just not funny, and since that is the supposed purpose of this literature, well... lack of evidence suggests that the case should be dismissed.

Franken provides hundreds of well-researched counter arguments and elucidates the &quot;fair and balanced&quot; approach at Fox News that leads O'Reilly, Hannity, and the like to exaggerate, bluster, and just plain make stuff up.<br />Ann Coulter and the talking heads of the right are also given attention, including exposing her flat-out lies in the ironically titled &quot;Slander.&quot; Far from creating a He said She said dilemma for the reader to sort through, he provides visual proof in the form of reproductions of newspaper pages, public documents, and other impossible to refute (but try they will)sources that leave no doubt about the veracity of the &quot;No Spin&quot; crowd.<br />And speaking of No Spin, O'Reilly might just spin his head right off his (splotchy) neck in anger and frustration at being caught in his own web of deceit. But then again, he and his compadres might just go back to making up stories about Al Franken, because who needs to take a psychopath seriously...<br />The Prevaricator in Charge,George Bush, is taken to task as well, along with many of this cronies. <br />Hooray to TeamFranken for the terrific work.

If you can recognize the fact that Franken treats his subjects on the Right in the same manner that they treat those on the Left (albeit with a sense of humor), then this is a book for you.  <br />If the Right continues to publish books like Coulter's \\"Treason\\" which deals angrily with her ideological opponents, then the Left surely must continue publishing books by Franken who not only can deftly counter claims made by the Right, but can do it with a sense of humor too.  Disagree with him if you must, but try to do so honorably and with a sense of humor, not like the good people at certain news organizations.<br />This is a book which will proudly be displayed in my collection (once it arrives).	2003-08-26

It says, \\"first printing, September 2003!! Thank you FOX for the early release.<br />Al Franken's new book is funny indeed, and at times it is insightful, illuminating and even vicious. One gets the feeling he has finally taken off the gloves and is ready to get in there and sling it with the best of them. At times  he overstates his case. Like when he catches Bill O'Reilly lying about where he came from, being an independent, the whole Polk/Peabody thing, or catching Ann Coulter lying about her age. These kind of lies, while they may say say a lot about the individuals' personalities, are not all that important. The book might be better if he talked more about the really important lies, but it wouldn't be nearly as funny! Don't get me wrong. He talks a lot about about the big lies, the statistics designed to deceive, the dirty campaign tricks, the dishonest reporting, the conscious effort to mislead the public, etc. <br />Al claims the media does not have a liberal bias, and he makes a decent argument. I disagree with some of his conclusions, but I agree with his contention that news media (left, middle and right) suffer from many more serious biases that undercut their ability to do a good job of reporting. One of my own peeves is their bias toward oversimplification. They seldom take enough time to discuss complicated issues. The excuse is they're always \\"running out of time\\" which is a riduculous notion. I mean they're 24 hour news channels - they literally have all the time in the world!  What they really mean is they are afraid of exceeding the attention span of their viewers. <br />If they are really that short of time, CNN wasted some on Al's Aug. 28 interview with the brainless Paula Zahn  She clearly had not read the book - OK, that's why they have staff. But even so, she did not seem to understand what they had given her.  She used material from his book to apparently catch Al in a lie ofhis own. At least that seemed to be her take on it - she had one of those \\"gotcha\\" looks on her face. The fact that the \\"lie\\" is presented as such in the book and is clearly used for satiric purpose, seems to have been lost on her. <br />On the same day, FOX dropped their lawsuit against Al. At least that was how they described getting trounced in court ( \\"without merit\\"... \\"an easy decision\\"). I'd like to know what former employee at FOX thought it would be a good idea to sue in the first place. What does it say about their standards that they thought they had a case? Why didn't they ask Greta?<br />In summary, the book is funny and worth reading. Even though it's target is the right wing media, the lessons are applicable to all. It should be of value to news viewers to show them the many ways in which they are mislead and deceived. No one should take what they see and hear from these people at face value.  The book does not have an index, so the targets will have to search for their mentions and might even be forced to read whole sections! Al has challenged them to find factual errors. I hope they try. They might learn something.	2003-08-26

Instead of pulling facts out of thin air to support his allegations, though, he uses FACTS - yes, clearly documented, supportable facts - to break down the arguments of the oppressors in our society (I'm talking to you, Bush, Rush, and Ashcroft).

Although all that irreverant wit meant that sometimes Franken's revelations, such as the fact that Bill O'Reilly wrote a novel about a murderous power-hungry newsman who violently kills his critics called \\"Those Who Trespass,\\" left me wondering \\"is that for real?\\" - (disturbingly, it is real, go ahead and do a search for it)<br />If you liked his earlier \\"Big Fat Idiot,\\" then you will certainly enjoy \\"Lies\\" as it is basically a modern version of the same concept but with new subjects and new jokes.

What's the difference between &quot;Ayn&quot; Coulter's Treason and Al Franken's Lies? Franken has the decency to let the reader know when he's making stuff up.<br />It's rare that a book released amid so much media coverage is worth the attention paid to it. Franken's book is one of the few. Truth be told, rebutting the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity is not particularly hard: watching the litigative repartee between Franken and certain disinfotainment celebrities as the book hit the stands was kinda like seeing the Harlem Globetrotters play the Brigham Young University Cougars. No matter how close the other side got to seeming to make a point, Franken would score ludicrously effortlessly.  Reading Lies, I kept hearing someone whistle Sweet Georgia Brown in my imagination.<br />Franken does, as I mentioned, make a bunch of stuff up for humorous effect, but each instance is lovingly footnoted or retracted within the same paragraph. To be fair, some of the jokes are predictable as all getout. Ann Coulter's joke about invading countries, killing leaders, and converting people to Christianity was funnier than some of the potshots in Franken's book.<br />(That Coulter bit WAS a joke, right? I mean, no one would really... really? You mean... Jeez. )<br />Anyway, Franken does indulge in a number of cheap shots along the way: his running typographical joke about Alan Colmes being one example. But you knew that, right? That's why you're thinking of buying the book, right? Be honest, now.<br />Despite the humor - even the freaking GRAPHS are funny - Lies is meticulously researched and compellingly presented. It's a must-read for anyone concerned about the direction in which this country seems to be plummeting under Bush and company. Make the Freepers foam at the mouth: buy six copies and give them away. That'll boost your self-esteem more than a lifetime of Stuart Smalley videos.	2003-08-25

In writing a satirical political tract, there is a challenge to provide enough detail to thoroughly present and defend your point of view while still being entertaining.  Franken knows this better than anybody, and I bought this book with the hopes that it would match the wit of his Rush Lindbaugh book -- his supposed interviews with Rush's fact checker were particularly funny.<br />This time, Al Franken (instructed by God himself) offers a scathing rebuke of the current crop of Republican pundits and politicians, as well as the media which he feels has become lazy and prone to sensationalism.  He does this while throwing in hilarous barbs about Newt Gingrich's 3rd wife, Bill O'Reilley's splotchy picture on the cover, and the 11 things Sean Hannity knows.

(Get the .PDF online -- it would be a scream if the Fox honchos didn't take themselves so seriously. And they absolutely have no reason to do so. \\"Stellar reputations?\\") <br />Having a familirity with Franken's style of humor since the 1970s and having read another of his books, I expected it to be funny. It is flat-out hilarious, but two chapters are particularly moving. He recounts the actual events and eventual media spin surrounding Senator John McCain's inexcusable drubbing in the South Carolina primary and the late Senator Paul Wellstone's funeral. In both cases, he clearly demonstrates that the right-wing attack dogs have no scruples, and that mainstream journalists have no sense of history, no sense of objectivity, no sense of what professional research involves, or no sense. <br />Mr. Franken's interacts with many of his targets. The so-called conservative pundits parade their zealotry, duplicity and intolerance on every page. It appears that unless the right-wingers are using vitriolic humor to savage the Clintons, labor unions, Muslims or the poor, they can't take a joke. Franken expertly takes them to task by being, as my circle of friends likes to say, \\"funny on the square.\\"	2003-08-25

And rightfully so. Certain politicians and their lapdogs in the media deserve the whuppin' they get in this sure-fire best-seller.  It should be noted, however, that Al Franken takes care not to fire buckshot at the Republican party or the media as a whole.  He's careful to go after the most rabid cases and the whoppers they tell.<br />The deserving victims include Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Hannity and his benign sidekick (colmes), Bush, Cheney, and Ashcroft.  They get it with both barrels. And Franken's ammo (read: sources) are impeccable.<br />Like Michael Moore's &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; last year, &quot;LIES&quot; is poised become a major pain in the right wing's keester between now and the 2004 elections.

I bought this book yesterday and am already halfway through it (if I read faster, I would have probably been done by now). Franken is extremely clever in the way he dismantles the claims of Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Fox News at-large and many others.<br />Fox News brought upon themselves the wrath of a U.S. District Judge who openly mocked their claims that this book's title was satire, but the Judge isn't the only one to make digs at Fox News. My favorite part about this book (to date) is how it dismantles Fox News' claims that it is &quot;fair and balanced,&quot; and O'Reilly's claims that he is not conservative.<br />All in all, its fun to read. Franken's writing style is extremely easy to follow and entertaining... especially the way he tries to spruce up boring old facts and charts with his off-handed comments. Recommended for anybody out there who is fed up with the conservative hacks that rule talk radio and the Fox News Channel.	2003-08-25

In any event, conservative believers won't be happy with this book -- not after the way O'Reilly, Annie Coulter and Sean Hannity are humiliated in public.

What this would amount to would be to try to \\"have it both ways,\\" or to have the reader give Franken credit for being \\"a joke that the reader missed\\" if he is found wrong and to believe faithfully as fact if no error is noticed.  Franken makes just such a self-justifying claim in his own \\"Note from the author.\\"<br />But Al Franken has attempted to put his hybrid-mirth-serious-accusations into effect to attack conservatives by publishing his book: Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them -- A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.<br />Right off the top, on the very cover of his book, is one of Franken's most outrageous falsehoods, \\"Fair and Balanced.\\"  He knows it is not true, by his own admissions, yet he states it boldly on the cover.  Here's proof:<br />In Franken's own words, he asked a Harvard associate: \\"Would it be okay if I wrote a scathingly partisan attack on the right-wing media and the Bush administration?\\"  His Harvard fellow liberal said \\"no problem,\\" and helped line up the 14 diligent investigators who helped Franken dig up anything they could that would make conservatives look bad.  Franken also admits freely that he is a liberal, and his book is overwhelmingly obvious as a shamefully vicious attack on the reputations of many conservative thinkers and writers in the U.S.  Franken also uses the very technique he decries in repeating over and over in his book \\"there is no liberal bias in the major media.\\"  However, Bernard Goldberg thoroughly proved the heavy liberal media bias in his own book \\"Bias.\\"  Therefore, Q.E.D., Franken lied when he had the book published with the false claim \\"A Fair and Balanced look at the Right.\\"  (The lie rests on Franken's head regardless of how it got on the cover of his book with his picture disdaining the victims of his attacks; he could have had it removed if he wanted to.)  The book is totally unfair and absolutely slanted with a liberal bias from beginning to end, and Franken knew it all along, by his own admission.  No amount of \\"humor\\" or \\"satire\\" or other squirming attempts to evade responsibility can relieve Franken of direct guilt for repeatedly violating his own premises and for making extremely serious and totally unsupported charges against a number of honest, honorable American writers. <br />This thoroughly dishonest diatribe which attempts to undo the damage to the reputation of the major news media that Bernard Goldberg's expose \\"Bias\\" did is without merit throughout.  Franken gives one or two isolated events that he claims dishonors a given conservative, regardless of the tons of material that the same conservative has presented against the liberal press, which cannot be discredited, so Franken ignores the majority of cases.  Then, he moves on to smear another conservative with very few examples against the person, not discrediting what that conservative has presented factually against the liberal news media.  This is clearly identifiable for what it is--personal attacks against the person when you cannot discredit what that person has said.  Then, Franken compounds the errors by claiming that conservatives never research their facts.  That is simply not true; Franken ignores the mountains of proof that conservatives have already shown of the liberal media, including Goldberg' book which amounts to a reformed liberal admitting the truth and well documenting that liberal bias, by the way.<br />Hopefully, some of his targets will hit Franken right in the dead center of his faulty premises and bring him down where he belongs with the disgrace resting on his head that he so frivously heaps unjustly on others.	2003-08-25

I literally had tears running down my face while reading it, although the documented failures by the Bush administration pre-9/11 will make you cringe at what `might have been' had a competent administration been in place rather than the group of vacuous ideologues who were fixated on Iraq.<br />You need not be politically active to enjoy this book, or like to watch C-Span.  This book concisely presents well-documented fact in an amusing and engaging way to literally gut the right wing establishment for their (documented) lies.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will never vote for another lying Republican again. <br />Personally, I have watched in horror since the early 1980s as the press has ignored or repeated conservative lies with an uncritical eye, such as Bush's transparently false claims that the majority of his tax cuts would go to working class families.  It is somewhat sad that it takes a comedian to finally write a book that points out the lies and distortions of the right wing in this country, including the nuts who currently control the White House.  I have always wondered why the Democrats did not simply run commercials showing Republican lies juxtaposed next to the truth.  Franken finally does so, and does it in a compelling and funny way that will keep readers engaged.<br />Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and other talk-show liars of their ilk should close up shop after the compelling job Franken does destroying each of them.  Their credibility, if they ever had any, is non-existent.  Also, I have never seen a better critique (in any format) of the Bush administration's failings pre-9/11 as compared to the efforts begun by Clinton and handed off at the end of his term.<br />Buy this book.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-08-25

He also challenges Bush on many of his policies, including pre-9/11 awareness (in a fantastic chapter called &quot;Operation Ignore&quot;) and environmental regulations.

Having finished it rather early, I figure it might be helpful to give the first impression of the book.<br />If we can assume that the messages in \\"Stupid White Men\\" were as well-received as the book's sales would indicate, this book should do well.  It is 4 times the book that Moore's was.  It has more depth, more insight, more biting humor and overall more weight.  <br />The early chapters are essentially a refutation of Coulter, Goldberg, O'Reilly, et. al.  Franken uses good, solid evidence to refute the wishy-washy claims made by them, all the while infusing the whole thing with a healthy dose of on-topic humor.  Particularly funny is a section on Coulter: \\"How to Lie With Footnotes.\\"  I cannot wait to hear the right's refutation of this book, because Franken has done detailed research, and has a firm base to stand on.  Eric Alterman's book \\"What Liberal Media\\" is obviously the basis of this portion of the book.  Just to give you an idea of the tone, Franken uses the phrase \\"HANNITY AND colmes\\" to describe everyone's favorite diametrically opposed duo.<br />The next sections deal with several subjects the right took and ran with in the past couple of years: The 2000 election, the Wellstone memorial, the change in tone of politics.  A highly informative chapter describes Clinton's attempts to reinforce anti-terrorism, which were ignored by the Bush administration.  Another chapter describes how Clinton built up the military, and how many of the successful weapons and strategies used in Afghanistan and Iraq were developed at the behest of the Clinton Administration (Roger included!)<br />Interlaced throughout are narratives about Franken's personal experiences, whether it be confronting the Fox News table at a White House Correspondent's dinner or taking an intern on a ruse of a campus visit to Bob Jones which abruptly ends when Franken attempts a photo of himself hanging on a cross.  There are also countless transcripts of conversations Franken has had with all of these people, usually involving him making a phone call about a particular piece of evidence or misquote.  Don't we wish we all had the connections to pick up the phone and call Sean Hannity after a particularly crude episode?!<br />I have two complaints- first is that this book is being billed as a \\"humor\\" book.  Moore's book is in the Social Sciences section, and this book is much more serious and weighty.  More importantly, however, is Franken's use of completely fabricated, often sexual scenarios.  They all end with a footnote or asterisk or a \\"just kidding\\", but they only serve to cheapen the book.  Franken is a very funny man, and his \\"on-topic\\" humor is vastly superior to some of the trash he has thrown in.  How this got by his editor, I do not know.  These instances probably amount to no more than a page of text, which is far less than the trash in a typical O'Reilly or Coulter book.  And one of them is based on an actual excerpt from O'Reilly's novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" which is pulp romance porn at its worst.  So this is a mild complaint.<br />Yet, I am withholding a perfect five because of these parts.  I suggest to Mr. Franken that he reconsider pulling them from the paperback edition and move the book to the social sciences section.  It's really that good of a book, and it deserves to lose the downgrade in respectability associated with the classification. Oh, and that he contact me next time he's in Hilton Head.	2003-08-25

If, however, your political views are from the center or anywhere right of center, you'll view this as the ramblings of someone who couldn't make it in television or the movies, but found that he could make a buck by hurling insults at people who are far smarter than he is.

As he did 8 years ago in his first book, he has cut through a whole lot of clutter and presented undeniable truths that fly in the face of the myths we're being conditioned to believe.<br />We Americans have been lied to and manipulated by a media whose biases are not \\"liberal\\", they are more self-interested and corporate in nature.  Think about this point for example - George Bush told a bald-faced lie during the 2000 Campaign as to whether he'd been arrested since 1968.  He got away with it!  The so-called \\"liberal media\\" let him get away with this whopper.  You probably wouldn't hire somebody as a grocery clerk who lied to you about whether he'd been arrested or not.  We ended up electing this guy (sort of, anyway) President.<br />Franken has done us all a great service by collecting so many obscured but undeniable truths into one book.  Also, it's funny.  From the gentle humor of \\"Supply Side Jesus\\" to the extremely biting next chapter of \\"Operation Chickenhawk\\", it's very very funny for the most part.  Though occasionally Franken's jokes go flat - he is a man who could use some help editing himself.<br />He's also the greatest political satirist this nation's seen though and this book is MUST READ if you care about America and/or care about the truth.	2003-08-25

When he entered the political-punditry arena, I cheered like a cheerleader. Because I knew that his brand of comedy was truly a no-holds-barred affair, as opposed to others who've sleekly embraced that notion without ever really practicing it. \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big, Fat Idiot\\" was perfect for its time, when the titular powder keg of cellulite and half-digested balogna and his equally immense Republican brethren gleefully dug their mud-caked snouts into the Clinton administration, squealing with innuendo and sweat-drenched, cottage-cheese-thighed delight. And now, in a time when Shrill O'Lielly, Sham Hammity and P-Diddy Colmes, and Ann Colt-face have the ear of the public with their bestselling toilets of half-baked and lie-based accusations, we need the angry Franken more than ever to tell it like it is.<br />And man, does he.

He presents, with typical sardonicism and atypical rage, the foibles of the visible Right in United States politics, with a specific focus on the media and a more specific focus on Fox News, the Washington Times, and the Wall Street Journal's editoral page, in descending order.<br />He devotes two chapters (as well as many asides in other chapters) to current Conservative flamethrower Ann Coulter.  His other major whipping boys are Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.  He points out many instances where this trifecta of Conservative punditry have told out and out lies, lies of inference, and lies of obfuscation.  He documents these claims rather well, at least so far as my cursory check of his references seems to indicate.  Should I find that his documentation of his claims, which occurs mostly in the \\"Sources and Notes\\" section at the end of the book, is faulty, I will glady retract this review and remove the appropriate number of stars based on the egregiousness of the error.<br />I don't always agree with Mr. Franken's politics, but he always presents his case with humor and with evidence to back his position.  For example, he makes a good case against the repeal of estate taxes.   As he points out, just over half (56%) of most income that would have been taxed under estate taxes was from capital gains that were never actualized in hard currency and thus were never taxed in the first place.  Thus, per Mr. Franken, the claim that estate taxes are \\"double taxation\\" is bogus.  He also points out that the Feingold amendment would have allowed up to $100 million before estate taxes kicked in at all, protecting all but the ultra elite.  He never makes the connection that, at that level of income, it is highly likely that the majority of that $100 million + is from unactualized capital gains, though, which surprised me.  Perhaps he was leery of making such a statement without data to back it up, or perhaps he didn't believe the connection needed to be explicit given how obvious it appears to be (at least to me).<br />In any event, he did convince me that the Feingold amendment would have been a good thing, but he did not convince me that the estate tax itself as it existed (and to some extent still exists until 2010) was a good thing.  I will not elaborate here on my defense of the issue - this is a review of Mr. Franken's book, his opinions, and how that book affected me.  A diatribe on my views on this subject except in how the book influenced them would be out of place.<br />The reason for the four instead of five star rating:  I think he may have crossed the line in two sections.  Were he purely a humorist, neither would raise my eyebrow, but as he is a political commentator/humorist, they left a bad taste in my mouth.  My first issue is with \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode I\\".  I found it hilarious, but also somewhat nauseating.  Yes, the gentlemen he includes in his cast of chickenhawks all promote war without having served.  He also plays up the notable \\"character flaws\\" of the various characters.  As a comic, it's hilarious.  As a political commentator decrying the \\"tone\\" of current discourse, it's the moral equivalent of the \\"triple bank shot\\" he accuses Coulter of performing.  <br />The other issue was the Waitress/Lawyer one-act play.  My issue there is not with his facts, but with dramatic necessity.  A lawyer who would take that much time and effort and empathy to explain the situation to Donna would not also then cheer for Bush.  She'd admit that she got the better of the deal, but she wouldn't say \\"I love Bush!\\".  Were she the \\"Bush Lover\\", she'd have simply let the comment about the 100% tax cut slide and enjoyed her dinner.  Basically, she claimed to be a neocon at the end, but acted like a guily-rich liberal up until that point.<br />Otherwise, I quite enjoyed the read.  I even learned a few things I did not know before.  I spent a few hours tonight reviewing the stated references and Icannot yet find a lie of omission or commission.  Of course, it's a book, not a post on a webfourm, and I can't claim to have researched everything TeamFranken did over the course of writing it in an evening.  Generally, though, a spot check of 20 or so references will reveal one that's flawed if the intent of the references is to deceive.  I found zero.<br />The Right needs an Al Franken.  They need someone with humor *and* a distaste for lies - of commission or omission.  Reading the current Right pundits and Franken... well, if I were Liberal or Conservative, I'd rather have one Al Franken than 100 Ann Coulters.<br />(Caveat:  I am not claiming Independent.  My views tend to line up about 65% with \\"liberal\\" and 35% with \\"conservative\\".  There might be a slight bias by myself towards Mr. Franken and against Ms. Coulter.  Please take that into account when using this review to affect your purchase.)	2003-08-25

Look at W's record and it's one of Mission NOT Accomplished: No WMD found, the worst economy in 20 years, the highest unemployment, Iraq & Afghanistan are endless killing quagmires. And whenever W opens his mouth it's clear that he's tirelessly fighting to liberate our language from the cruel contraints of grammar and logic. <br />Also recommended: \\"Speaking of Sex: Funny, Wicked & Joyful Remarks About Almost Everybody's Favorite Subject\\" by John-Paul Sousa.

My husband and I bought \\"Lies\\" early yesterday early and began reading it aloud to pass time during a long car-ride to our cabin.  Only one thing that annoyed me about the book:  ultimately, it pretty much ruined our last weekend at the cabin because we couldn't put it down.  Rather than boating, swimming, fishing, and just enjoying one last Minnesota summer weekend, we spent most of our time reading or trying to con the other person into putting \\"Lies\\" down in order to snatch it up.<br />Expecting to be entertained (and we weren't let down), we were also astonished by how remarkably well Al and his \\"TeamFranken\\" researched this piece.  Franken does a brilliant job of debunking the myths and \\"outing\\" the right-wing nut-job liars who fill our airwaves with so much [stuff].  We especially loved the chapter on Bill O'Reilly (we saw the CSPAN BookExpo thing live) and were delighted to re-live the taking down of one of the nastiest, most offensive bullies on cable. <br />And of course, as Minnesotans, the chapter dealing with the Wellstone memorial was something we've been waiting for SOMEONE to write. Franken puts the jokes on the back-burner and is incredibly insightful, honest, and moving.         <br />What I want to see, now, is for Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilley,and Sean Hannity to even TRY to refute Franken's taking-you-apart.  You can't do it, because he's right, you lied and you were all caught and I suppose you'll all try to claim you haven't read the book because you CAN'T refute the fact that you lied. <br />As far as the next book goes, whose draft title I don't dare type lest my 8 year old walks in, we can't wait for it.	2003-08-24

This does not mean that Franken is agenda-free...far from it!  But his agenda is to expose the New Right media for the sham that it is; to deliver a counter punch in the 24-7 assualt on liberal ideology from the Right. Using a powerful combination of data, humor, and instinct, Franken delivers a knockout!<br />With this book, the right wing media is exposed for what it really is, and the emperor has no clothes...	2003-08-24

It also details the blatant hypocracy of these conservative loonies, and of the GOP in general.

Franken capably undermines much of the myth of the &quot;liberal media&quot; and takes on people like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter.  There is a hilarious encounter with Barbara Bush and some wonderful fictional satire dealing with the GOP and military service, and the blurring of capitalism and Christianity.  <br />This book is angrier than the Limbaugh one, however, and at times Franken loses his cool.  He is personally offended by the treatment of the Wellstone memorial service and also with the arrogance of this administration.  Hard to argue with him on either, but the book at times loses its wonderful humorous edge.  That is his strength.  <br />I think this book should be read.  It is unapologetically liberal and makes no pretense at anything else.  But he researches his sources.  You may quibble with his conclusions, but he isn't making this stuff up (unlike Coulter and Hannity).  All he is asking is a critical look at what Fox News and this administration are selling.  Seems like a reasonable request to me.	2003-08-24

This book, with its \\"skewering of right-wing-skewing personalities\\" is Franken's best work since \\"Why Not Me?\\" As an author (\\"The Couple's Disease: Finding a Cure for Your 'Lost' Love Life\\", also available on Amazon!), I especially appreciate Franken's dry wit and wonderful ability to make his arguments clearly, concisely and extremely enjoyable to read. While most people either love him or can't stand him, his writing is always entertaining and often hilarious, and certainly makes you think about the world we live in and the personalities we listen to!<br />Whether you're on the right or the left (...mainly those of you on the left), this extremely humorous PARODY will open up your eyes and hopefully, your minds to the various sides of the issues...I'm sure that in a million years, Franken never (?) anticipated the huge controversy surrounding the book's title \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\\". But Franken (and his Publisher) are probably thanking their lucky stars for the huge amounts of free publicity afforded them by Fox News and Bill O'Reilly. However, I think that WE, the audience, are the biggest winners, since many more millions of people who may never have heard of Franken's comic genius before are now certainly aware of this book and hopefully will order it for themselves. Interestingly, some of Franken's funniest lines came after the book was already written, when an injunction was sought to stop the publication of the book on the basis of \\"copyright infringement\\" for the use of the words 'fair and balanced' in the title. After the judge ruled in Franken's favor, he stated that \\"In addition to thanking my own lawyers, I'd like to thank Fox's lawyers for filing one of the stupidest briefs I've ever seen in my life.\\" ...classic Al! As for his critics, all I can say is LIGHTEN UP!...and, in the words of another great American writer and thinker, Mr. Bill O'Reilly, we can just \\"let the viewers (readers) decide for themselves\\".	2003-08-24

No seriously, they did. And they lost, real quickly too.<br />This is Franken in his usual professional, and yes, liberal form.  The media is not liberally biased, atleast on the things that count.  Franken shows this, but more importantly confronts those liars of the Right, that seem to be willing to say anything to appear victorious in their &quot;debates.&quot;  From O'Reilly to Hannity to Coulter, Franken one by one takes on the actual words, which would be better described as lies, from their programs, webpages, or &quot;books&quot;.  Using real research by his top ranked &quot;TeamFranken&quot; (including &quot;the Bens&quot;), these lies are not only exposed, but the deceptions are shown to be obviously intentional on the parts of the lying liars.<br />All the while, Franken's wit and humor to go alongside this confrontation of the Right is top class.  While this book is a comedy, it is also a commentary that reviews those who claim to be trustworthy and balanced or independant, but are nonetheless vile mudslingers, content on reporting their own biased and ignorant opinions rather than covering the news.  <br />This book is a must have.	2003-08-24

Statistics seem wrong, reasoning seems skewed, emotions and reactions are out of line with content... Ann Coulter is praising Joseph McCarthy, the Alabama supreme court is telling me that the 10 Commandments are not religious, the weapons are THERE, we just haven't found them, Bill O'Reilly would have us believe Inside Edition won two Peabody awards... I always wished someone would force the truth, do the fact checking, trust my intelligence to balance an opinion based only on fact. Well, someone finally does, and it turns out to be a comedian, with an ace research staff. This book uncovers everything that bugs you about the laziness of cable news, everything from Ann Coulter's real age to the stupidest Wall Street Journal editorial ever printed. It unspins the Paul Wellstone memorial service (a nasty bit of news misrepresentation), and calls on O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Falwell, Hannity, and many other notable bullies to back up their statements, which they can't. And - despite Fox News characterizing Al Franken as \\"unfunny\\" - it is hilarious. It is also calm, matter-of-fact, satirical, ironic, well-researched, and lets the reader decide, based on an honest presentation. A privilege that Fox News does not give me. Speaking of which, here are two things that resulted from the Fox News lawsuit against Al Franken: I bought this book (which I probably wouldn't have, otherwise), and I stopped watching Fox News.	2003-08-24

Social-political discourse with a rapier wit. I would have laughed until something exploded if the right-wing wasn't so horrifyingly chilling in their historical amnesia and selective 'truths.' Look at the current trends, 'You aren't an American if you think x and y. You're a traitor.' ug. These first few years of the millennium are decidedly marked by a polarized America that can't seem to find any kind of middle ground - in anything... and it's a decade marred by people who exhibit the 'Do as I say, not as I do\\" commandment.<br /><br />Franken pokes the eyes of those 'lying liars' of media hogs and politicos, laying down the facts and setting the record straight. Special attention paid to his old pal, and liar-extraordinaire O'Reilly plus others of the same low-life caliber (*cough* Is Anne Coulter for real?)  Fun and irreverent, well researched, he finds no problem with lambasting the abundant misdeeds and duplicity of those purporting to give a 'fair and balanced' view of the world - the world they seem to have constructed out of thin air and with very little basis in this world at all. It's a heady topic but much is here - memorials into democrat clubbing to further their hate campaign, the Bush administration and its tap dance around the truth, political bias in certain 'news programs' (*cough*), and a holy host of others.<br /><br />A good gift for your beloved truth-seeker, and a necessity present for your misguided right-winger.	2003-08-24

It's actually very funny, but it's a necessarily dark humor. People are cynically lying to you every day about matters of life and death and the nation's future, which is difficult to lighten too much.<br />Franken succeeds in his effort, and make his case strongly.

It is loaded with a lot of information that most of us overlook or bypass when getting the news.  Al Franken is a sharp detective of what just doesn't pass the litmus test for truth, and goes after it and bears the burden of proof without making anything up to promote his agenda.<br />Besides being politically astute, Al Franken is definitely more funny than Ann Coulter.	2003-08-24

With an embarrassing wealth of factual examples to draw from, I think he finally got tired and depressed.

People may not like what he has to say or how he says it, but detractors will have a hard time proving anything he says is untrue.  Except when he lies.

Al Franken's new book is a humorous and entertaining slap in the face to the Right that has been long overdue. Like Joe Conason, the author of \\"Big Lies\\", Al Franken is a rarity: a liberal who is allowed on television from time to time and who, when attacked by right-wingers, actually fights back!<br />For many years \\"the Left\\" has been represented on TV by:<br />(A) people who aren't really left of center: Al Hunt, Tom Braden, Mark Shields, Sam Donaldson, Ellis Hennican<br />(B) people who are so annoying that even those who agree with them can't stand to watch or listen: Eleanor Clift, Susan Estrich<br />(C) weenies who sit meekly and allow the right-winger on the show to whack them like pinatas: Bill Press, OR<br />(D) a combination on \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\": Alan Colmes<br />Franken makes the clever comparison of the \\"HANNITY and colmes\\" show to a game between the Harlem Globetrotters and the Washington Generals. The analogy is right on target since like the Generals, alan colmes is a patsy who is simply there to be humiliated by his opponent time and again. This is not surprising since FOX News is run by a Republican stooge named Roger Ailes, who like Vince McMahon of pro wrestling fame, makes sure every bout is 100% fixed and that no one will call his right-wing hacks on their numerous lies. This is where Al Franken comes in.<br />A few months ago, at a book expo, Al Franken confronted Bill O'Reilly of FOX News about how O'Reilly had falsley claimed to have won two Peabody awards he had never won. As Franken recounts in his book (and many saw on C-SPAN), when caught in a lie, Bill O'Reilly started screaming \\"shut up\\" and called Franken an \\"idiot\\". O'Reilly isn't the only charlatan on FOX News. Franken exposes Sean Hannity as well. No wonder FOX News filed (and lost) a nuisance suit that was filed for the sole purpose of suppressing a book that exposed FOX News as collection of liars, demagogues and hucksters -and ridiculed them as well! The tough-talkers on FOX candish it out but they sure can't take it.<br />It's not just FOX that gets a long overdue drubbing. Ann \\"thrax\\" Coulter gets some comeuppance, too. I could go on, but there are so many right-wing lies exposed in \\"Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair And Balanced Look At The Right\\", that I couldn't do Franken's work justice.

More importantly, it is written in so accessible a manner as to be an invaluable tool for the vast majority of Americans who don't go to sleep each night thinking about how loathsome Sean Hannity really is.  <br />This book demolishes (again!) the myth of the liberal media, and it does it in a very simple manner.  There are enough facts, examples, and sources to make Franken's argument compelling, but it isn't so comprehensive as to be off-putting to the casual observer of politics/media.  The book is not a painstaking and methodical refutation of the liberal media myth, as was Eric Alterman's brilliant &quot;What Liberal Media?&quot;.  Rather, it's a flip and funny takedown of the right-wing media machine.  <br />The achievement of the book is that it doesn't use its humor to avoid the hard work of making a strong case.  Rather, it uses humor as the sugar to make the pill (rigorous and well-researched political argument) go down easier.  The research is in there, and the arguments are tight.  But the book isn't intended to be comprehensive or authoritative.  On each of Franken's topics (including Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Rove/Cheney/Bush, etc.), Franken presents a paradigmatic example (or two, or three) of their propensity for telling outright lies.  He infuses this point with truck loads of biting and acerbic humor.  But he's not simply an attack dog.  Like any good comedian, his goal is to produce laughs.  He's as likely to send you into paroxysms of helpless merriment with a smart defense of Gore's supposed lies as he is with a wicked smackdown of one of the right's more odious talking heads.  <br />The book is smart, funny, clever, sharp, andright on target.  If you're not already a zombified disciple of conservative political &quot;thought&quot;, then reading this book will prevent you from ever becoming one.	2003-08-24

Not only will you learn that her much-bragged-about fetish for footnotes (that allegedly prove she's telling the truth about everything) is just plain nonsense, but you'll probably double over laughing as Franken rips her arguments into tatters.<br />And then there's the Super Liar, O'Reilly.  I previously hadn't been aware that the supposedly \\"independent\\" O'Reilly is actually registered as a Republican.  Not a surprise, but just the tip of the iceberg in O'Reilly's river of Titanic fibs.<br />Sean Hannity?  His lies about Reagan's budgetary policies are dismissed with ease (and humor), not to mention his whoppers about Democrats and terrorism.  Franken's analysis of Hannity's obsession with gays made me laugh until my ribs hurt.<br />Speaking of terrorism, Franken's book makes a compelling case for what he calls the Bush program of \\"Operation Ignore,\\" which was what the administration was doing on terrorism prior to September 11.<br />What some might simply dismiss as the work of a funny guy (or, if you work for - or preach the gospel of - Fox News, an \\"unfunny\\" guy) actually provides an extremely comprehensive overview of the Bush administration's approach to terrorism in the pre-and post-September 11th world.  <br />It is not flattering, and frankly, often embarrassing... and hence something that the supposedly liberal media has only touched on lightly.  It also perfectly explains why the Bush administration has ducked and weaved its way around thorough investigations of the intelligence and policy failures that culminated on September 11th.<br />And when you consider that even Paul Bremer (now running the \\"51st State of Iraq\\") can be accurately cited by Franken for pointing out that the Clinton administration was \\"correctly focused on bin Laden,\\" it makes it obvious that people like Coulter are just pimps for an administration that wants to shift the blame anywhere but at themselves.  It's not surprising, then, that they've chosen to do what comes oh-so naturally for conservatives... blame Clinton.<br />In case you were wondering, Franken knocks this \\"Blame Clinton\\" tactic out of the park.<br />Is Franken \\"Fair and Balanced?\\"  A heck of a lot more than Fox News will ever dream of being.  And a lot more perceptive and thorough than the mainstream media<br />Is he funny?  Unless you're making millions by writing books targeted to conservatives or appearing as the host of a Fox talk show, you'd have to be dead not to find this an amusing (and extremely informative) read.<br />And for you conservative book-buyers, if you would like to find out how you're being robbed blind by \\"authors\\" like Hannity and Coulter, buy this book right away.  <br />Enjoy.<br />(And for those who would like to read further, Eric Alterman's \\"What Liberal Media\\" is simply great writing... thorough, well-researched, insightful... all the things that people like Hannity and Coulter claim to be... but aren't.)	2003-08-24

Kudos to Al and to Joe, I recommended this book not just to the faithful, but also to the ditto heads, the faux followers the angry who lap up the half-truths, the self-serving platitudes and the empty suits, all without question.

What I expected was a vitriolic diatribe assailing some of the leading propagandists of the right.   Instead Al Franken has written a heartfelt book which is much more funny and insightful than I expected.   Most surprising to me was how callous the rightists were in creating their lies and how fearful they were of people discovering that those lies were mostly fabricated on purpose.    If this book is any indication of the true motives of those seeking to create a new Nazi party here in America, I already know they will supply Al with more than enough material for a sequel \\"More Lies from the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.\\"  Thank you Al (and Team) for a great rollicking read.	2003-08-23

TeamFranken does an excellent job of exposing the rabid right-wing media zealots. Among his exposes are the revelation that Bill O'Reilly lied about his Peabody Awards (his claim, two awards; Peabody says none), Coulter's lies about the New York Times (She claims that elitist biasled them not to cover important stories, Team Franken proves her wrong) and Bush, Cheney, Rove, and Wolfowitz, and Ashcroft's lies about nearly everything. (see pages 1-379)<br />I wanted to be the first to review this book, so I could prepare you for what will inevitably follow.  Somewhere on this very page, someone will refer to Al Franken as untalented, call him \\"Al Qaeda\\" and compare him to other slackers like James Carville, Mario Cuomo, and Franklin Delanor Roosevelt.  Another review will say that his brand of unfunny leftist humor is shrill and spiteful (unlike Rush Limbaugh's joke about calling a 13 year old Chelsea Clinton a dog.)  And yet another will tell you that although he is a liberal, he is ashamed at the rhetoric in this book and will never vote for a Democrat again (To this I can only say, shame on you Senator Lieberman.)  Take these reviews with a grain of salt, because they will be written by bitter, angry men who have never brought a woman to orgasm. To TeamFranken, I offer a hearty salute, and the sincere hope that we can get the lying liars out of office.	2003-08-23

A lot of the content involves factchecking, which on its own, could be pretty dry. Fortunately, the Franken wit makes it entertaining as well as educational. <br />Read the truth behind some of your favorite right wing LIES. Clinton did NOT allow 9/11 to happen due to inaction. Al Gore did NOT claim to invent the internet, nor did he claim he and Tipper were the basis for &quot;Love Story.&quot; And most all, read about the lying liars such as Sean Hannity, Bill O'Rielly, Ann Coulter (that girl ain't right) and many more. And woven through the book (so far) are examples showing why George W. Bush may well end up being the worst, most deceitful president in our nation's history.<br />Thanks to copious notes and thorough research, Franken's book is a lot more &quot;solidly built&quot; than Michael Moore's &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; or &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; but every bit as engaging. And it illustrates just how the right-wing arguments are truly &quot;paper thin.&quot;	2003-08-23

It's funny, easy to read, hiply literate and well-researched. For all of us who have watched the right-wing pundrity over the years get away with the most outrageous deceptions while affecting a smug, holier than thou attitude, here at last is relief. <br />With great restraint, Franken makes fair and balanced precision attacks on the bloviators of the right. He slays the evil Ann Coulter on the merit (or, rather, lack of merit) of her work, never once referring to her drunken pub-crawling described by David Brock. He eviscerates Rush Limbaugh, as always, never even appealing to those rumors that he was once arrested for toilet-sex. He flays Bill O'Reilly without ever questioninq what he was doing hanging around in all those discotheques that he claims he frequented up till the time he married at a late age. And he reveals President Bush's meanness without ever mentioning claims that he paid for a girl-friend's abortion in his younger days. <br />The first two-thirds of the book are hilarious. After that, it less funny but equally informative and readable. <br />Most importantly, in addition to all the fun that it makes out of deflating right-wing gas bags, there are serious political points about issues that affect our material and spiritual well-being.

Let me put this in very simple terms:  anyone who is conservative will hate this book, anyone who is a moderate, independent, or leftist will likely love it.  As in RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT, Franken has written a political satire in which he combines a variety of techniques to make fun of the Right in the United States.  Sometimes this means using the same negative tactics mastered by the Right.  Frequently this involves adding a few facts some Right wing pundit conveniently left out.  Constantly this involves humor.<br />For a humorous satire, the book contains a great deal of factual content, and should serve a valuable service in getting many American's to question many of the assertions of the Right, whose record in handling facts has been pretty dismal for quite some time (many on the Right complain that those on the Left keep calling them dumb and stupid, but they never seem to grasp that one of the major reasons for this is their persistent inability to \\"get the facts straight\\"-yes, facts do matter, and failing to get them right will result in others thinking you less than brilliant).  Franken wrote this book in the context of teaching a course at Harvard, and he is very clear that he used the fourteen student members of his seminar as research assistants and fact checkers.  In other words, Franken's book will not be guilty of the hundreds (literally) of factual errors of Ann Coulter's books, for instance.  Many who have followed closely political events of the past decade will not be surprised by many of the things in the book, but his presentation is always fresh and full of insight.<br />This is a funny, funny book, though I'm sure fans of his targets won't agree.  Franken has long been one of the funniest men in America.  It certainly wasn't an accident that during all the good years of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, Franken was crucially involved as writer.  Not every part of the book succeeds equally for me.  I'm sure some will enjoy the fictional account &quot;Operation Chickenhawk,&quot; in which the host of high profile Right wingers who never served in the military embark on a military mission, but I'm afraid I did not (the similar chapter in RUSH LIMBAUGH IS A BIG FAT IDIOT was my least favorite in that book).  As a Christian, however, I really, really loved the cartoon chapter &quot;The Gospel According to Supply Side Jesus.&quot;  As someone who has been horrified at the gigantic gap between the teachings and example of Jesus in the Gospels (and especially in Luke-Acts), it was great to see a vivid depiction of the kind of Jesus implied by the politics of the Right.<br />Not all parts are funny, nor were meant to be.  Al Franken knew and obviously loved Paul Wellstone, and he is obviously angry for the bizarre way that the Right Wing pundits distorted what actually happened at the now infamous Wellstone memorial, which Franken attended.<br />This is not the best book available on the struggles the Right has with the truth.  That title would go to Eric Alterman's WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? or Joe Conason's new BIG LIES.  But Franken's book is definitely the funniest political book of recent years.

Mr. Franken takes no prisoners, and skewers his subjects with outrageous -- but absolutely accurate -- assertions about their dishonesty.  He and his (serious) researchers uncover and explain the facts that unravel the many political lies that have been reported in the media over and over again in the past decade, and most recently, since 2000.  Readers can do their own detective work and hold Franken to his own avowed standards of truth, and you'll find he can back up everything he says.  Try this book.  You may not like it, but you won't be able to shrug it off.	2003-08-23

I got home about an hour ago and sitting on the front porch was my copy of Al Franken's book. I am only 20 pages into it so far, but I must say right off the bat that Al does even a better job here than he did in his 1996 opus Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, which I happen to think is one of the funniest and most insightful books I have ever read. <br />Here's what has happened in the book so far: A forward about what got him to write this book, some pages about writing the book, a few more pages thanking his researchers - it is actually funny stuff!<br />Then comes the first of his targets: Ann Coulter. It takes him all of 1/2 page to thoroughly destroy her and her \\"research\\". But he does not stop at that. He goes on for at least (I am only 20 pages into the book for cryin' out loud!) 15 more pages and 3 chapters describing what a sad little woman this Coulter character and her pathetic research is. <br />Would I buy this book again? Well, I loved RLIABFI, so YES!  I would buy it again! As a matter of fact I will probably do that a few times this year to hand out as gifts. <br />I plan on making a lot of Republicans really happy this holiday season.	2003-08-23

Al Franken is back in form and better than ever! Franken's Views of the crass, and belligerent journalistic Styles of the likes of Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter deserve high praise. But what makes the work a true gem of modern literature is Franken's humorous way of revealing the shortcomings of right-wing economic theory in simple terms (See the Chapter &quot;Supply-Side Jesus&quot; the Chronicle of a holy figure that won't cure Lepers because that would only encourage others to contract leprosy), while pointing out the hypocrisy of the Right-wing pundits. While Ann Coulter complains that mature political debate is lost in America, she refers to Katie Couric as &quot;An Airhead&quot;. Franken points out that Coulter writing style suggests her belief that &quot;The rules don't apply to her&quot;<br />&quot;Lies&quot; is a telling look at the right-wing propaganda/hype the American public has been over-exposed to since Bush took The Oval Office. The loss of absence of malice in right-wing journalism, and the underhanded political tactics used to suppress the truth, as well as smear those who disagree with the policies of the President.<br />Lastly &quot;Lies&quot; discusses the actual concept lost since 2001, The fact that We are guaranteed free speech in the United States, and that disagreeing with executive policy, is they way we love America as adults - by looking at her with the eyes of reason as well as passion. It reminds us that questioning our leaders is a responsibility we all have. We are warned not to blindly follow our leaders in the name of patriotism. We must be ever vigilant and mindful of our freedoms and take care of each other as fellow Americans. Above all it reminds us that the Republican Party does not have a monopoly on Patriotism. For that reason above all, I recommend &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;	2003-08-22

First a quick review of the first five chapters. <br />Chapter One...Could be put in the introduction. <br />Chapter Two...Great part about Ann Coulter and her numerous footnotes, which are actually endnotes and the six ways she misrepresents or outright lies about what was written about it. <br />Chapter Three...Great neo-fascist quotes from Coulter.<BR>After 9/11, \\"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity.\\" <br />Joking with a reporter, \\"My only regret with Timothy McVeigh is he did not go to The New York Times building.\\" <br />Chapter Four...Yes liberals hate America. If they disagree with any republican they are dismissed as being unpatriotic. Quick compare and contrast LBJ, John Glenn, and Truman vs. Reagan, Bush Jr., and Dan Quail. Some slight differences in military records yet we (liberals) try not to call them unpatriotic.  <br />Chapter Five...This chapter and the BJU (Bob Jones University) really aren't needed for a serious political book but I'll give it a few chuckles. <br />Conservatives and Centrists have always wondered where the absolute hatred of the Bush administration comes from...this book compellingly answers it in spades. Conservatives are becoming spin masters faster than liberals are. Such as Gore \\"invented\\" the internet, Rush, O'Reilly, and Hannity went nuts, but was Gore ever quoted as saying, \\"inventing the internet.\\" NO! He did what any senator would do and passed bills funding Arpanet, the emergency military computer network. He \\"took the initiative in creating it (internet)\\". <br />O'Reilly you're a sad man for lying where you come from...and even sadder that you would threaten to shoot Franken after your confrontation with him on C-Span. Oh yeah you're also a registered independent. <br />Karl Rove that was a really inventive trick you did in the Texas back in 1986. Plant a bug in your office the morning before the gubernatorial debates then call a press conference (not the police) about what you found (planted). Push poll in the South Carolina primary so people won't vote for McCain (someone I would vote for). <br />Hannity what are your qualifications for being on TV? No degree...background in construction. You're hired.    <br />Franken also takes on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, which are soft targets of the far right. It also surprised me how many LAZY journalists commented on Wellstone's memorial service. Hardly any of them saw the entire three-hour event so what gives them the right to criticize it? Rush's criticism was more outright lies. \\"Clinton bused the crowd in.\\" <br />The funny parts were a nice breather...Supply-side Jesus was great, next to operation Chickenhawk.<br />In conclusion, I encourage both liberals and conservatives to read this book and I challenge them to find misrepresentations, deceptions, or lies besides the obvious humor.	2003-08-22

The lies repeatedly spewed by Coulter, O'Reilly and the Fox News ilk (shamelessly headed by Aussie Rupert Murdoch and right-winger Roger Ailes) should be ridiculed and shamed, not bought into blindly.

A friend of mine purchased Al's book (I never would have myself), I thought he was crazy for doing so in the first place, and even crazier after I read it. I was so tempted to see if I could some how figure out where Al is coming from with his point of view, as I tried to keep an open mind. After reading it here are my findings:<br />1. First off I think it is supposed to be one big SNL comedy sketch, because everything he says is a joke (by joke I don't mean funny, but insane.)<br />2. He rips everyone from Fox news, to President Bush, to conservatives in general, without a hint of proof behind anything he says. IMO.<br />3. This book is 100% directed at ripping anyone with common sense morals, and a common sense mindset. I really got the feeling that he is so upset that there has been this backlash against the liberal movement in this country, that he tries and tries again to pull the wool over the eyes of readers with tales only a Sadaam loyalist could come up with. Sorry Al, despite what you think, there are still quite a few educated and intelligent people out here.<br />IMO it's a waste, but I had to see if I could some how some way look at any of his views and see if maybe he could put some legitimate logic behind it... I got nothing.<br />This book all in all, truly frightened me, from the point of view that there really are people out there that think this way.<br />As a side note; I am a registered independent if that makes any difference.<br />Jason	2003-08-22

Utilizing a staff of Harvard research assistants, Franken systematically calls into question the validity of most, if not all, of what some right-wing pundits espouse as fact.  Furthermore, he puts into question the entire notion of a \\"liberal media\\", one of the Right's pet accusations.  If you are sick of listening to fascist blonds tell you that social injustice doesn't exist or Republicans calling themselves \\"independent\\", read Franken's book.  Peace.	2003-08-22

I consider myself a vehement independent (and am actually registered as such, unlike Bill O'Reilly), and usually look down upon such overtly partisan books such as this...BUT, Al Franken is a darn funny guy. He systematically dismantles his main \\"opponents\\" on the right, namely Ann Coulter, Bernie Goldberg, Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and the current White House administration, with such wit and...wait for it...FACTS that I was left practically in tears at times.<br />First on his radar is Ann Coulter, who he calls a \\"nutcase\\" (subtly, as it is the title of chapter 2 - Ann Coulter: Nutcase). He dissects her best-selling book \\"Slander\\" and reveals countless blatant lies throughout her book, lies that any computer-literate person can expose in just a few minutes on google or LexisNexis. <br />His next target is Bernie Goldberg (after a second chapter dealing with Coulter). Goldberg's book \\"Bias\\" is revealed to be written using the most selective of sources to illustrate the alleged liberal bias in the media.<br />Franken moves on to the great Bill O'Reilly, who seems entirely incapable of telling the truth and has mastered the art of hypocrisy. My favorite of Franken's points in this chapter is his comparison of O'Reilly to the rap artist Ludacris, who was featured in a Pepsi ad that led O'Reilly to ask his viewers to boycott Pepsi. His reasoning: Ludacris \\"degrades women...encourages substance abuse, and does all the things that hurt particularly the poor in this country.\\" Franken then reads to us from O'Reilly's own novel \\"Those Who Trespass\\" (available here on amazon.com!), which is \\"about 'a serial killer who will exact revenge on everyone who has sabotaged his rising TV career.'\\" It features a 15 year-old crack whore performing fellatio and depicts more murders than does Ludacris' hit album \\"Word of Mouf\\". <br />Franken then goes after the Bush administration and the war on terror with the same fact-based wit-filled vengeance he used on his fellow authors. Thisbook is more truthful and a heckuva lot funnier than the rest (I know, unfortunately I've read many of them) and worthwhile reading no matter which side you're on. I fully expect a liberal/conservative amazon.com rating war to break out over this one, just as it did with all the others. I just hope a significant portion of the partisan raters actually read the book, especially those who would otherwise absentmindedly give it one star, and I challenge those one star raters to not laugh while reading this and to refute Franken's own refutations.	2003-08-22

First, Franken does not provide an indepth and insightful review of the issues.  Franken does not offer any keen solutions.  Rather, he writes a polemic that reads more like a raving mad speech from Hitler than a scientific, philosphical or political review.  Second, Franken relies on insult and name calling when referring to his political opponents.  The reader clearly can tell he not only disagrees with his political opponents but he also hates them, and this enrages his soul.  Finally, because the vast majority of his general topics are stated in platitudinal form and the vast majority of his particular comments ring of demogoguery rather than logical argument, Franken fails to present a persuasive argument.<br />In conclusion, this book fails to make any substantial or even trivial contribution to the liberal cause and for that reason I strongly recommend avoiding it.	2003-08-22

If conservatives such as Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly grow arrogant and fail to police themselves meticulously, they only make it that much easier for Franken, not to mention Michael Moore, to achieve credibility and outstanding sales numbers.  If everything Franken says is true, Coulter, O'Reilly, etc. are making it that much more difficult for the rest of the world to take seriously those of us activist Republicans who hold strong and genuine beliefs while toiling in obscurity.<br />This book just came out and inevitably will be debated.  Perhaps Ann Coulter will be able to defend herself against the examples Franken cites of her seem-impossible-to-have-been-accidental misleading &quot;footnotes&quot; in &quot;Slander.&quot;  At this point, that seems to me a far-fetched scenario.<br />I found this book quite funny at times (and probably would have found it even funnier if my politics were anywhere near left-of-center).  While not anywhere near the classic hysterics that Franken achieved in the gorilla scenes in &quot;Trading Places,&quot; the book did make me laugh out loud on a few occasions, more so than any other book I've read recently other than Jay Johnstone's &quot;Temporary Insanity.&quot;<br />My one major criticism is that the book seems inexplicably to spare David Horowitz, the hustling, hypocritical, hatred-consumed homunculus who right now is probably doing more to damage the credibility of the Right for the long term than any other pundit.	2003-08-21

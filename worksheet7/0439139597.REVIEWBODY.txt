The best Harry Potter so far  People actually die  Voldemt is a real threat now!
In reviewg the previous three Harry Potter books I neglected to mention that Harry never really got around to likg anybody  He was way too busy wh his schoolg  Quiddch to do much of anythg  Ftunately f us this changes  The Goblet of Fire but I'm gettg ahead of myself Startg from the begng Harry once aga fds himself at the Dursleys  whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr Weasley but not befe Gege sabotages Dudley wh his newly vented Ton-Tongue Toffee  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quiddch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts along wh preppy Beauxbatons  cold dferent Durmstrang will be participatg  the ultimate wizardg trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament Each school will have one representative  From Beauxbatons Fleur Delacour was chosen from Durmstrang Vikt Krum  from Hogwarts Cedric Diggy One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student to the Triwizard Tournament  Who?  Duh Harry   Throughout the three trials of the Tournament Harry learns to rely on his friends me than ever  He also is  f the shock of his le when he  Cedric are transpted to an open field where they wness a hrible deed: Ld Voldemt (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  You-Know-Who) has risen  is back  his body  Voldemt then kills Cedric (who is datg Cho Chang a Ravenclaw Quiddch player  secret love of Harry [yes he fally likes someone])  duels Harry  Who ws?  Duh Harry- but barely  The rest is just anticlimactic  thus not wthy of mentiong here Overall ratg: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban  one of Rowlg's best  100000/100
This is the fourth book  the series  the movie version will be comg out soon I just fished readg this book f the second  third time sce  first debuted  the sty holds up just as strongly  not even stronger this time I thk the tricacy of the plot gets lost on us fans  readers sometimes but Rowlg has superbly crafted the plot  deftly reveals the sty of Harry Potter  such a way that leaves us both satisfied  yet eagerly clamourg f me I cannot wa to fally read the "Half-Blood Prce"  then the long-awaed fal book  the series Ms Rowlg has left her delible imprt on both the lerary field  our culture as a whole  as both an adg fan  an envious fellow wrer I'm very glad I've  some small way been able to share  this magical taleIf you still haven't entered to this wld you should troduce yourself to Harry Potter now- Gregy Bernard Banks[]
The plot contues to be terestg  the latest stallment of the Harry Potter series  the characters beg to evolve  face me complex suations
This is a great book  the Harry Potter series Like most HP fans after readg this book I immediately read the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by auth Daniel Lawrence to ga even me sights  fmation on all the books  the series  the upcomg new GOF Movie 4 Highly recommend
I enjoyed the book very much It was a ltle sad  places But over all a very good read
In my opion Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is JK Rowlg's masterpiece It is my personal fave of all the six books It's longer has a fantastic plot  best ( wst?) of all a very unexpected endg that is just so suspenseful!It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts  there are some mysterious thgs gog on Oddly Harry ends up havg to participate  a new dangerous contest takg place at the school f which he's not even age-eligible How come Harry ended up  this perilous event  most imptantly what's the reason behd all these strange occurrences?JK Rowlg troduces us to a few new characters  the book a few new characters you'll defely love! The plot is simply wonderful  I believe the novel is extremely well-wrten Even though this book is slightly darker than the previous one 's still a great sty f all ages to enjoy especially Harry Potter fans!If you have read the previous Harry Potter books I guarantee you that you'll enjoy the fourth book very much It's also a simply fantastic base f the three books to come (two of which have already been published) Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire makes the Wizardg wld seem darker me complicated  scarier but me fun too!
I have read all the Harry Potter books  fd them very well wrten  They are great entertament f children  parents alike
GOBLET OF FIRE (GOF) opens as Harry is once aga trapped at the Dursleys' wag f school to beg  He gets sprung early by the Weasleys to attend the Quiddch Wld Cup but not befe the Dursley  Weasley families meet wh hilarious results  The Wld Cup is excg but the celebration ends on an omous noteOnce at school Harry  friends learn that there will be a yearlong competion the Triwizard Tournament volvg two other schools  As the competion progresses  becomes apparent that there are those who have goals beyond fosterg ties  the wizardg communy  The endg is dramatic feshadowg future eventsThis is the fourth book  the series  you are a fan of the series this is a must read although I would not recommend this f the very young  If you are not yeat a fan defely beg at the begng  enjoy!
I am only readg the Harry Potter series as a st of social study  you will :) I'm curious to see what kids ( adults) these days are so to So far I have read the first 4 books They do keep gettg better I will say that   my opion this book was the best one so far I have never read a book que this long befe but somehow the 753 pages did not drag all that much Sure she defely could use a better ed  some scenes could go  be cut but on the whole  hung together very nicely I liked the small plot variation  this one because I must adm  does get old havg the same plot all the time This book takes a much me serious tone than the previous ones  ends wh the return of Voldemt However I found  me believable than the others I am lookg fward to gettg the next two books  completg my "experiment" Hope this is helpful to the one  two people  the wld who have not yet read these! )
my children got me to read this series I'm proud to say I've enjoyed every  mute of   It brgs readg  wonder back to children AND  gives parents somethg to talk to our kids about  I've also dered the UK version  we'll s wh both books  read out loud simultanious  giggle over the dferences  English
This ISNT Joseph I am his oldest daughterI am an extreme Harry Potter fan I have read this book about 7 times  enjoyed  every time It is great to be able to laugh at the characters  at the same time be able to underst them as wellJK Rowlg really brgs Hogwarts out  my md  at times I really wish  was a real place It's combation of education  fun makes  a very wonderful read I cannot wa until the fal book comes outThe Goblet of Fire is a delightful tale of growg up adventure  appreciatg the people  your le as Harry comes to realize People READ THIS BOOK You will not regret any second  
"Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" the fourth Harry Potter book begs a change  the mood of the seriesF the first time we see a larger picture of the wld of the wizards-- we see both good  evil ptrayed  we see the actions of the evil  how  effects the nocent  The sty turns signicantly darker  such topics as tture terr  murder are all prevelent  the book  In sht 's not que as nocent  unassumg as the first three booksWhat  is though is fantastically well wrten wh the characters developg far me depth  developg the first real stirrgs of romantic feelgs as naive  nocent as they may be  JK Rowlg aga manages to construct a page-turner-- keepg the pace fast the prose reasonably light  the sty que terestg  I dged this one a star because  feels a b disjot  there are elements of the sty that seem to be a b less focused  essential than others-- everythg felt crical  the first three books but parts of this don'tNonetheless 's a superb book but 's the first one  the Harry Potter series I'd thk that parents should defely read befe their children to make sure they feel 's altogether appropriate--  is signicantly darker  may be harder to deal wh f younger children
This book was fun to read but I hate veraserum It gave the book a Scooby Doo endg What is a Scooby Doo endg you ask? Well  is when the Scooby Doo bunch -  this case the Harry Potter bunch catch the crimal/wizard behd  all  the accused throws away all of their 5th amendment rights (well who says they don't have that  the wizardg wld?)  makes a complete confession f all the wld to hear"If  wasn't f your meddlg kids! (confession confession)"And I thk  screws up the book Md not to spoil the book to those who have not yet read  This book has an amazgly tricate plot which is good And then they give the wizard who caused  all veraserum at the end  he explas everythg St of like Quirrell  The Scerer's Stone I mean was  really necessary f him to talk that much? Why do crimals/dark wizards feel the need to discuss their evil maniacal plans at liberty to those to so obviously oppose them? It's too simplisticOh well So aside from that hang up/gripe I still say this book was enjoyable It was a long read which is a good thg because you can pretend you are not a muggle  enjoy Harry's adventures longer

After the third Harry Potter book JK Rowlg was beg repive I don't know  I'm the only one noticg this I hate  when auths do that I qu after readg a couple chapters of the 4th I can't st  when Harry Potter is always the same friends wh such&such hater of so&so defeatg the voldemt guy (however you spell his name)  always ALWAYS at the dudley's  hogwartsI got so credibly bed
I adm that I was probably later than most  catchg onto the Harry Potter craze so I only just read the 4th book last week But  is my FAVORITE so farThis is a b me serious than most of the Potter books-- really gets to the details  you learn a lot about the wld of magic outside of Hogwarts (But f you Hogwarts lovers there's plenty of that too!)This is maybe not the laugh-out-loud funniest of the series but  is whout a doubt the most compellg And to boot nearly impossible to put down Don't let the length of the book deter you--Goblet of Fire is wth s weight  gold
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the fourth book  the Harry Potter series is a must read just as all of the others are This book may seem kd of long but the plot  suspense is so great you really don't even notice The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series begs not wh Harry but  one of Harry's dreams which may  may not be really happeng That's f you to decide After gog to the Quiddch (a wizardg spt) Wld Cup wh Ron  his family  wnessg disaster caused by the followers of Voldemt the Death Eaters Harry returns to Hogwarts his wizardg school  is somehow thrown to a tournament that he wasn't even supposed to be able to enter He knows that someone who is at least 17 must have put his name  the Goblet of Fire which draws the names f the tournament As he tries to fd out who might want him killed he is faced wh the challenges that are  the tournament And who knows? Maybe there will be a surprise at the end Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is my fave book  the Harry Potter series so farIt keeps you guessg until the very end I would suggest readg the first three books befe readg this one but I would really like to say that this book is great f fantasy  mystery lovers as Harry Potter has a lot of both 
I defely put this at the bottom of the series  The end is excellent but the rest of the book is really slow  very poly thought out  The b wh the pt keys was ludicrous Voldermt's side man could have just made Harry's book a ptkey Or asked him to brg him somethg off of the shelf which was  any of a thous dferent ways  The whole drivg fce behd the plot ( all of the slow wrg) is thus completely nullied  I realize that kids might not pick up on this  like the cheesy romance we were fced to endure    It thus falls solidly to the catagy of children's lerature - not f adults who could see through the gapg plot holes  po construction
i really liked the pokemon hbook when i was ltle the book cludes 150 pokemon creatures f eack pokemon has an illustration some 'facts' about   a description sometimes  has a 'pokedex pick' at the bottom tellg a ltle extra about the creatures i dont like  anyme because i am now much older but i recommend  to pokemon fans around the wld
This was I thk a very excg year f Harry Potter  I was tryg to guess the tle of the 4th Harry Potter book  I actually found out that some did know the EXACT tle a few weeks befe  was released  I could not believe that they(whoever those people are) was able to get  crect  I thk I would have chosen not to try  fd out Although I was eager to fd out the tle  The Burrow The Quiddch Wld Cup The cident "Masmdre" The Dark Mark  the sky Mad Eye Moody the guests from Beaxbaton  Durmstrang meetg Karkoff  Maddam Maxe the students Fleur Dela Coeur  Krum  I really liked the Tri Wizard Tournament  And He Who Must Not Be Namedgets his body  welcomes the Death Eaters his true family (unnervgly sad I thk)  Harry potter  a wizard duelthen Prii Incantatem  a excellent book I will contue to remember[]
To truly underst the amount of time that Rowlg has spent on the edg  wrg of this book one would do well to read  over a few times Details gone unnoticed durg the first read will become me preement  the second read  even me so durg future readsI have yet to read a book  which the plot was not so carefully laid out yet to fd a book which does not so plausibly unravel the sequence of events concerned wh the le of a fourteen year old boyApart from cpatg a style rich  thematic elements wh a truly -depth plot Harry Potter still holds his aura of magical appeal as this is easily one of the best books to have come out  a long time Wh such valy Harry Potter delivers sces
This book focusg on Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogwart's School is defately dferent from the 3 that preceeded  Harry must face challenges  deal wh opponents that no reader will expectAs always Harry  his friends Ron  Hermione get to plenty of mischief But this book is much me serious (No not Harry's godfather) than the first 3 In this book the students have new thgs to wry about Wizardg students from other schools love  death Yes death comes to Hogwarts   doesn't volve our fave ghoulish girl  the bathroom Harry  the other students are  f a year at Hogwart's that they won't soon fgetThis book is highly recommended Parents will probably want to read the book first befe allowg younger children to read 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire sets a new stage at Hogwarts even though Azkaban set the darker tone this one sets up the seriousness of the journey that Harry has gone through  is still gog through Wh the famous Tri-Wizard tournement that he mysteriously  accidently got signed up f  the threat of Voldamt returng to full power gives a tense feelg to the book Harry also begs to have an terest  Love As his crush that he started to develop  the third book blooms he wants to do somethg about that tooHermione  Ron the famous gang that hangs wh Potter contue to fight each-other  comedic ways there is a ht of puppy love even between the oposes The heroes are now fourteen years old  ready f anythg  so they thkThree excg tasks that will reveal the wner of the tournament crushs evil lds comg back to power!

JK Rowlg's Harry Potter has captured the imagation of children  adult alike usg fresh ideas when sties were runng dry She jected the kd of igaly missg f so long  children's fantasy novels She created a whole new wld so complete  detailed that you suspend you disbelief  get immersed immediately

When will Ron ever get a chance to step out of Harry's shadow?  What's to become of Fred  Gege's new entrepreneurial ventures?  Will Profess Snape ever stop hatg Gryffds ( Neville especially)?

This is simply by far the best harry potter book It wks perfectily The comedy of the earlier books is still present but the plot is alot better than the previous three Its alot darker  better especailly towards the end of  I've read all the books  while they're all good this is my fave The plot is the best the scenes have alot me action  the mystery of the first one's is still here This surpasses the fth one too If your harry potter fan  just like a good book this f you
In the fourth stallation of this amazg series Harry once aga fds himself face to face wh He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  lives through a duel wh him  In the begg of this book Harry is entered to the Triwizard Tournament by Barty Crouch Jr a suppter of Voldemt who is posg as ex-Aur Mad-Eye Moody  Despe a lack of enthusiasim  suppt from his fellow students at first cludg Ron Harry does surprisgly well through the tasks  enters to the third  fal task tied f first wh Cedric Diggy  They take the cup together which turns out to be a ptkey to Voldemt's rebirthg party where Cedric is immediately killed  Harry duels the Dark Ld  The only good thg that comes of this is that now atleast Voldemt's plans are spoiled as Harry was not supposed to survive  Dumblede now knows of his return
I have to adm that  took me some time to start the book  I picked this book up at least 6 times befe actually readg past the first chapter  My we had read  when  first came out  has been tellg me to stick wh   I'm glad I did    Once I got about 150 pages  I was hooked  Excellent read  Leaves you wantg me  me  the climactic end oh!!  You had better be able to set aside enough time to fish once you reach the endg chapters  you'll lose sleep thkg about  wonderg what happened  You have to know so you keep readg  you won't be disappoted!    Good from begng to end  ties up nicely  preparation f the fth book  I'll start that one next while this one is fresh  my head    ***** 5 Stars!
Every time a Harry Potter book comes out  just gets better  better She out does herself each time All you have to know is that I will be buyg the sixth book f sureHer wrg  this book is excuise I have to say that this may hold the place of her best book

() am mesmized by JKRowlg's abily to put so much excement  adventure to a fiction novel  She is the best I  have read the HArry Potter Series me than twice I look fward to her next release  can't wa to read these novels to my children
Ok An avid Harry Potter fan who appreciates that these books are aimed at children but pleaseWhy did they have to search the maze f a ptkey when any object could have been made a ptkey  harry's possesion- even perhaps the ptkey that took them to the Quidch wld cup??I thk this is a b of a cop out  could have que clearly been resolved  10 pages!!! Does Miss Rowlg have people proof read her books befe release!!Yes i read ! But i found the pri books less 'Riddled'  conflictg
Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire is the spectacular fourth book  the popular Harry Potter series However  is also the darkest book of the series so far This book retas the wild  fun fantasy that makes the wld of Harry Potter so fun  igal However this is  remas the darkest book of the series because  is the first of the series to have death as an underlyg themeIn this book Harry Potter is about fourteen years old He is begng to come to his own as an adolescent He has his first crush he starts to rebel agast his abusive aunt  uncle  he wants to spend time wh his friends When his friends ve him to the Quiddch Wld Cup Harry happily accepts not knowg that this event is gog to be the start of how his wld will change feverHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire is a tegral turng pot of the Harry Potter series   clearly shows The characters show their matury  each of them is showg the development of their own dividual personalies They are also showg attractions to the oppose sex  this book as wellThe violence  this book is tense f a children's book but  is not gratuous as  could have been There are 3 deaths self-mutilation  animal attacks but somehow Rowlg avoids havg thgs overly bloodyIn conclusion Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire is an stant classic It is sure to surprise  delight many Potter fans f generations to come The ratg that I give this book is 5 stars
JK Rowlg really shows her magic  this one  Harry Potter was one of the first series of books I really got to  year 4 really sts out  Here is a ltle paragraph you might fd on the back of the book: The Tri Wizard Tournament is a tournament that special wizards got chosen f  would compete  dangerous challenges to see who was the best wizard out of the three schools  It was stopped because  got to dangerous to students  When the three schools brg the tournament back only older aged students are aloud to enter but when harry gets picked he wonders did Voldemt put his name  the Goblet of Fire? Fd out  read this amazg book
I thk this one isw the best one  the seriesfull of new people but lots of action wh the characters we alreaddy love Some people say s too long but how could HP be too long? I was sry  had to endafter readg  very late Theres a ton of suspnseyou wonder through-out the book whos dog the dark mark I was surprised!
Goblet of Fire is by far the darkest of the series so far  Rowlg wrg  imagation contue to be rewardg to children  adults alike  This book was one of the quickets 700+ pages I have ever readI am a ltle concerned about some of the violence  this book  In this book nocent people are murdered  In this book there is bodily mutilation  As an adult I am not squeamish about these issues  However I am concerned about the reaction to this violence by on younger readers (2nd  3rd graders)  If the movie stays true to the book as well as the other movies have this one might be rated PG-13
I've got to be the 80 millionth person on Amazoncom alone who has reviewed at least one of the Harry Potter books However I have to wax poetic about this one just a ltle b  Of the five that have been released "Goblet of Fire" is my absolute fave I love  f the developg awareness of girls  boys at Hogwarts I love  f the growth of the terpersonal relationships but I love  so much f Harry's personal growth In this volume he has to face directly this wld that has been whispered of but that he has never had to deal wh  such startlg circumstances I believe that 's this book  which Harry fally loses his nocence about his suation  you can see him dealg wh the repurcussions of this  the fth book  JK Rowlg has yet to disappot me wh her engagg characters her growth  her wrg  this amazg magical wld that she has constructed This book just reaffirmed my love f Rowlg's wk  just as I eagerly anticipated the fth book so do I wa impatiently f the release of the sixth!
In this book we fd Harry our child hero becomg 14  is off to another year of Hogwarts education  This year there is a tournement that is held at Hogwards  which Harry is picked f  And f the rest of the book Harry is tryg to get through a year of school while confrontg the dferent challenges of the tournement that are set befe him  Then we fd Harry facg Voldemt f the very first time  a human body  Which is when  gets very terestg  A must read f all Harry Potter fans
Good sty  does seem to run on  on after a while i made  through about 3/4 of the book but got sick of  It is not as good as Order Of The Pheonix which was soon to follow but  you are a Harry Potter fan  can st near 1000 page (paperback) book go ahead you'll like 
like the whole book wasnt good enough  the endg of this book is goes to a new height of excellent  fantastic from cover to cover  so many twists dont even try to guess whats gonna happen next  this woman is outdog herself
By far my fave of the series   this the fourth stalment  the ever pleasg Harry Potter series Harry is put to a legendary wizard tournament where he gets to "play wh the big kids"  Intelligently wrten J K Rowlg wres yet another book not just f kids anyme beg 20 myself i am readg the book aga  She has a mystical way of describg thgs  people  a way not seen too often  Harry grows up a lot  this book as well when he has to rise up to a level of wizardry he has not yet been taught  must go  alone  Make sure that both you  your kids read all of the books  make sure you don't skip this one!
Wizards Wchcraft Magic If you fd any of those thgs terestg then read this book! Harry Potter's le is centered around these three paranmal enties An phan at only one year of age  takes not a genius to fer that Harry has not lived the le of an average 14 year old In fact at the tender age of one he endured an attempt on his le by the most powerful dark wizard sce Grdelwald  1945 Ld Voldemt began his reign of terr several years befe Harry was bn killg everyone who stood  his path One night he went to the Potter's house seekg to kill them all He killed Harry's parents easily but when he tried to kill Harry the curse rebounded upon himself leavg Ld Voldemt powerless  Harry wh a lightng-bolt shaped scar Now Harry is a 14 year old whose scar hurts when Ld Voldemt is near  feelg especially murderous At 734 pages this book is just some light readgHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the fourth book  this thrillg fantasy series is pivotal To me this is my second fave book  the series behd Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix sce the deeper you get to the series the me excement there is Unlike previous novels there is no school Quiddch teams as somethg larger is happeng at Hogwarts - The Triwizard Cup Every book shows Harry overcomg some dficulty  this event proves to be Harry's predicament  this grippg novel Every time that you thk that you have figured out where this novel is gog  takes another twist However the climax of this novel could be expected  you consider what  would take to make the series excg a few books later Also many new characters are added such as a poisonous columnist Ra Skeeter as well as characters from Beuaxbatons  Durmstrang rival European Magic Schools competg agast Hogwarts  the Triwizard cup  Naturally death is somethg that Harry has been accustomed to but could be prepared f suddenness of The Harry Potter series is full of mals so naturally  did not surprise me due to the nature of this fabulous book that  would contue the series' mal that  "It is our choices that show what we truly are far me than our abilies"  This book is wrten  a way that is sued to all audiences After all  is about a teenager dealg wh much me adult suations I recommend  to any one who enjoys suspense novels I am a person who scares easily yet even due to the hryg nature of some scenes I truly found this novel thrillgprepared f suddenness of The Harry Potter series is full of mals so naturally  did not surprise me due to the nature of this fabulous book that  would contue the series' mal that  "It is our choices that show what we truly are far me than our abilies"  This book is wrten  a way that is sued to all audiences After all  is about a teenager dealg wh much me adult suations I recommend  to any one who enjoys suspense novels I am a person who scares easily yet even due to the hryg nature of some scenes I truly found this novel thrillg
im on page 288  so far this is the best book so far i cant stop readg  i got  like 3 days ago  i  cant stop readg  i read the first second  third  this is the best so far
I've had the Goblet of Fire sce  first came out I stopped readg those books until now I've realized how great of a book the fourth stallment is  to say kids arent the only ones who like these books In the fourth stallment of Harry Potter s a me action packed  darker tale of Harry Potter It is also much dferent than the other 3 years F there is a Triwizard tournament  no Quiddch because of  A dream about You-Know-Who makes Harry Potter to be me careful Also the characters are basically well you get to know them like they are your best friends Its not a blatant description eher but me of a learng from their actions So  all this is an amazg book I'd have to say I was impressed The wst thg about this book is  seems like you read f hours  you dont even put a dent  the amount of pages  has But I am glad  was a long book as well as the 5th one If your not to fantasy stay away from these books because you will probably hate them  maybe not these are just that good
This book is pretty potless I like to read books wh emotion  sight(not the wthless kd md you) I'll read the same book twice(my recd's actually ten though  yaa I know a lot of dks read the same books twice)but I will never read the exact same kd of book twice  I know a lot of other readers wont eher so what's the pot of five bloody books? This book's characters are  typical You know I didn't md The Ld of the Rgs crazy dwarfs  stuff but this book's out-thereness is kda dumb The auther has so many terms(but not nearly as wse as The Lion the Wch  The Wardrobe)This book's actually kda bg It just skipps from one thg to the next whout really gettg to each characters reactions feelgs  actions(The characters don't have habs  opions that they take to action)  I can underst why 8 year olds might like   even 13 year olds but adults? Come on adults rave on about somethg dferent Oh yaa  stop blamg your disda towards your kids on Harry  Potter Dissect somthg like your parentg skills
In this book  was apparent that the auth was wishg to lead the series to another level  Rowlg must have thought that wrg this book-that was around a hundred pages longer than  really should have been was a good sag way to the charact development f the fth book  However the book had spot where the plot seemed to drag on  didn't grasp the attention as well as her previous books  Rowlg also sticked to her comon theme of Potter vs Ld Voldermont  This seemed to me like she was puchg the good vs evil thg a ltle to much considerg that she had already used  f her first three booksHowever this book did do a lot f charact develpment  was wth the read  only to see how the characts were evolved  to set up the fth book nicely
I love this book!!!! Out of the series this is by far the best I love every part I did not stop till i read  all from cover to back Everythg was perfectly wrten The details were supurb The Triwizard Tournamant was a brillant idea My fave one would have to be the under water challenge The mermaids were a great touch I was on my toes wonderg  Harry would save his friends  time I also liked the Yuke Ball The description of Hermione walkg down the stairs  her gown was so perfectly described that I could picture her as  she was stg  front of me I thk this book is the best  will probably will be f me It is sooo packed wh many good ideas that just maybeJK can come up wh somethg better I really can not wa f the movie I hope  can atleast be as half as good as the book JK you have made my obcession even me crazy by wrg this book
After a three-year hiatus sce middle school I fally had the opptuny to return to the wld of Harry Potter The Goblet of Fire picks up where the Prisoner of Azkaban left off where Harry is a year older  a year wiser while attendg his fourth year at Hogwarts Le is far from usual even f this young wizard as Harry struggles wh the harrowg challenges of the Triwizard Tournament the negative publicy from yellow journalist Ra Skeeter  the trials of growg up This fourth stallment exped on the Harry Potter universe revealg that the wld of magic is not limed to Bra wh wches  wizards of all nationalies  races  entire magic schools founded  far off countriesThe Goblet of Fire is a very imagative  well-wrten novel as wh the rest of the series Rowlg's novel is vividly wrten   gives the reader a good idea of the settgs but  never gets bogged down wh extraneous details  leaves enough f the imagation Because of 's Brish nature however I couldn't get any of the childish "hum" - alas what people fd funny is an acquired taste I enjoyed how the plot was me grown up than any of the previous novels to f a me mature audience  a me mature Harry While this is one of the longest books of the series much of the first few chapters seem to be all filler I could have done whout some of the events such as Hermione's one-girl house-elf civil rights movement  all the ltle side conversations between characters While these sequences perpetuated character development readg them felt labiousAs I saw Harry grow up over the course of the series  was easy to feel sympathy f his character Not only is he an dary person thrown to a trent of extradary events he struggles to cope wh le - as wh any teenager Wh many plot les left danglg at the end of this book four me years at Hogwts  adolescence left f Harry ( four me books to go no doubt) there are still plenty of ways f our hero to get to trouble  face death aga I can't waf Harry ( four me books to go no doubt) there are still plenty of ways f our hero to get to trouble  face death aga I can't wa
I am not a Harry Potter fanatic but I did beg readg the series this summer  fished #4 just last night The series has been an easy  enjoyable read GoF was very trigug  satisfyg at parts It was the usual combation of fun mystery  surprises we've all come to love from #s 1-3 I especially liked the character development of the three ma characters that give us an the impression that the characters really are growg up I "flew" (at least f me) through this book  ended wh a very satisfied feelg However this book  the series had way WAY too much filler I don't even remember beg pulled to the book until about page 350 of 700  so The first 300 pages were mdless ch-chat about nothgs that really didn't hold my terest much (Next 2 sentences are a mild spoiler but not really) The whole house elf liberation deal? Way too much fmation considerg  goes nowhere  the end I had heard the pot of the series was to crease the length of each book as  progresses I hope this is not the case because the mdless filler was defately evident  #4  #5 is even longer
Harry Potter is so easy to read  hard to put down  I loved that she added a Chese girlfriend  this book  There are many surprises  twists  this sty I can't wa to see the movie version  I love anythg Harry Potter Even though these books are lots of pages s que fast to get thru  Daniel Radclfe is a great act  he does a fantastic job playg Harry  the movies
In 2000 the fourth of J K Rowlg's excg books featurg her beloved character of Harry Potter was released  Entled "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" we fd Harry once aga facg his arch enemy the very dark wizard whose very name creates great fear wh the wizardg wld: Ld Voldemt Towards the end of Harry's summer vacation that he spends wh the ever-unpleasant Dursleys (Uncle Vernon Aunt Petunia  Cous Dudley) Harry received an unexpected vation to attend the Quiddch Wld Cup match wh the Weasley family (the family of one of Harry's dearest friends Ron Weasley)  After some obvious objections Uncle Vernon agrees but is concerned about how the Weasley's will arrive to pick up Harry  Instead of arrivg  a car as any muggle family would the Weasleys arrive via their preferred method of transptation: flew powder  Unftunately the Dursley's had converted the fireplace to an electric one but Arthur Weasley clears the way f the rest of the Weasley clan to arrive by blowg a hole through the chimney wall which he promises to repair to the fear of the Dursleys  Beg his first time to watch a professional quiddch match Harry is extremely exced especially sce Arthur obtaed the best tickets possible however a very unusual event occurs followg the game: a group of "death eaters" (suppters of Ld Voldemt) beg to harass a family of muggles at the campse where so many wizards & wches are stayg f the game  Then the highly feared symbol of Ld Voldemt appears  the sky causg ever me panic among the guests  disruption f the Mistry of Magic  A lowly house-elf named Wky takes the blame  is subsequently fired from service to Percy Weasley's boss at the Mistry of Magic Barty Crouch but everyone returns to their homes  Harry Ron  Hermione Granger return to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry f their fourth year  However this is gog to be a very dferent year at Hogwarts as there won't be any ter-house quiddch matches  Instead a revived Triwizard Tournament will be held between a champion to represent Hogwarts  two other champions each representg other wizardg schools  Albus Dumblede sets an age-lim of 17 meang that no one under that age may participate  as tradion dictates the impartial Goblet of Fire selects each school's champion  However the Goblet of Fire picks not the expected three names of champions but four wh Harry beg the fourth  Claimg that he did not sneak his name to the goblet Profess Dumblede is cled to believe Harry but not everyone does  However  is clear that someone does want Harry to participate  the dangerous tournament  The only questions are who  f what reason?  You'll just have to read this very excg  compellg book to fd out!Each of JK Rowlg's books about Harry Potter keep gettg better  better  I was very impressed wh the first three but the fourth at a staggerg 734 pages matas a high a level of terest throughout wh s many unexpected plot twists  turns  I was impressed wh some of the wds that JK Rowlg used that would clearly require a child to quire wh a dictionary to underst the meang  Like the previous books the fourth has several subplots such as Hermione's determation to free the house-elves Hagrid's terest  Madame Maxime (the head of one of the French wizardg school known as Beauxbatons) Hermione's apparent terest  Vikt Krum (who not only attends the Durmstrang wizardg school but is also the very famous Bulgarian quiddch player whose feats durg the Quiddch Wld Cup amazed everyone)  the ongog mischief from the ghost named Peeves  A vast asstment of new characters are troduced  the fourth book cludg several people from the Mistry of Magic the new profess agast the dark arts ('Mad-Eye' Moody) the various people from the other wizardg schools  The book also has several returng characters from the second book ("Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secrets") cludg Dobby  Moang MyrtleWhout a doubt JK Rowlg's fourth book entled "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" resoundgly earns 5 out of 5 stars  The twists  turns that this sty takes make predictg s outcome impossible  I very much look fward to readg the fth book as well as the sixth book that will be published  a few months  I also look fward to the film version of "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" that will be released  theaters later this year  After readg "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire"  was very easy to underst why the excement level f the fth book (which was published  2003) was so high the various people from the other wizardg schools  The book also has several returng characters from the second book ("Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secrets") cludg Dobby  Moang MyrtleWhout a doubt JK Rowlg's fourth book entled "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" resoundgly earns 5 out of 5 stars  The twists  turns that this sty takes make predictg s outcome impossible  I very much look fward to readg the fth book as well as the sixth book that will be published  a few months  I also look fward to the film version of "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" that will be released  theaters later this year  After readg "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire"  was very easy to underst why the excement level f the fth book (which was published  2003) was so high
Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire  F my book rept I chose a magnicent novel tled "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire"  J K Rowlg is the auth of this unfgettable fiction masterpiece "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" takes place at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizadry  Hogwarts is located at a hard to fd location  the Uned Kgdom  This mysterious excg  fun sty takes place  1994 "The Goblet of Fire" centers around a Person vs Person / Good vs Evil conflict  Harry is constantly havg to defend himself agast the antics of the Dark Ld Voldemt  his group of followers called the Death Eaters  When Harry was a boy Voldemt killed his parents but he was not able to kill Harry  He became week  is tryg to become me powerful so he can ultimately fish his mission  destroy Harry Potter Harry Potter is the 14 year old Protagonist  "The Goblet of Fire"  Voldemt is the Antagonist  the book  Ron Weasly   Hermione Granger Harry's best friends are Static Characters they stick wh Harry through the wst of times  Doby the House Elf is a Round Character  the majy of Hogwarts students are Stock Characters The theme of "The Goblet of Fire" is the events that take place durg the Triwizard Tournament  The Triwizard Tournament is a three school competion between the Hogwarts Beauxbaton  Durmstrang schools It consists of one champion from each school competg agast the other champions  a  three event Tournament  The three school champions f the Triwizard Tournament which takes place at Hogwarts  are chosen by an impartial judge an old cup given the tle The Goblet of Fire  The wner gets one thous Galleons the highest fm of wizard  coage  prestige f themselves  their school Harry's name however is unexpectedly chosen by the Goblet  he is bound to compete accdg to the rules  The problem is that nobody knows who put Harry's name  the Goblet because only students seventeen  older were allowed to enter the competion  Harry believes that whoever put his name  the Goblet has   f him  wants him to die while competg  one of the Triwizard Tournament tasks  Harry Ron  Hermione decide to take every task one at a time  concentrate on makg  through all the tasks alive J K Rowlg was very successful  presentg her central idea throughout "The Goblet of Fire"  When Profess Dumblede the head of Hogwarts spoke to the students at the openg banquet he clearly stated that the Goblet of Fire would select the most wthy students to compete f  "The Triwizard Cup the gly of their school  a thous Galleons prize money" (Rowlg JK)  I thought the theme was outstg  perfectly wrten  The book was so excg I was up till Four AM Readg  All aspects of le are neatly folded to the Harry Potter books  a splendid st of way  The recognizable  characters  the way the sty flows makes f great readg  The characters are perfect wh ones you love  others you love to hate This is a very memable book  there is one le that I really like  this book  takes place when Sirius Harry's Godfather is talkg to Harry Ron  Hermione  He says "If you want to know what a man's like take a good look at how he treats his feris not his equals"(Rowlg JK)  This is a great statement that is very true So far "Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire" is my fave book  the Harry Potter series It is my fave book of all time  has fluenced many peoples lives young  old One of the reasons  is so popular is that everybody can feel as  they are side the book gog through all of Harry's successes  failures wh him All the characters come to le  you do not wish that there were such thgs as wches wizards magic  you know that they are real  Harry Potter is an amazg sty about growg up makg the right choices  learng from your mistakesmagic  you know that they are real  Harry Potter is an amazg sty about growg up makg the right choices  learng from your mistakes
I have always been an avid fan of Harry Potter but this book by far is the top on my list! After purchasg my own copy of "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" I defely could not set the book down Rowlg takes the reader to a whole dferent realm of wizardry  magic that the imagation alone cannot accessThis is the book that I actually "got to" the most I truly felt the emotion of each character durg their various disposions I even remember myself feelg angry  then happy the next Wh Rowlg you will never know what to expect wh Harry  his years at HogwartsSo what's  ste f Harry his fourth year? The great Tri-Wizard Tournament of course However wh anythg big that ever goes on at Hogwarts there's bound to be some adventure that goes along wh  Along wh the troduction of new characters the plot takes the reader f a "dive" wh s endless twists  turnsAfter readg "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" I can only image how great the movie will be!
Until recently I was one of those who had never picked up a "Harry Potter" book to do anythg other than shelve  on a library shelve --- I had only seen the movies Fally my terest got the better of me  I decided I had to read the books  I read the books  der but "Goblet" was the first one I was psired to re-read "Goblet" is the first of the longer books of the series over double the size of previous edions Nevertheless  is a compellg tale from start to fish  a very imptant turng pot  the series If you only read this once I can pretty much guarantee that you will miss out on any number of imptant details Read the book  enjoy  Take a break from   need be  then return to  to take  what you missed befe  Whout spoilg too much detail I will attempt to give a brief summary of what happens  the book Harry Potter is ved to the Wld Quiddch Cup  which a number of strange events take place He then returns to Hogwart where a competion threatens to place him  mtal danger Readers also learn much me about Harry's magical wld  about the vast culture of wizards from around the wld that hab  New friendships are fmed  old ones tested  this adventure
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the book  my opion that sts out the most of the series thus far Its my fave of the series thus far  has great sty tellg  excellent characters This book at no pot made me bed  even though  was around 750 plus pages I still got  done  about three days That should tell people how great this book is when people are gettg books 750 plus pages done  three days! Excellent book highly recommend
This is defely my fave book  the series so far The adventure contues as Harry proceeds to attend his fourth year at the Hogwarts school Once aga mysterious events keep happeng around Harry that seem to promote the evable return of his arch nemesis Ld Voldemt Harry is fced to a tri-wizard tournament that hasn't happened f many years Competg schools will test their best agast Harry  this dangerous  thrillg contest Meanwhile hts about Voldemt's return keep "turng up" while his fahful followers the Death Eaters start raisg havoc A sister plot thickens as Harry comes to realize that he may have been fced to the tournament by one of these dark wizards Can Harry  his friends Ron & Hermione figure out the mysteries behd the tri-wizard tournament befe 's too late?Once aga Rowlg provides a fantastic entry to the Harry Potter saga Her books keep gettg better wh each release Wh each book the sty takes on a darker premise but Rowlg always keeps her sense of hum " check" Even though the book is an credible 734 pages long  never seems to "drag" I quickly read through this book always wantg to see what happened on the next page It has defely made me look fward to readg the next book  the series Harry Potter  the Order Of The Phoenix
What is the book about?How did I like this book?Is  rereadable?Child-Friendly?Friendly?<BR>Ok I'll stop haha
"Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is both an terestg fast paced st-alone book  a great midpot to the series Somehow Harry has been chosen to compete  the Triwizard Tournament even though he is supposed to be too young to enter Someone hopg that Harry will be killed  the tournament arranged f him to participate--but who is ? All we know is that  is someone at Hogwarts but there are several suspicious cidates Meanwhile  seems that Ld Voldemt is growg stronger  preparg to return When will he make his appearance what does this have to do wh the Triwizard Tournament?My terest  the mystery kept me readg quickly--although this is a long book over 700 pages I read   a few days whout feelg that I was taxg myself An excg book that leaves you anxious to read me of Harry's adventures
Rowlg's longest thus far  the series is the best so far It is the most fleshed out  has the most detailed  tricate plot
This was my fave Harry Potter so far  the series After a lengthy vis to an ternational Quidch match (as a spectat) wh his friends  the Weasley family Harry returns to Hogwarts only to fd that he will shtly be competg  a very prestigious contest of his own - agast students from other wizardg schools not just one of his own classmatesIn this book Harry as appropriate f an adolescent is subject to mood swgs sulkess  decision which is his downfall from m thgs like fdg a partner f a ball to decipherg the contest clues At the end the competion takes a deadly turn which I will only say volves You Know How And on a lighter note Hermione gets her first boyfriend
Rowlg comes from that fe tradion of prolix Brish auths such as Tolkien & Churchill none of whom ever met a modier they didn't like  These auths firmly ascribe to the philosophy "why use one page to describe a scene when you can do   10 pages?"  Some people thk that the never-endg stream of prose represents great composional skill & mastery of the language  Believe me any graduate student can pad a semar paper as skillfully as Rowlg has Books 4 & 5 but the graduate student is wrg to a dferent audienceWhat is gog on here?  I am guessg that because of the success of the series Rowlg has been allowed to run amok  no ed has the nerve to re  a money-makg rogue elephant  Unftunately  appears that Rowlg has some dficulty sustag a coherent narrative over such a long period of time  I can only image what Books 6 & 7 will weigh  at but  wouldn't surprise me  they end up beg 1000-1200 pages apiece  The narrative will only collapse under the weight of a book that long  would ru a series that got off to a good start  If Rowlg is terested  the qualy of her wk  not simply  rakg  the cash she needs to underst that me is not necessarily better
The fourth  most excg year of Harry Potter's wizardg education is told  Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire The sty brgs new  excg characters creatures  breath takg twists The sty starts off two weeks befe Harry is to go back to Hogwarts He is retrieved by his close friends the Weaslys Where they ve him to jo them to spectate at the year's quich wld cup This year at Hogwarts the quich season is canceled due to the comg of two new schools  the tri wizard competion Most of the students were very disappoted but once the competion was under way they fgot all about that years quich season I would tell you but I am pretty sure you can already guess who participates f the Hogwarts team The competion is fierce  treacherous  not only does harry have to thk about the Tri-wizard competion but he has Voldemt  his dark followers after him There are many obstacles  Harry's way see how he escapes death numerous times  the fourth book of the series As I read this book I grew me exced  curious I had many questions  the only way to fd the answers was to keep readg I could almost feel the emotions as Harry set fth at many tasks J K Rowlg has out done herself yet aga  this better then ever Harry Potter sty If I were to rate this book I would give  4 out of 5 The only reason I discarded one pot was because at times  could get a b bg This was only at a few places through out the book To become a part of the magical wd all you have to do is pick up the book   will take you away  s phenomenal way as  does children from 8 to grparents at the age of 90
This is the best book I have ever read When harry goes back to Hogwarts he learns of the triwizard chalange  he gets put  the cuphhe has to go three chalanges to becomethe champion to learn me read this book
This sty was one of the best I have ever read It is about Harry  the goblet He got his named placed  the goblet  only 6 years  above  he is a 4th year So  was a twist So he got his named pick  had to do all of these tests So the wner would get ALOT of Money So teredted to hear me? If you are I suggest you read this book I promise you well not be dissapoted wh this book I recomend this book to everyone One of the best I thk but I am sure some people would disagree wh me but I thk  is the best So go  read! I give this book 5 stars
I thought the book was excellent I could hardly put  down because  was so full of action I almost got grounded because I would not put the book down
The Goblet of Fire is a very terestg book about a young wizard who attends Hogwarts a wizardg school The book has several good sellg pots It is suspensful throughout the entire sty   has very creative characters The book teaches people of all ages what  truly means to be a friend Most people will be able to relate wh the protagonist  the trials he faces  Although  has several good pots there are some thgs that you might not like about  Some parts are violent so this isn't a very good book f young kids  Some people might not like  because  is a ltle b wdy The Goblet of Fire is very hard to follow  you have not read the other books first  However I highly recommend this book
This has to be the best book series sce Ld Of The Rgs I'm currently on my second readg of   still cant put  down JK Rowlg is a great auth  I really hope these books keep comg
JK Rowlg did a wonderful job  wh class quailty of wdsUm the reason I had rated this book a five is because of detials of the sty le Very terestg le of Harry I'm now stuck  book five hopefully book 6 7 comes quickly

The fourth Harry Potter stallment "The Goblet of fire" is an excellent book Havg read all 5 of the series multiple times I feel that Goblet of Fire is my fave It takes Harry Ron  Hermionie through their fourth year at Hogwarts This year Harry is faced wh many me advanced tasks than  his previous years  he faces Voldermt once aga "Goblet of Fire" was dficult  the begng to get to  started slow but after the first 10 chapters (out of 37)the sty really picks up JK Rowlg did an excellent job contug the series
I really enjoyed this book I have read all of the Harry Potter books  after i am fished i can not wa until the next book comes out!!!! I would recommend this book to anyone who can read!!!! It is an awesome book that even adults can appreciate!!! This book defley gets five stars!!!!!
I tohught this book was very terestg but  was about 200 pges too long so i gave  four stars
I have a tendency to wre a summarized comment of these HP books I read as well as other books First I want to say that HP5 was a great read  my opion - although a long one Despe s length I had a hard time puttg the book down  the mng times when I could read  I tried to read as much of  up until I was runng late f wk The only disadvantage I found wh the extra length of this stallment was the endless backtrackg by the auth I kept readg about Harry's experiences from his previous years to where I just about te my hair out from s roots Repeatedly I kept sayg to myself -- YES I know this already I read HP1 - HP3! The backtrackg that the auth should have exercised me was when she had the characters ht about what had happened the previous year through their dialogue One example  HP3 Madame Pomfrey is relieved to hear the new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher Lup is somewhat versed  curg magical ailments These kds of underlyg hts give her wk a charmg reflection on Harry's experiences both old  new This is not the only stallment that the auth is guilty of this but  is the first where  happens the most often My advice to JKR - just tell the audience they need to read the books  der  otherwise be lost  the process of gettg to know Harry Potter entirely
I couldn't put  down especially  the last two hundred pages Def a series I will be sad to see end JK Rowlg has created another enchantg wld complete wh good people bad people people you aren't sure of Twists  this book turned out wonderful! Can't wa to read The Order of the Phoenix
Rowlg has taken a step up wh her fourth stalment The first three books were action-packed  full of fun mystery  suspense And Rowlg has delivered a solid dose of this aga But the development of themes  this episode sets  apart - perhaps a reward from Rowlg f the enthusiasm of her adult readers as well A multude of sub-plots bubble away each reflectg  commentg on our own wld's prejudices  problems while the action takes no step back to allow f these developments It is as drawg  racy as ever wh surprises at the end that outdo the previous books' twists 'The Goblet of Fire' is a superb jigsaw puzzle which comes together to tie up perfectly at the end while leavg you wantg me
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire one of the best (so far)  the Harry Potter series is an highly imagative read JK Rowlg clearly wanted to dazzle her readers wh a sty packed wh various subplots layg numberous clues  red herrgs leadg the reader down one way  turng them around  another Though the plot was very well-kept she seemed to absbed  the structure of the events that she didn't pay much attention to the much simpler plot holes Though a mistake is caught her  there  is a thoughly great read
When I was told I had to read the first four books of Harry Potter I did not want to read them because they were so long  Once I started to read the first book I wanted to keep on readg  Out of the four books I have read so far I liked Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  In this book  takes longer to get to Hogwarts the wchcraft  wizardry school which they attendJK Rowlgs uses a lot of discription on all of the chapters
I used to thk this book was burg nothg that would attract me to read But now I love  By thought dferent This book has a lot talk about the places  mentioned  how  was deseribed All that I did imaged when readg  I liked  very dferent from other books Probably becaise  was dferent  new to me I enjoy readg  I have even thought of readg the whole 4 edion book's to my ltle brother i bet he would enjoy  as wellI liked this book because  talk's about animals that don't exist The characters are dferent from all the book's I've read befe I liked this book because  took me back to my childhoodI recomend this book to everybody F those who loved to read children's bookI thk  children read the Harry Potter book edions they are gog to love  Sce  has a lot of magical events Kid's are a attracted to the adventerous books parent's might like this kd of books f their kids Knowg they are not violent  not a bad example f them This book is very educational f any age  teaches a kid not to fight not to have enemies  not to cause trouble It alo tell's f chdren to keep on gog to schoolThis book can also be f parents f them to learn the magical wld that children would love to learned about
Well i read the first four book  one of my college class At first i wasn't terested  them when i first heard about them they look bg  very long But when we started to read them as we were gog on they get terestg  wanted to read some me They are Ok books but out of their four book the one i enjoyed me was "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" why i enjoyed this one me was because  has me romance because the the boys  girls  the book start noticg each other  has thgs that happened that a lot of people could relate to the thgs that happened Theirs also a lot of good thg  bad thgs that happen though out the book i really encourage other to read the books they are good I thk the books are ok
Well the book of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a all right The book was kd of bg the couple few chapters but the rest of the chapters were getg better  better The chapters were about a young boy name Harry Potter who had a bad past when he was just a baby that he had to face the person who had killed his father  his mother when he was bn That Harry had to figth him to get reat of him well the part that i did like about the book that so many people were beang so mean to harry patterwell i thk kids from 10  up should read them so they could underst the books These four book were the only books that i read  my whole le that i fish read them
I didn't really enjoy readg  school but after readg all Harry Potter books I changed my md Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was my fave book out of all four I haven't yet started the fth one yet but I pretty sure 's gog to me tense  exg The way the sty goes makes you feel wantg me Readg somethg  the begng whout even knowg why 's there  the first makes you thk  the answers gog to come up soon That's the way this book started F stance the person who put Harry's name  the goblet was Mad-Eye-Moody which turned out to be the son of Barty Crouch pretendg to be Moody Fdg out all these thgs makes you wantg me  wantg to figure out the other stuff that doesn't make sense Another Example is when Wky Mr Crouch's house elf was at the top of the box at the quiddch game savg him a seat By readg on you fd out that Mr Crouch's son was  the empty seat wh an visibily coat on All Harry Potter books are mysterious  adventures I recommend the books to anyone that enjoys mysterious  adventures books You know what I recommend this book to anyone
I thk the book is was good  was my first time readg Harry Potter  the Goblrt of Fire The book has lots of avdantges that Harry Potter Ron Weasley  HermioneF example when Harry went had to go though the dragons f the first task that he had to go do f the championship So there was lots of avdantages that Harry had to go threw Well one of my fave character was Sirius Black because when I first found out that he was Harry Potters legal guardian Well Nlack was very brave  very helpful I really recommened this book to all students  parent that feel that Harry Potter is to much f ltle kids
Well these are the only books that I have really read  my whole le  I thk that all the four books are great The one that I really liked so far is the fourth book "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" This book is good ses that first chapter that how i knew that this book was gog to be good When i was readg the book sometimes i would thk that i was  there wh Harry  his friends If u have readed all the other books on Harry Potter  you have not readed this one you are missg out  a good sty
WhenI started readg the 1st Harry Potter book I though "WOW this book is great" In the second I was left wh "Neat I bet they keep gettg better" The 3rd was just what I expected BETTER! As I started readg The Goblet of Fire i was a ltle disappoted because I wasn't as terested as the first 3 books After i got past chapter 21 I found myself readg f hoursthe sty kept gettg to good to put down I fshed readg  I was left wh "I want me"I had to go  get the 5th copy The books just keep gettg better! Just cant wa until the last 2 come out!
I thk the "Goblet Of Fire" was a good bookJust like all the other Harry Potter books I don't underst why some people thk the Harry potter books are evil The Harry Potter books to me are friendly  nice Yesthey have magic  them but when they have magic 's ethier f good to help HarryRon  Hermonie to get away from the the bad guys Or somethg silly that Harry is learng  one of his classes I like the Harry Potter books alot because even though I'm  college I can go back  relate to what ethier Harry  Ron  Hermonie is gog though I thk  you can relate to a book  makes  me strg  you want to read  meI thk all ages should be able to open the book  enjoy them I thk middle schools  maybe even high schools should be readg the Harry Potter booksLast but not least I did not really like readg that much befe But when I started readg Harry Potter books I liked  because they were funny  i could relate to the books I thk everyone should at least read one book of Harry Potter to see what they thk
When I first started readg this book I thought  was gog to be bg But once you start readg  you get  to   you wonder what might happen next So far I have read all four of the Harry Potter books  this was one that I like the most I really like the fact that they don't have the Quiddch games no me I like the fact that  oder to play the game you have to be 17 years  older because there is me danger out there Once you read this book you'll want to read the 5th book because I know I do I like the fact that they show how kids really are know they get jealous of each other  that's how kids really do act If you have read the first three books I recommend you to read the fourth because to me that's the best   might be yours too
The first thg that I want to say to those whom cricize the book is "Have you even bothered readg ?" I thk that the peope that say that the books are evil  that they are teachg kids wchcraft is that they are wrong This book is alot like the Wizard of Oz  some ways Like  the wizard of Oz the ltle girl Dothy is tryg to get home  she has to get away from the wch Yes there is that wd "Wch" Why don't they try to ban that book  movie? It deals wh wches as does the Harry Potter books If you haven't read the book I recomend you start readg  It has to do alot wh friendship Harry Ron  Hermione are always helpg each other out Harry doesn't care  Ron is po  that Hermione is not a pure bred wizard He accepts them f who they are  not where they come from It is much like what kids face each day Most of them get picked on because they don't have what others have  because they look a dferent way  are a dferent col of sk The auth of these books covers all of that  the series I thk that this a very good book to read as are the first 3 I suggest you read  once you pick  up you won't be able to put  down Especially when you get to the part when Harry is captured by Voldemt  he manages to escape wh the help of his dead father
Wouldn't  be so cool to be a wizard?  Would you be surprised  one day an owl delivered a letter tellg you that you were a wizard  were accepted to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry? I know I would! Well this fantasy happened to a boy named Harry Potter when he was about 10 years old on a nmal day  a nmal house on Privet Drive Harry Potter lives wh his aunt  uncle  their son Dudley who annoys Harry to death Harry's Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon treat him like dirt because when he was not even a year old he was dropped off at their dostep after survivg an attack from the most powerful wizard  the wizardg wld: Ld Voldemt Harry is famous after the attack because no one had ever survived a blow from Ld Voldemt the most feared wizard  the wld He is very angry  Voldemt is startg to go after Harry aga Harry is very popular  Hogwarts f his scar from Ld Voldemt but he doesn't like the attention In this adventurous  suspenseful novel Harry Potter is enterg his fourth year  Hogwarts His best friends who he met on the tra ride to Hogwarts  his first year are named Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger Hermione is the perfect student  makes sure Harry  Ron stay out of trouble Ron is very loyal to Harry  they have some wild adventures together Both Hermione  Ron help Harry through his adventures  are honest  friendly to each other At the begng of his fourth year they have some surprised guests show up  some awkward ways Two other schools arrive at Hogwarts ved by Dumblede the headmaster of Hogwarts Ltle did the students know they were gog to hold a Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts There is a magic goblet that chooses a representative from each school The person who is chosen from each school must take on tasks that the schools have chose The tournament is full of danger  requires love bravery  strength In this genius novel friends have to fight  trust each other  each  every task they meet I encourage you to read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire to stretch your imagation  take you to an adventurous novel you will never fget!

As an adult reader I was hesant at first to get to the Harry Potter series However after fally givg to the hype I decided to pick up the 1st book  absolutely fell  love wh Hogwarts Despe the length Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is possibly my fave book  the series The magical wld outside of Hogwarts gets expled a ltle me  this book startg at the Quiddch Wld Cup And stead of the tradional Quiddch House Cup 3 wizardg schools compete  the Triwizard tournament to crown a sgle hero  champion But don't be fooled the real magic of this book still lies wh the walls of Hogwarts  the spell-bdg adventures of Harry Ron  Hermione Don't blk  you just might miss somethg
The Goblet of Fire is about as long as the previous three Harry Potter books put together  I was wried gog to this that the magic would run out - that Rowlg might have been cavg under the pressure of havg to produce a Harry Potter book each year  Some of the reviews I had read suggested as muchWell the magic is still gog strong  True this is a long book (we do not arrive at Hogwarts until around page 200) but like Harry I want to spend as much time at Hogwarts as possible  The sty is just as engrossg here as  the previous novels  This  fact may be my fave so farThe sty concerns a contest amongst several schools of wizardry  The book begs wh Ld Voldemt so I don't thk I'm givg too much away by sayg he has somethg terestg planned f Harry  the tournamentThis is darker than the previous two books  The similary wh Ld of the Rgs becomes me apparent  As Harry grows up circumstances become me  me dire  I have not yet read Order of the Phoenix but I am lookg fward to 
All the harry potter books are great jkrowlg has created a magical wld where people can escape toBook 1 Harry Potter And The Philosophers StoneThis book is the first  this wonderful series  Harry learns who he isthe boy who lived he makes friends wh ron  hermione he has a great time until he realises someone's tryg to steal the Philosophers stone 's up to him  his 2 mates to STOP THEMBook 2 Harry Potter  the Chamber of SecretsThis book is probably the best wh the flyg cars  howlers  quiddh matches  confrontations  DOBBY oh ui love dobby he is so unusual the endg to the book is really unexpected but you'll have to read the book to fd out what happensBook 3 Harry Potter  The Prisoner Of AzkabanThis book made me cry a teensy bBOO HOO's really sad at the end when Sirius has to leave BOO HOOsee 2nd part of review to see the last part
Unlike the other reviewers I simply thought that this was the wse book  the series maybe the others got caught up  the hype like you i went out  got the book soon as possible heck i pre-dered the book befe  was even done Readg this book was like punishment It felt as  the sty was drawn out The book didnt start to get good until the last couple of chapters  the truly excg part was the last chapter  so Its good to have to complete the series but only f that reason  was a complete disappotment after readg book 3
Harry doesn't seem to underst how to follow the rules does he  It just seems that he always breaks the rules eher by accident of beacuse he thks s the only way to accomplish his goalsI'm glad about the tension between Ron  Hermione  just seems a good counterpot to everythg revolvg around Harrywhat else is there to say?   you like them you're gone this far  the series   not then you probably gave up a while ago so whats the pot of my tryg to convce you to read on?  your loss!!!!!
To beg wh I wasn't so impressed wh this entry After the lean  to-the-pot mystery of Prisoner of Azkaban I was bed to tears wh the potlessly long  empty openg of Goblet of Fire The first 100 pages are the slowest  most bg so far  the Harry Potter books I urge you to skip the first few chapters (up until the badly described  confusg 'riot' at the Quiddch Wld Cup)  get straight to Harry aboard the Hogwarts Express as nothg of terest happens befe this potBut once back at Hogwarts all the usual hi-jks start There is yet another Defense Agast the Black Arts teacher (even weirder this time) the usual hassle from Malfoy rums of Ld Voldemt's return to power cocide wh Harry's scar hurtg but no Quiddch Instead two other Wizard schools (Durmstrang  Beauxbatons) brg their best students to vis f the whole year to participate  the Triwizard tournament A st of Olympic Games f Wizards but only three (chosen by the Goblet of Fire) are allowed to completeBut somehow the Goblet sps out a fourth entry (Harry) givg Hogwarts two chances to w the tournament Much to the annoyance of almost every other student as they all thk he wants to be centre of attention aga But even wse f Harry because he didn't enter the tournament because he didn't want to  he was too young But someone put his name fward  once aga Harry has to risk his le while solvg a dozen mysteriesThis book is nowhere near as fast paced as PoA  sometimes  seems that Rowlg is far too at ease wh her catatonic way of developg the plot I would have preferred   were me concentrated  wasted no time I never felt like I was gettg anywhere wh  no matter how many chapters I read But by the end when the plot threads are tied together ( some left annoygly hangg) the book feels me wholesome but the payoff still doesn't feel as big as  should be f trudgg all the way through a slow sty wh a begng so slow 's almost gog backwardsI sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is betterld be f trudgg all the way through a slow sty wh a begng so slow 's almost gog backwardsI sure hope The Order of the Phoenix is better
Harry Potter  the Goblet  FireHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire by JK Rowlg is a fascatg fantasy   is the best book I have ever read Harry Potter who's parents died when he was a baby Hermione Granger who's parents are muggles  Ron Weasely face the problem of the three tasks when Harry name got put to the goblet of fire Then Harry has to compete agast older wizard than himself All this takes place at the best wizardg school around Hogwarts of Wchcraft  Wizardry This book is perfect f the average middle school kids It has a lot of pages but  goes by fast because  is nonstop action This nonstop action makes you turn page after page  never put the book down If you ask me this is the best book on the planet This book is the fourth book of a five book series You can also fd her other books they are called Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secretes Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban  her new one Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix

I love all the books!! It's funny sad happy  everythg!! I love all the characters!! JK is a great auth I can't wa f the movie of this one
I remember vividly the year 2000 the summer where the anticipation f the fourth book of the Harry Potter adventure fally reached a boilg pot wh s release immediately becomg the fastest-sellg book  histy The book was the longest  the series so far  undoubtedly the most excg F startes the tradional Quiddch championship which Gryffd had won the year previous was cancelled f the Triwizard Tournament which troduced a whole bevy of characters from dferent parts of the wld Quiddch fans get their fix at the begng however at the raucous Quiddch Wld Cup: packed wh colful surroundgs  great details the whole sequence is wrten wh great prose  humourThe three Triwizard tasks are also wrten brilliantly Rowlg seamlessly blendg humour anticipation  dread to each paragraph Ra Skeeter is a new character a despicable journalist who makes le a livg hell f Harry wh fradulant sties another sign of Harry's matury  Rowlg's creasg wldview: journalism problems! No doubt somethg she's experienced sce Harry Potter has become a wldwide phenomenon At almost 700 pages this book never drags  s sections of description as Rowlg contues to captivate us wh her magical wld Surprise a fourth brilliant read
After readg the fth Harry Potter book (that's right) I decided to dulge myself  rereadg the fourth Harry Potter book  I found  much me satisfyg than the fth bookThe character's are posively superb  the plot is smooth  sleek unlike the fth which is thick  bloatedThe plot is expertly revolved around the Triwizard Tournament wh a mystery as an extra layer Very powerful deliverance  fs perfectly wh the rest of the series5-Stars! Another stg ovation f Rowlg Bravo!
As always JK Rowlg has wrten a masterful piece rich  detail  le  That beg said ially I was slightly taken aback by the unhappy endg of this stallment  I sat down wh this book expectg all to end well  Harry to simply return to the rotten Dursley's at number four Privet Drive  In retrospect  was an amazg novel full of marvelous triumphs  heart breakg defeats Rowlg has defely taken the stakes to a new level
Almost everyone knows the basic plot of harry potter books so the matter of terest to me is why  is so movg f the people of the wld Like the old english classics by Dickens  Shakepeare  has transcended the boundaries of nations  languages  And that is the pot I am makg Harry Potter's universal appeal is due to the fact that  depicts an experience that is common to almost all the lerate people of the wld: spendg childhood at school In Harry Potter we see a reflection of ourselves dog all the thgs that we had so deeply desired to do but never could do By makg us relive our school lives  a heroic manner Rowlg touches our memy at a place where our feelg are most strong  tender  We love Harry Potter  associate wh  because he is the embodiment of all we had wanted to be And this association becomes even me strong when we see harry not just baskg  gly but facg troubles  crises  quiverg under the stress  In the Goblet of Fire Harry makes a long protracted mistake of gog further  further to Voldemt's trap What appear to successes throughout the novel turn out to be follies  the end But as Harry is locked to a combat wh Voldemt he once aga rises to the occasion  manages to escape  And so the great Dumnlede becomes aware of Voldemt's return At the end of the novel a great chapter seems to have been opened  magical histy whicn leaves the reader  suspense about what would follow next  I firmly believe that the sole mer of good lerature is that  depicts human nature  s various expression  the face of dferent suations  the fm of thoughts feelgs  much me By accurately describg the school le of a boy faced wh many problems  also gted wh many qualies the Harry Potter Series  particularly the Goblet of Fire mers the tle of Wld Classic
OK I was wrong  I let the really dark turn this book took towards the end make me rank  below The Prisoner of Azkaban but a reread  the ensug reflection found me rankg this above s predecess  Wh the fourth book JK Rowlg turns the Harry Potter series to epic-size proptions  given the recently-released fth book 's somethg that will contue wh Books Six  Seven  In fact the openg chapter of this book hts at what's  ste  The question is when  how?There are two big extra-special events  this book  The first one is the Quiddch Wld Cup where thouss of wizards attend to see Irel play Bulgaria  Harry goes wh the Weasleys  Hermione to this once--a-while gala sptg event which takes place  the woodsHowever mayhem is later caused at the campse when the Dark Mark an emerald skull representg Voldemt's suppters appears  the skyMeanwhile at Hogwarts Dumblede announces the Tri-Wizard competion revived after s dangerous past wh 6th  7th fmers (16-17 year olds) allowed to compete  Qualyg students are told to enter their names to the Goblet of Fire  That elimates Harry who is only a fourth fmer  knowgly does not put his name to the Goblet  You can image what happens right?Many new developments are takg place  Fred  Gege Weasley would rather open up a joke shop much to the chagr of their mother who thk they should be puttg me emphasis on higher education  Dudley Harry's nasty cous is their first victim a la the Ton Tongue Toffee but then aga he deserves   Guess what  does?The character of Ra Skeeter a gossip columnist always lookg f dirt on her subjects who would put Hedda Hopper  Louella Parsons to shame is troduced  Woe be to anyone who crosses her although one would thk the article on Hermione beg Harry's girlfriend though untrue would be a compliment to Harry  Hermione  Along those les Harry  Ron are growg up  They notice beautul women  the fm of veelas sensuous-lookg creatures from Bulgaria wh a Siren-like effectThere's another new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody He's gruff no-nonsense blunt --he even punishes Draco Malfoy  a very funny way-- but he really knows his stuff  the part where he discusses the Unfgivable curses really demonstrates what should really be learnedIn the third book Rowlg ptrayed a conflict between Ron  Hermione due to Crookshanks her cat  This time 's between Harry  Ron  among his peers Hermione is me than ever a beacon of suppt f Harry  his time of need even though havg her as a friend means spendg me time  the library  less talk about Quiddch  Hagrid is also a pillar of suppt as he believes  HarryThe book sets thgs f the next book but is the sty wth the 700+ pages?  Well yes  is!  I recently read an article sayg that the movie f this book might be spl to two movies  If that's the case I wonder  they will film  all at once then stagger the release dates (a la the recent Tolkien trilogy adaptations)  That would still keep terest stoked up  the series  by then the penultimate book will have h the shelves  the third movie out on videmione  Along those les Harry  Ron are growg up  They notice beautul women  the fm of veelas sensuous-lookg creatures from Bulgaria wh a Siren-like effectThere's another new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody He's gruff no-nonsense blunt --he even punishes Draco Malfoy  a very funny way-- but he really knows his stuff  the part where he discusses the Unfgivable curses really demonstrates what should really be learnedIn the third book Rowlg ptrayed a conflict between Ron  Hermione due to Crookshanks her cat  This time 's between Harry  Ron  among his peers Hermione is me than ever a beacon of suppt f Harry  his time of need even though havg her as a friend means spendg me time  the library  less talk about Quiddch  Hagrid is also a pillar of suppt as he believes  HarryThe book sets thgs f the next book but is the sty wth the 700+ pages?

This book is one of my faves  the Harry Potter series Not only is  funny dark  entertag but  the long run---  makes sense! my fave part about this book is how  the end EVERYTHING comes together! nothg goes un-notices  overlooked thgs that didn't make sense fnaly seem perfectly clear mysteries are unfogged  misunderstgs are comprehended wh well put explanations This is as i said my fave Harry Potter book (although i just fished pheonix so we'll have to see) because of the mysterious happengs  the suspenseful plot  so on  is a very entertag  fun book to read although the size may timidate some don't sweat ! you read this book sooo fast i read   3 days because i paced myself because i didn't want  to be over!! i would highly reccomend buyg/readg this book But i would also highly reccomend readg the previous 3 of the series befe h just f some backround knowledge everythg will make a lot me sense  the book will be me enjoyable
This is the best PoTter book so far  I can't wa till the rest of the series is fished
Year 4Like all the other Harry Potter books The Goblet of Fire begs  the summer befe school starts  Harry is livg wh the Dursleys his muggle (non-magical) aunt  uncle  Harry is unhappy livg there but has no choice  Underage wizards cannot use magic  the muggle wld so all Harry can do is send his owl to get messages from his friends Ron  Hermione as well as from his god-father Sirius Black  As the summer wds to a close Harry gets permission to stay wh the Weasley family  Together they go to the Wld Cup of Quiddch which is beg hosted by Engl  The Wld Cup is the extent of Quiddch that we get f the book because of somethg else that is gog on at the school  The Tri-Wizard Championship has returned after a hiatus of centuries (because the fataly rate was far too high)  The Championship is between three magical schools  each school gets one champion  Nobody under the age of 17 may enter  they will be magically prohibed to enter  All names will be entered to the Goblet of Fire which will select the champions  Cedric Diggy (a Hufflepuff Quiddch player) is the Hogwarts champion  The other two are selected  the selections should be overuntil one me name is sp out: Harry Potter  While this was agast the rules Dumblede decided that sce the Goblet of Fire sp out Harry's name Harry must competeThe book follows Harry durg the school year as there are attempts on his le  through the Tri-Wizard Championship (made up of three trials spread out throughout the year)  There is que a b of action  this book  like the others  is a book that once I started readg I didn't want to stop  There are surprises  sadness  everythg  between  JK Rowlg wres so well that the characters are believable as people  even though we know that magic isn't really we can believe   f the duration of the book  Wh each book that Rowlg wres the Harry Potter series gets betterHarry Potter series gets better
I thk that this book is one of the better harry potter books as  gives you a better sight to harry  his crush  also brgs harry ron & hermone closer togetherbut i thk that the new book (Harry Potter & the der of the phenoix) is gog to better as  will show how sirius  snape can wk closer together as voldermt has come back  they are under dumbledes wisheswell that is my iopion on the book so i hope everyone else agreesSam
This is an amazg book wh adventure  exctment though still romantic (a ltle)  funny but sensistive I'm a reader whose loves to read these types of books but lets face  there are hardly any like them! If you're sayg you're to old then you're to stupid to my momloves them Though this book is long  only took me 3 days to read   have read the series over 4 times each Of course you can expect Hermione sayg how much Ron  Harry don't read (but why?)  when Harry here's how much Cedric's dad brags about his son beatg him  how they come face to face aga Cedrick might never see Harry aga  the long sad goodbye though don't expect JKR to come up wh somethg!!!!
I just re-read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire about a month ago  anticipation f the fth book (that is now less than two weeks away)  I was remded of the reasons why the fourth book is my fave so far  the seriesIn Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Harry returns f his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry There are the same friends the same enemies a crush (drama!) plus students  teachers from two other wizardg schools Everyone's at Hogwarts f the return of the Triwizard Tounament - which is the cause f much me of the danger  excement  Harry Ron  Hermione's fourth yearOn the side flap of the hardcover edion the book is called the pivotal fourth novel  f good reason "Goblet of Fire" adds another long-term obstacle (I know that that's too weak of a wd) to the already-developed plotle of Harry  friends' quest to get through their seven years of school Almost me than  does anythg else this novel builds anticipation f now readers have the tiest glimpse of what lies ahead  years five six  seven F this reader  seems like seven books will never be enoughThe plot of Harry Potter 4 is defately darker than the first three  this may be part of the reason I thought  was better JK Rowlg's plots have always been as good f adults as they are f children but the new aspects  this stallment made the book filled wh me emotion  a few me themes that older audiences might identy wh me than the youngIf there's anyone out there left who hasn't read this book don't be timidated by the size In this case me pages just means me fun Anyway I have friends (myself cluded) that were fished on the day that we got  Don't make any excuses to yourself  you've read the first three but are holdg off on this one Read this book If there's anyone out there ( I really hope that there isn't) who are thkg about skippg the first three  startg wh this one break the hab of startg series  the middle  go read "Scer's Stone" It's a terrible hab  I don't know why people do that but I'm sayg  just  caseIf you haven't read  yet enjoy If you have go ahead  read  aga F me at least  was just as good the second timehkg about skippg the first three  startg wh this one break the hab of startg series  the middle  go read "Scer's Stone" It's a terrible hab  I don't know why people do that but I'm sayg  just  caseIf you haven't read  yet enjoy If you have go ahead  read  aga F me at least  was just as good the second time
I can't possible pick a fave among the Harry Potter books My fave tends to be whichever I am readg at the time  Still I've just re-read Goblet ( anticipation of Phoenix)  I am impressed all over aga Rowlg has planned  woven  so many ty details  the earlier books (which at the time just seemed to add "col" to a scene) only to reveal  a later book how each detail is signicant  Also I thought that the Triwizard Tournament was a great tool not only f the "action" but also because  gave the reader an opptuny to learn me about the background of certa characters who would not otherwise have "come up  conversation" at Hogwarts  Aga I'm sure those details will come around aga  a me signicant light  Speakg of which Did anyone else notice that a) The name of the "woman wh all the cats" who used to babys Harry  the first book was "Mrs Figg" AND b) At the end of Goblet Dumblede sends f "Arabella Figg"  Rowlg doesn't do that st of thg by accident  I really enjoy !
Wh each book that comes out  this marvelous series a new adventure awas Each book cannot be called better than the other because of their diversy  great style of wrgHowever f those who have not read this 4th book of the series  opens up whole knew possibilies  the style  creates  holds suspense By usg feshadowg the auth will entrap your md to contue readg  reveal this great fantasy wld which you would wish you were a part of By revealg some parts of the sty she will make you wonder about all the possibilies  you may just stop  thk about the dferent thgs that might happenIf however you were dissaspoted  readg the previous books I seriously suggest buyg this book to improve your judgement of the series My brother hates readg the preivous books he read only a few imptant chapters f school then about half the third but when the fourth came  he wouldn't put  down He went back  read the other books fully  can't wa till the fth arrives I guarantee you will love this book!
JK Rowlgs should have made Harry Potter a trilogy  The first three books at least had a few decent twists  This book is so obvious that Rowlg could have used a footnote  said MAJOR PLOT ELEMENT!  the book would have remaed the same  Even  you like readg long books don't come to Harry Potter  It took me only a day to read this book wh s credibly large font size  If your lookg f a real monster of a book try readg some Tom Clancy novels
As a lover of wrg  readg I have appreciated the subtle nuances of Rowlg's wk I came to read her series because I thought the movies were very sweet  terestg Books 1-3 are very enjoyable  highly entertag however wh this fourth book Rowlgs out did herself I must say that this is one of best books I have ever readI cried laughed  was jumpg off my couch while readg The fact that  is simply done enhances the emotional low  highs JKR's vivid detail is engagg  I couldn't put the book down lerally I started readg f a b of fun  eighteen hours later I was wishg that I had Book 5Unlike JKR's previous novels the "Goblet of Fire" dispenses wh a lot of s redundancy (as explaed by another reviewer) Here the reader is taken to a very large fk  a road  the wld of Wches  Wizards We are given our greatest sight  I was astounded  breathlessI won't give away much of the plot but I will say that everythg is not as  seems f Harry Friendship loyalty  conceived notions are threatened f our young friend Begng wh his ill concealed delight to attend a Wld Cup Quiddch match wh the Weasley's where young Potter is troduced to the varyg wld of wchcraft Yet Voldemt has me  ste f Harry  characters of old  new faces must choose between understg  death I refuse to give away me You will have to buy the book  read f yourselfOn a separate note I am twenty-six year old female  lover of lerature I applaud everyone who even attempted to read this book especially children I don't underst what all the fuss is about but pull your head out the s folks This is a great book emphasis on book It is an imagary wld that is really nothg me then a microcosm of our own Magik is what gives  the spice of le but all the me subtle  fer pots is what brgs  to le When I have children they will defely be readg these sties Matter of fact I may have to speed up the process so I can get started readg agaHappy Readgchildren they will defely be readg these sties Matter of fact I may have to speed up the process so I can get started readg agaHappy Readg
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an excellent excellent book  I would strongly recommend that you read  Even  you didn't like Harry befe you will now ! I have been a fan of Harry f three years  have gaed a lot of knowledge about   that time (cludg the acts who play the lead characters  the movie series - Emma Watson (Hermione) Daniel Radclfe(Harry  Rupert Grt(Ron)  I own the Philosopher's Stone Chamber of Secrets  Goblet of Fire but am still lookg f the Prisoner of Azkaban  Well anyway the magic suspense  delight that awas you  this stallment is thrillg  I cannot wa to see how the acts ptray that !!Cheers !
Everythg that Goliath wrote  his/her review is accurate  And this is still one the best overall books f entertament value I have ever read  I can only believe that Goliath wh all due respect used to wre hate mail to Warner Brothers as a child because Wile E Coyote could never have survived that fall  It's not War  Peace dude seriously
I HAVE READ ALL FOUR HARRY POTTER BOOKS LIKE A GAZILLION BOBILLION MAMILLION BAZILLION TIMES EACH AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE IS DEFENITLY MY FAVORITE IT IS VERY GOOD THE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT WAS EXCITING AND WHEN CEDRIC KILLED BY LORD VOLDEMORT IT WAS EXTREMLY SAD I CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (I THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT) COMES OUT!!!!!!
Very good book  leaves you dyg f me  In this book we go even deeper to the realm of Harry Potter  discover me secrets  wizardry customs  We learn of other schools that teach magic  the pasts of several characters are revealed  The endg leaves you questiong what`s gog to happen next!
I saw the first movie on VHS wh my son  liked the sty  I read the first book then the third (Prizoner of Azkaban)  just fished Goblet of Fire  I need to read Chamber of Secrets befe I see the movieI liked this book f many reasons most of which have already been wrten about by other reviewers here  I did not like all the constant referrg back to previous books  It tends to lose momentum at times  This particular book is dark  dangerous  I found myself unable to sleep at times wryg about po Harry  I guess that is a good dication that even adults can get hooked to these books easilySome wds of advice f readg this series yourself  Read them  der  you can as they build upon each other  Read them  you can particularly Goblet of Fire BEFORE your kids read them because this one  particular has scenes that are me than mildly disturbg  possibly nightmare producg f the younger readerI like the rest of the wld wa patiently f number 5 to arrive!
Pri to his fourth year at Hogwarts School f Wchcraft  Wizardry Harry attends the International Quiddch Cup wh his friends After the excg match Harry  his friends Ron  Hermione hear some rums about events at their school f the comg year but they have to wa until the start of school to fd out specics Harry just wants to be a nmal young wizard but You-Know-Who  his followers are lurkg on the hizon  they brg danger to Harry  ways he never imaged Buildg on her previous three novels Rowlg outshes herself  this fourth book While  is darker  a b me serious than the previous books "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is also well-balanced  fiercely true to s audience I contue to be amazed at Rowlg's stytellg prowess I could hardly put the book down (which I did have to do because  was too heavy) while readg
WOW just fished the book yesterdayTo start off let me say this  The book was long   beg long the auth was able to put a lot of detail to this  Also i did notice that the auth change her wrg style a ltle b by usg some wds that i would not expect anyone  their teen years to understAs far as the book  added a ltle theme of love which was very entertag  seemed suable f younger audiencesAnd as wh every Harry Potter book there was a twist to the sty which i did not get once aga until they explaed  (sigh)ButThis book was soooo dark toward the endg  left me feelg que sad f ltle harry potter  his wld  general  It makes me want to cry&ltPP>There were many aspects to this book such as friendship  many le lessons such as you can never trust anyoneIf you were a fan of the first three i recommend this book to you  you have the timeThis might prove to be a problem though  they make a movie out of  because  was very long but that's another review~hope this helps
This is the best Harry Potter book by far Don't be afraid of the length  goes by very fast I read this book  one day This is a great book series f all ages I am 13 I love them my dad is 42  he loves them

After I read this book I went back  re-read the whole series wh 5 days  This book is fun scary mysterious  sad  Harry Potter is a Hero that only his ner circle of friends  ments can truly know  He sacrices all f the good of everyone else  I'm a Christian  can see this clearly!  What a fantastic role model  I can't wa to read the rest  the series
This book is perfect f any child  adult I loved this book!!!! No wonder  was a new yk times best sellerI couldn't stop readg Ihis book is full of magic I would suggest readers of all ages to read this book!
Ok let's start this book is absolutely great Is the best of the harry potter series I just loved  from the very begg to the fal wd is full of magic  adventure I can't wa f the next one specially f the last wds   I recomend you to buy  you won't regret
I thk Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book  the Harry Potter series  There is me mystery than  the previous 3  sce the characters are growg up  are now 14 they are gog through many changes that us teenagers are gog through today  It has 's happy  sad moments  I would recomend this book to anyone who loves to read  can really get to a good series of books
A great series of books to read aloud to your kids (even  they can read  themselves) Don't be surprised to hear them beg you to "read on! one me chapter! you can't stop now!" Besides you won't md readg these books yourself (why should the kids have all the fun?) We were all dyg to know what will happen next I guarantee you will have a hard time puttg  down I was glad to see Dobby the House Elf back  wonder who might be returng  book 5? I don't believe some of the subplots are as trivial as some people thk  will probably be furthur developed  book 5 This book is a b darker than the other sties The endg should probably not be read right befe bedtime to younger kids This book will take some time to get through but  never seems too long Why do so many people want to cut down a book's pages? Fally book 5 has a release date June 21st see you  le!
No matter y age you'll love this book! However you must be open mded  leave behd the fact that many consider this book "lerature f children only" That was my mistake at first when my younger sister lent them to me I suppose I was  que prejudiced: I didn't read them I skimmed trough the first  decided that they weren't f meHowever after seeg the first movie I realised I might be missg somethg wthwhile At the second (but first serious) try I loved them (so what does that tell us about prejudices?) Now I've read all Harry Potter's books  I love them (I'm anxiously wag f the next one)Anyway I can tell that this one "Harry Potter  the goblet of fire" was the best so far Me action  a deeper development of characters make a wonderful book It is a ltle sad though (one of the characters dies) but at the same time has a lot to teach you about what is imptant  le: values friendshipI would recommend this book f everybody grown-ups (unprejudiced  wh imagation please don't repeat my mistake)  children Each one will read this book  her/his own particular way but all will like   keep  In a wd wthwhile  captivatg
I've read 3 books of Harry Potter Philisopher's Stone Prisoner of Azkaban  Goblet of fire After readg one book after another I never thought somethg me wonderful was comg Goblet of fire is the best so far Lots of new characters new sties new adventures  most especially new twists cludg test on friendship It's a great read deed same goes wh s auth Jk Rowlg is one of the best
I would list negative thgs first usually but this book is entirely posive! All you christian extremist "occult experts" I can come up wh 4 reasons why Harry Potter has nothg to do wh the occult1 He celebrates Christmas2HP spell: lumos Wiccan spell: takes a half an hour to say  even the wkgs of  are all  the spellcasters md3Occultic spells have to be said at a certa time facg a certa direction a magic circle wh a magic cream etcetcetc HP spells are nothg like "real" ones4 HP gets kids to READThese sties are excellent grippg virtueous magical  simply to good to expla  1000 wds  lessHarry Potter rules!
This book was so unbelievably good I just couldn't put  down! It took me about two days to read  just over a week to read the entire 4 books! JK Rowlg is brilliant once aga  her attempt to wre about Harry's 4th year experiences at Hogwarts As always  had tons of drama  mystery  Malfoy's tauntg of Harry makes  an all around excellent book! I can't wa until the 5th book comes out!!
This book is just like the other first three books but this one is me exced This book is darker eviler than the first three books People read this Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire book never thk  is too longbut of course when you first read  you thk this book is like 'oh my god am I ever gog to fish this?' But when you start readg the Chapter one 'The Riddle House' you want to read at least four- five chapters a day And when you fish this book you are so proud of yourself  you're wag f Harry's next adventure<BR>     I recommend you to buy this book!(If you don't have  yet)
I've enjoyed each of the four books so far published  this series  The thg that makes "Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire" such a wonderful book is that  is a superb mystery  We really need the fal chapters where all of the details of what was gog on all along fally come to light  The action of the book makes  also a superb page-turner  I couldn't wa to fd out what would happen next  The fact that  is set agast the backdrop of a wld of wizards  wches gives such a unique settg f the mystery to she  Rowlg's characters are also so wonderfully human from the pompus Bagman to the cool Krum to jealous Ron down to Moang Myrtle who turns up whenever Harry gets close to a body of water be  the bathtub  lake!  The fal dual between Harry  U-Know-Who is credibly sustaed tension  Rowlg has done a wonderful job like Agatha Christie at wdg the mechanism of the mystery up so tightly we wce  then lettg  sp out facts to expla the mystery as Dumblede patiently listens to Harry's account of the duel  This is an exquise thriller  The lessons of loyalty friendship  focusg on the truth are superb lessons that resonate wh children  adults alike  Don't miss this modern classic!
Thkg of superlatives f J K Rowlg's Harry Potter series is becomg me  me dficult (because everythg has already been said thouss of times)!  Tryg to give a unique review is also becomg harder  harder  This is another absolutely stupendous book  I really loved readg  Harry has returned to Hogwarts f his fourth year after a fun vis wh the Weasleys  a terryg experience at the Wld Cup (markg the return of the death eaters)  Quiddch is not beg played this year-- s place is a rigous competion known as Tri-Wizard Tournament  Only one contestant is selected from each of three wizardg schools wh the stipulation beg that the student must be seventeen  Unsurprisgly fourteen year-old Harry's name is also pulled out of the "Goblet of Fire"  Thus begs his solary voyage  Wh a few exceptions Harry must make this journey alone through much of this novel  He even becomes estranged from his best friend Ron (Hermione does rema close to Harry)  The other students make fun of him  even igne him The cruelty of the Slythers is the nastiest  Many of the thgs that Harry goes through are the same as what most teens must endure as part of the growg up process  Unftunately Harry does not have the benef of lovg parents to give him some must needed suppt so he turns to his godfather his friends  even a few professs  This book is much darker  sadder than the first three books but as  the others the wrg is so beautul that you will feel Harry's pa  As always Harry triumphs  the end but even this conclusion is btersweet
I have read all the Harry Potter books  have loved them! They were easy to read  held such a great sty However this last attempt was hrible It seemds like the auth was distracted while wrg  which made the book suffer wh a convuluted (sp) sty le Hrible I couldn't wa to fish  It just didn't flow didn't keep my attention  didn't really seem to have anywhere to go When Harry becomes predictable the magic is gone I can only hope the auth fds her w to cast a spell on the fth year  brg back the wonder of Harry Potter  his friends
This book is great It defely is a lot darker  somewhat scarier than the pri stallments but still just as fabulous  captivatg I would not recommend this book f children younger than 10 years of ageRowlg still brgs you to the magical wld of Hogarts just like she did  the pri books
Upon hearg that Goblet of Fire was over 700 pages long many people exclaimed that children would not read   It's too long they said  But read  they have  Perhaps because  was no dferent than readg two of the first three books  Whatever the reason volume 4  the Harry Potter series is as much of a page turner as the precedg 3This tale opens as usual wh the bane of Harry's existence:  the Riddle house  It moves to the Quiddch Wld Cup where omous events occur then as is usual to Hogwarts  Just when the reader is ready to settle to the familiar wld of wch  wizard schoolg Rowlg disrupts everythg wh the Triwizard Tournament  Thus enter a host of new characters  new fmation on what  means to be a wizardBy far the darkest of the series Goblet of Fire moves the sty of Harry's growg up  education along  And at 14 the nmal human side of him is maturg too  Along wh the fantasy elements comg of age  tradional English school boy sty le a new element has been added:  young romanceSome readers may be put off by the darkness of this stallment of the Harry Potter saga  Others might fd the book over long some me detailed edg would have solved that  Still this is a satisfyg contuation of the saga  The book also contues the wonderful task of gettg America's young people to read  There are so many books out there that children  young adults might enjoy such as "Stm Warris" by Elisa Carbone  the Catwgs sties by Ursula LeGu
When I first set my eyes upon this book I was daunted by the size  I soon set aside my unbelief  opened up the book  From the very first page I was already hookedJK Rowlg displays amazg wrg skills targettg young adults as well as children  However  you are an adult do not fear this book will surely also enterta you  Although at first the sty seems simple  becomes very deep  complex Wh so many twists  turns Harry Potter 4 will surely keep you on the edge of your seatThe idea behd Harry Potter 4  the Goblet of Fire is very igal  A sty about wizardy & wchcraft this book just flourishes wh igaly  JK Rowlg deserves much praise f thisSo dig  your pockets go to your nearby bookste  purchase this extravagant book  I assure you you will not be dissapoted
I could not put this book down: I read  f two days straight! It was imagative wty  suspenseful just as you would expect from any JK Rowlg/Harry Potter book The endg wasn't happy as they usually are but I am dyg to read the next addion to the series! I recommend this to any preteen who enjoys science fiction  magical thgs!
"Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is probably the best  the Harry Potter series so far It is extremely dark  provides an adventure wh me histy  fmation about the magical wld  the meag of good vs evilPLOT SUMMARY: Fourteen-year-olds Harry Ron  Hermione are exced when Arthur Weasley gets prime seatg tickets to the International Quiddch Wld Cup After their excg  tense trip to the Cup they return to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry f their fourth year Harry is exced about competg  Quiddch f the House Cup but is disappoted when he learns Quiddch has been canceled due to the ternational school Triwizard Tournament competion that volves three magical schools competg agast each other  magical  dangerous tasks There are three Champions  the wner receives the Triwizard Tournament trophy  one thous galleons You must be at least seventeen years old to compete so Harry thks he doesn't have a chance But when his name is mysteriously picked from the Goblet of Fire which reveals who the Champions from the three schools will be Harry has no choice but to competeeven though there is already another Hogwarts Champion Now wh the help of Ron  Hermione 's up to Harry to complete the three tasks whout makg himself look like a complete fool  front of everyone Ltle does he know that this is all just a set up to brg back one of the darkest Lds  the histy of magicOVERALL THOUGHTS: I've read all four Harry Potter books to-date  this is defely the best one yet It is full of suspense  complex twists/plots There is still some of JK Rowlg's wty igal sense of hum but sce "Goblet of Fire" is me dark there is less  this is a me serious novel It is very tense  dark the climax is pretty frighteng f young childrenso parents beware: you might want to read this wh your very young children  wa until they are a ltle older to be able to underst everythgIf this is what "Goblet of Fire" is like I can only hope f better wh "Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix" Once aga JK Rowlg has amazed us wh her wrg skills  mastered the art of wrg a fantastic novelI highly recommend "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire"Sce:100/100A+wa until they are a ltle older to be able to underst everythgIf this is what "Goblet of Fire" is like I can only hope f better wh "Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix" Once aga JK Rowlg has amazed us wh her wrg skills  mastered the art of wrg a fantastic novelI highly recommend "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire"Sce:100/100A+
This book is so excg  gives the old He-who-must-not-be-named sties a new twist Unprediciable  full of turns  twists that will make you wonder how anyone could thk of  this is a stant classic Every charact has a sty every one creeper than the last  so complex too A another great fantasy wh a touch of mystery
Don't let the length of this book timidate you the adventure  will take you on is well wth the long read  But Muggles (non-magic people f you laymen) beware this book is defely PG 13  If you are concerned about your children readg somethg you may not deem appropriate please read  yourself befe you h  over to the kids  This is a great book which captures the imagation  takes  on a rollercoaster ride to remember
Right now I am on page 709  I thk Mad-eye Moody is what made this book better than nmal I thk  is the best so far of all the 4 books I do look fward to the 5th  hope  has another mad-eye moody type person  the book Thanks JK Rowlg!!!
Harold Potter is at  aga  This as you may know is the fourth stallment from PK Rowlg  as you have come to expect/fear  captures her mystical sense of "hay-laiden fantasy/comedy"  The Goblet of Fire is much me violent  racy (no not rascist) than the others  the series  Here young Harold is fced to steal back the Goblet of Fire from Yic  rega his champion-like status of the broom-game thg  His buddeng sexualy makes this the most excg  awkward of the Harold Potter series  Harry is tn between his "tradionally natural" love  attraction toward Hermione (pronounced Her-Me-Own) meanwhile his nards lustfully drive him towards that blonde dude  The endg is the same as the other sties but the revolutionary aspect of this the IV  the series is that the begng casts off the shackles of tradional prose  is comprised mostly of fart jokes  Magic Harold!  Magic!
This book is simply amaizg I liked this sty better than the other ones because I thk is gettg darker  complex while the kids (Harry Ron  Hermione) are gettg older In my opion this is not a good book f kids The thgs that you have to go through the book  specially the end are really scary shockg  darkWh the people that wrote that JK Rowlg is gettg out of track wh this book are wrong  my opion She is wrtg the sty of a boy growg  a magical environment  facg death while he grows Of course the first books are gog to be lighter to read even thought they have some darkness but is understable that she is gog to contug addg dangers  the followg booksJK Rowlg  my opion is a genius of the wrg She blends the sty perfectly among all the books Everythg fs together every caracter is imptant  has a reason  she will keep amaizg us wh the rest of her books
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far my fave of the four published books  this series F readers who thought that Harry had grown a lot  the third book the fourth book shows even me how much he is maturg  growg up Harry still fds that there is a lot about the wizardg wld that he doesn't know but he is learng  growg every dayIn the fourth book Harry gets his chance to see a professional Quiddch game f the first time--at the Quiddch Wld Cup! The Weasleys have ved him to go wh them which also means that Harry gets to leave the Dursleys sooner than he had expected Harry loves watchg the professional teams  seeg so many wizards  wches  one place together but two thgs upset the end of the night f everyone: a group of Death Eaters appear followers of Voldemt  Voldemt's Dark Mark is conjured  the sky--by Harry's w which he had lost sometime durg the nightDespe the appearances of these thgs Harry's return to Hogwarts is filled wh excement when the students learn of what will be comg up durg the year at their school Harry soon fds himself wrapped up  the events though he is below the required age limSirius is convced that someone is after Harry  put his name to the drawg themselves Wh all of the feign students teachers mistry members  repters runng around Hogwarts Harry can't figure out who may be tryg to get him killed Harry is determed to show the person that he can get through the tasks ahead aliveAlso wh this book me is revealed about Hagrid's past  Harry discovers the identies of several Death Eaters Voldemt returns  Harry faces a battle wh him meetg the ghosts of his parents durg the eventsThis book always leaves me cryg at the end There are deaths of nocent people  this book possibly preparg us f me to come  later books Harry matures rapidly  The Goblet of Fire becomg a much older  wiser Harry at the end than he was when we first jo him at the begnghe Goblet of Fire becomg a much older  wiser Harry at the end than he was when we first jo him at the begng
I loved this book It was my favtie out of all the Harry Potter books This is the book out of all four packed wh the most excment  tesy It has a great plot  I love the sty le It had great  excg new characters I loved almost the whole book It had everythg you could ever want  a book Romance adventure action  secrets It is the best
I loved this book It was my favtie out of all the Harry Potter books This is the book out of all four packed wh the most excment  tesy It has a great plot  I love the sty le
In opion I  found this sty to be really good  f one reason 1) is that they put you on the edge of your seat towards the end of the sty  If there is one that can be said about the endg  you gotta to wonder what happens  the rest of the series 
This is one of the longest books I have ever read but trust me stick wh !  I've read  13 times up to date (Ha!! Profess Trelawney!  And you thought 13 was unlucky)!!  The first 158 pages are wh the Dursleys  Don't wry 's still very terestg  Then yet another schoold year begs wh yet another adventure  I will not reveal what is gog on but I will say this "They had to cancel the event  recent centuries do to the high death toll"  Only three were to be picked  then there were four  Then me begs to happen strange thgs are revealed  Harry discovers me about his strange  abnmal past  Then comes "Please let  be dead oh god please let  be dead" Harry thought to himself  And then comes "Don't wry your mother will be comg along anytime now Harry"  This is by far the most eventful of the 4 books yet published  I hope you enjoy  as much as I did!
This is by far the best book  the series In this book they don't have a Quiddch tournament they have a far better kd of tournament If you though Harry got hurt  the last book what  tell you read this book Harry learns of two people that he never thought would be volved wh Voldemt Harry shows great courage  this book His defense of dark arts teacher is another werido I would rate this the 1 book  my opon All  all i can not wa f the next book  this series to come out
Harry Potter has become one of the best sellg charecters of all time due to 's fun  lighthearted style However the Goblet of Fire sets a new tone: darker me dangerous- better Maybe I just like dark tones  Yeah that's probably  However I don't thk that's all It's also longer then pri books clockg  at me then 700 pages I read   one day It's just that good It's nice to see a book mature wh you (by comparison the Redwall series  anythg is lighter then when  started) The darkened tone makes me anticipate me the fth book me then any of the last four I only hope that the Order of the Pheonix is even longer
I would rate this book a five because  is a true example of leadership  stg up f what is right but at the same time excg  fun  In this book  shows Harry's true talents at extreme level f he is  a very big event  That was brought back from years  years ago  In this book a person you would never expect gets a job at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry In addion you will figure out  Sirius (Harry's Godfather) is a full fillg his duties as a godfather<BR>        In edion Harry's wst enemy's come a lot bigger than any of the other books  If you won't get the most out of this book you should read the other three first  Overall  you are a good reader  like adventure  a mystery all rolled to one this is the book f you
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is(so far) the best Harry Potter novel  It follows Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts school of Wchcraft  Wizardry  The sty starts of  "Ltle Hangleton"  The villagers who live there called the Ltle aboned house on the Hill the Riddle house even though the The villagers havd moved there fty years ago  The novel like the others are mysterious scary heroic  magical just like the others  And as the others Rowlg has athe same charm to whisk you out of the muggle wld  to the wonderous wld of Hogwarts School of Wch Craft  Wizardry  The novel also troduces new chracters to the Harry Potter univere such as John Riddle Cho-Chang etc  So  you want to be whisked to a wld of magic than I reccomend you read the Harry Potter series  JK Rowlg is a very gted young wrer  this novel proves   ENJOY!!!!!!  ~Dan~
I love these books  can read them over  over especially this one which is very true to the style fmed  the first book but also dferent  that the plot wrg is not stuck  a fmulaic system like some book series can get to especially many children's books series I am so happy that f once a super popular book is actually somethg that is well wrten  not an sult to the telligence  one's aesthetic sensabily Thank God somethg clicked  people's heads that they are willg to exple  challenge themselves a ltle b me beyond stupid love sties  potless  poly wrten action/adventure books This 4th book has defely many thgs that deserve the greatest compliments as you can surely see  probably all reviews The most telligent scenario Rowlg has conceived so far  these 4 books  my opion is when Harry is under his visibily cloak trapped  the stairs  front of Snape  Filch  Moody helps him  fds out about the marauders map Only close to the end of the book you realize why this moment when Moody is lookg at the map  front of Harry was such a crical one what was at stake what was really gog on there No doubt fascatg imagation  lessons Rowlg has displayed  shared  these Harry Potter books Thanks f thatI spent a waste of time readg one two  occacationally three star reviews Not one of them said somethg that is realistic  supptive of what they try to say Those are some most common one star reviewers reason(s):1 Harry has no depth (as well as other charaters)- They are very rich  personaly Snape flexg his hs every time he looks at Harry as  wantg to strangle him is an example2 It is predictable- WARNING DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK Can these people honestly say they knew  suspected Crouch's son was alive???

I am a few years up from the target age level f this book but still picked up a copy  was just as impressed  gripped by the skill behd this book as I was f the first three books  This book is another gem from Rowlg who managed to diplace my fears that this book would have another happy endg She manages to keep all of the elements of Harry's magical wld that we all love so much  add to  by givg us me glimpses of the wizardg wld outside of Engl wh the Quiddch Wld Cup  even added specialized moves  terms  the game self She proved herself equal to the task of addressg the serious issue of the death of a student  the rise of everyones' greatest fear whout makg the plot seem melodramatic  silly She is  addion to that teachg a serious lesson at the end about puttg aside prejudgices  all that good stuff like she nmally does Not to mention she has challenged her readers to accept the fact that even a fourteen year old wizard can have dark times  his le Good luck to her on the fth  better luck to those who sist on makg movies out of the books
The best of the Harry Potter series (so far)  even me so  you've read the previous 3Often thought of as a kid's book the Harry Potter series also makes f entertag light readg f adults  Though volumous the books can be read quickly takg only a day  two of focused readg
Me brilliant albe simple wrg from Rowlg By simple meang 's not pretentiously overwrten like many of the books that NPR likes to highlight but not simple like a meangless romance novel  other such tre entertament I love these books  can read them over  over especially this one which is very true to the style fmed  the first book but also dferent  that the plot wrg is not stuck  a fmulaic system like some book series can get to especially many children's books seriesI am so happy that f once a super popular book is actually somethg that is well-wrten  not an sult to the telligence  one's aesthetic sensabily - I am so amazed at this because so few people seem to ever exhib any telligence  aesthetic sensibily that the cynic  me would assume that this series would have failed on the first book f beg not-stupid-enough f the mass audience Thank God somethg clicked  people's heads that they are willg to exple  challenge themselves a ltle b me beyond sipid love sties  potless  poly wrten action/adventure books This book is also not only f children but f adult as wellThere riddles  clues that would give hts of whats comg people will have fun guessg the "bad guys" even  you would get  wrong
I PURCHASED THE BOOK FOR MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER SHE LOVED IT
I ade the Harry Potter series  was sad at the conclusion of the book because there is no book 5 yet  If you like Harry Potter you will love this book - 's as simple as that
The plot DID seem to meer a b but  was still a fun read Nothg was too mature  offensive f the Young Adult crowd but the feign students were a tad to ept to be real The tone did sht to a much darker mood  this book but that should be just fe  this is the setup f the remag booksI just read  Cescape (#64 September 2002) that the fth book is slated f June 2003  is currently called "Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix" I hope this is the fal tle  we don't see any changes between the Great Bra  US marketEnjoy!
Wow  JK Rowlg has firmly established herself as a classic auth wh the first four books of this fully-volvg seriesYear Four picks up as usual wh Harry  summer break from Hogwart's school  The book's length comes from here whereas nmally the students return wh the first 75 pages  takes a good 200 to get through the summer  But the summer is fun cludg the Quiddch Wld CupRowlg contues her saga of beg able to completely capture her audience wh this book  I was completely absbed at times on the edge of my seatIn the tradion of the last three books there is a satisfyg twist  the endg of this book  The second is still my fave of the series but this one loses no charm  However the series is takg a steady dark spiral  (You'd have to read  to underst there is no way I'm givg away what happens)  The last few chapters f lack of a better way to say  creeped me out  Rowlg is such a masterful sty teller I was right there wh Harry through an credibly harrowg experience one that I would not like to envision aga  The sty is great   left me exced f the fth book  Once aga there are new characters troduced that are eccentric enough to be real but magically out of the dary enough to be completely unbelieveable  Of course the Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher once aga steals this role  the novel I can't wa to see where this sty gets taken  In the hs of this capable wrer I am extremely exced to see what will happen as Harry Potter grows to the wizard he will become
Rowlg tells sties better than many (me obscure  "grown-up"  thus "me valid/lerary") auths Her control of an tricate plot leaves me amazed as do her characters The Harry Potter universe is one  which I would not md livg  only to see the filigreed relationships develop  real le I am sad when each book ends but I cry every time I fish this one
This book is one of my faves along wh the other Harry Potter Books  the Ld of the Rgs Because of s length You are shown areas never expled  any of the previous books This book exples the uneasy  nervous area of first dances  askg someone to the ball! It also has me action scenes than Books One  Two The plot thickens  the sty is much darker  gives off the feelg that  is ensnared  secrets yet to be uncoveredAlthough this em is recommended to children under 12 I thk this book is a wonderful read f all ages At thirteen I thoughurly enjoyed this book as did my friends My Parents enjoyed readg  wh my younger sister My mother was hooked  would read chapters ahead while my sister fell asleepDon't be wried about how long  seems By the end of  you'll wish there were twice as many pages I fished me  one day! keep  md though that I am addicted
Though the longest Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was my fave  the Harry Potter series thus far It was darker  less childish than the previous three books  the characters especially Harry  Hermione experience tremendous growth throughout the sty I didn't want this book to end The Dursley's rema as awful as ever  the Defense Agast the Dark Arts posion contues to be surrounded wh mystery  Dumblede's wisdom  goodness still prevail at Hogwarts Yet new characters are troduced the relationships between Harry Ron  Hermione change  Harry Potter faces me dficult  creative challenges than ever befe This book also left several questions unanswered settg  up perfectly f the next  the series Defately read !

As the tular character grows older so to do the sties become darker  Many people complaed about the way this book was wrten  about 's surprisgly violent (surprisgly not excessively) fale  However f the sty to progress as a whole  must happen  After all how scary is a villa that never causes any actual damage?  I don't want to give away much of the sty but I'd like to pot out some thgs I fd terestg  First 's amazg to me how realistically Miss Rowlg hled the distresses of askg a girl on a date  When Harry  Ron have to fd partners f the dance they have a sufficiently dficult time at   One thg I know beg a b of a social misf is that the oppose sex is very perplexg  Also a key theme of the Goblet of Fire seems to be paternal relationships  Dumblede to Harry Harry's Godfather (I'm not sayg his name) to Harry Crouch to his son Voldemt to his most loyal Death Eater Voldemt to Wmtail Arthur Weasley to his sons Crouch to Percy (to a lesser extent) Mr Diggy to Cedric also Malfoy's Crabbe's  Goyle's fathers all make an appearance Family is a strong theme  this particular book  makes f some particularly poignant scenes Maybe I'm strectchg there but  seems a strong theme  I was moved by this book genuely moved  As f those who attack adult fans of the Harry Potter books f what 's wth I am an english maj  college  I underst that Harry Potter isn't Faulkner  Heller (two personal faves) but 's not supposed to be  Harry Potter is a fun sty meant to enterta not necessarily to enlighten  I suggest some people try lighteng up be happy kids are readg  revel  the fact that  a wld that can sometimes be all too dark people can fd somethg to enjoy  After all  you can't enjoy le what's the pot  Really What Else Is There?
I thk that this book is the best out of the four that are out  I couldn't put  down once I started readg   I read the entire book over night!
Sry I cannot jo the lovefest on this one I have read all four Harry Potter books This one is f certa not as good overall as books 1  2 Maybe 's only me but I could have swn I was not readg the real JK Rowlg There seems to be a few dferent styles of wrg imatg her style  this book a few dferent "ghost wrers" (no pun tended) And although there are about 200 pages that held my attention the rest of the 700 some odd pages were bg at times If like me however you have read the other books you probably won't hear of my sayg what I have said  will want to read book 4 anyway I don't blame you Still I am lookg fward to see what they come up wh next  book 5 While I'm wag I read another book about a Harry which is not sties of magic wchcraft  wizardry but true real-le sties from civilization's past presented wh the framewk of a fantasy So  like me you like fantasies while we're wag to see what "Harry Potter" gets to next you'll probably want to read "West Pot: Character Leadership" by Nman Thomas Remick It's really que good ----  even educational at that
I loved this one  Wh the Quiddch Cup  the Triwizard Cup  It ends wh an unexpectg twist  I read   only 1 1/2 weeks!  You are sure to love !
I have read this book at least five times It is a good book but I liked the other Harry Potter books better It is a huge 734 paged book I read   2 days The book is about Harry (who else) who gets picked as the fourth champion  the triwizard tnament Throughout the book he has to pass all the 3 tasks  not dieIt is a terric book  I reccomend  to everyone at all ages to read
This is defately the best of the Harry Potter books  It is excg  brgs the characters to a new level  Although  is over seven hundred pages long  is a fast read  The length is needed because there is so much me gog on  the characters lives  You won't want to put the book down It took me about four days to read f that very reason  I am a slow reader  I loved this book  I would recommend to people of all ages but be sure to have read the other three books  you won't underst some parts
I started readg this book on openg day  I was on a trip to the UP of Michigan  I knew  was openg day f this book but I didn't thk I was gog to be able to fd  anywhere  I went to a local bookste  ironwood  there was one copy left  I bought   read  f about two days stra  was my fave book I can't wa f the next stallment  the series  I highly recomend

I was very late to the Harry Potter rush  When I had ially heard about the "ltle kids books" volvg Harry Potter I thought Potter was the auth  Only once the movie came out did I start readg the books  I lerally couldn't put them down  I read all 4 books  about 3 weeks total  I'm now readg them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old who of couse doesn't get  all but loves them anywayTrust me these books are absolutely fantastic!  As long as you're between the ages of 4  114 you will love them!
This book is the greatest yet  the much acclaimed Harry Potter series  JK keeps us guessg up until the last of the 734 pages  Harry gets a peek at quiddch at s top level  we fd an old friend has come back to Hogwarts  Who is the agent of Voldemt at Hogwarts?  Will there be death at this year's Triwizard Tournament?  I bet you know exactly where to fd out
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far the best stallment yet! If  were alright to practice wchcraft I would defenatly go to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry But I'm American so I guess I couldn't This book might look long but once you reach the end you just want  to magically keep gog  gog  gog You actually get disappoted because  ended so soon The only thg I didn't like about this book is that a good character died I actually cried while readg that part  I've never cried while readg a book befe accept f one other time And I would most defenanty not want to be  the Tri-Wizard Tournament Well I don't know I could always go to the Hospal Wg  have Madam Pomfrey heal me right up! And I'd also like to meet a Vella I just wouldn't want to make her mad!
The ma reason that i liked this book was that  was really long It's the kd you can just read f hours on end And the plot while kd of confusg at times was still the best after the 1st  2nd book  the series I did like the twist wh Moody at the end  the duel wh Voldemt(somethg i missed  the 3rd book) while  was kda sad at the end  still had all the suspense a good book needs Congratulations JKR on your best book yet!
The fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series is arguably the best one yet  In this modern classic Harry heads f Hogwarts once aga to beg his fourth year where he learns of an amazg competion - the Triwizard Tournament - a competion between three wizardg schools  Three champions are selected from the Goblet of Fire to compete f their school  three tasks - which will test their highest ws  The three champions are drawn as well as a fourth - Harry Potter himself!  Will Harry Potter survive the tournament?  Fd out  this marvelous book from popular auth JK Rowlg!  One of the reasons fans like this book so much is that there is a lot gog on  Hermione ganizg SPEW (an ganization to protect house elves agast lab) the Yule Ball the rude repter Ra Skeeter ETC ETC ETC  We also get to see other wizardg schools - Durmstrang  Beauxbatons  Don't fget to read this wildly popular book!
This is one of the best books I have ever read!  It's the best Harry Potter Book  the Series!  It seems that the books get bigger  better each time  If you want to buy this book buy !  It is a wonderful read even  you absolutely hate readg  Although 's the longest book  the series  seems to be super-sht  I highly highly highly reccomend this book whether you're a child  an adult  I also would reccomend you to read the other three books first because then you'll underst the "Magical Wld of Harry Potter" me  If you thk readg all of these books will be hard you should probably buy the Harry Potter books on cassettes  compact discs so you can listen while beg volved  other activies!!!  I am also very exced f the 5th book to come out  I hope you read( listen) to this superb book!!!  §§§Enjoy!!!§§§
This book is the best  the series! I never was terested  readg until about the fourth grade (I'm now  7th) The first book I really got to was Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone By the time I picked up "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" I couldn't put  down! The characters are perfect f the parts  there is nothg negative to say about this enchantg book I read   only 4 days! Don't miss this great book fd because of 's length because  has such a wonderful plot that  goes by too fast I've read  4 other times sce while awag JK Rowlg's next book  the series "Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix" I recommend this book to children  adults alike!

The longest book until now  the Harry Potter's series takes the reader once aga to new ls  the complex wld wrten by Rowlg Harry will now face his wst enemy: Voldemt durg the Tri- Wizard Tournament Rowlg also cludes a "development" on the feelgs of Harry Ron  Hermione The troduction of new characters (required by the Tri-Wizard Tunament  the Quiddch Wld Cup) brg to the sty new hizons while we wa f the fth book of the series An obligated question is on the air: What will happen on the 5th book? I hope Rowlg's wld to get exped me action (is  possible to have me action after "The Goblet of fire"?)  why not the young love  Hogwarts Sry f the quiddch fans  this book but check up the Quiddch Wld Cup fal match prepare to read the excg  hazardous Tri- Wizard tournament tasks get ready f the upcomg of Voldemt  the Death Eaters  New charatersnew fearsnew enemies me action me risks  love is what you will fd  this book : Harry Potter  the goblet of fire Wa up to the fth!
This book was so credibly amazg! After readg book three of the Harry Potter series I thought  coudn't get any better! But I was wrong In Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts the sty (while sometimes a b confusg) is wonderful  the best yet from JK Rowlg This book is great f kids  adults alike!
As I have loved all previous books  the series I also loved this book!  This is another book that you just can't put down  I found my self wishg that I could go to Hogwarts  become a REAL wch  These aren't just books f kids this is a good read f the 40-somethg crowd of which I am a member!
All of those pages are there f a reason In the fourth book you really get to know how the magical wld wksHermione's got a boyfriend Hermione's got a boyfriend! And you wouldn't believe who  is!The book is all about the Triwizard tournament where representatives from Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstang magic students compete You heard right there are other schoolsYou know who comes back stronger than ever  this one Hold on to your seats I still can't wa f the next book!
What I've enjoyed most about Rowlg's Potter series is the cozy feelg I get readg them--like stg  an English pub on a chilly eveng there's this warm camraderie between Harry  his friends a sense of secury at Hogwarts wh s rules  tradions  authy figures that somehow survive the tweakg that s resident scholars flict  heart-of-gold characters like Hagrid  Dumblede  Mrs Weasley warm you on the side like steamg bowls of MulligatawnyBut now Harry's 14 old enough to be iated to evil res snatched from the safety of a school game to a le--death struggle  a graveyard The stakes are no longer a Quiddch championship but wld domation by the powers of darkness  one student even dies  the contest In light of the events of 9/11/01 perhaps American readers are me sensive to the "change  the weather" that Potter  his peers are bracg f at the end of "Goblet of Fire" I fd myself awag Vol 5--like tomrow's headles--wh some rrepidation
This is the best Harry Potter yet Simply an amazg book you cannot put down What else can be said?! A must must read! Also recommend Shade of the Maple by Kirk Mart - second only to Harry Potter f me!!
"Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" has got to be JK Rowlg's most enthrallg novel  her wld-famous Harry Potter series to date  I do believe that she put fth me efft than she did to her 3 previous novels makg this one the absolute best  It's amazg how you can s down wh this thick 734 page book  read  only a couple of stgs!If I were to grade this book I would give  an automatic A+ based on JK Rowlg's unique wrg style  It's great how she has wrten  so that all the maj events  the sty seem to tie  together  make the sty so trigug  So follow my advice: READ THIS BOOK!  You will not regret !
I read the 4th Harry Potter book this year followg the others I'd say this was THEE best book so far I believe that the Harry Potter series is just gettg better  better I usually don't read books me than once because you already know what happens  loose terest not this book I'm currently readg  aga <BR> This book is about 14-year-old Harry Potter returns to school  becomes a part of a famous competion Many amazg feats take place <BR> The only thg disappotg about this book is the fact that he does not play Quiddch this year<BR> I fd myself wantg to be a wizard  attendg Hogwarts A very good book! I recommend  f all ages
I ade the latest Harry Potter tale It needed to be as long as  was drawg together the 3 previous books wh fmer sties Sirius Black house elves Cho Dudley's pig tail even Ron's fake cough of "Lockhart"! absolute genius I'm currently livg  Argenta  so many thgs about the Harry Potter series remds me of Bra particularly the feasts the way that the characters talk exactly like people (particularly teenagers)  Bra  the Brish sense of humour I'm pg f the next book to come outIf you love Harry Potter you will love The Price of Immtaly by CM Whlock 's a must read f any fantasy fan
In the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series the sty takes a darker  me serious turn  Harry Potter is growg up  the danger that he faces is as sister as  is real  The sty revolves around a competion between the various Wizardg schools Hogwarts Beaubaton  Durmstrang  a plot by "You-Know-Who" to (surprise!) kill Harry Potter As always the new characters are delightful  as believeable as ever  The plot twists will keep you guessg ( as usual your guesses as to who the villian is will be wrong) as you learn me about Harry's past ( the past of others - such as Dumblede  Snape f example)  Yet  there is a darkness to this book which may be off-settg to some  There are stmclouds gatherg on the hizon  trouble is afoot  Nonetheless I am confident you will love this book as much as the others
I have read all four books  I found Book 4 to be somewhat of a disappotment The plot was me scattered than that of the first three books I also found the imagery to be gy I do not thk the book is suable f pre-teensIn addion as an adult reader I found  frustratg that this particular book was not carefully eded There are numerous spellg  grammar errs that can be irratgAside from the abovementioned shtfalls this book as well as the earlier books is imagative  sts out as a book wth readg
When the Harry Potter series first came out I was like "Pssht what idiocy!" (I was 7 at the time so  was me like "that's stupid") They didn't appeal to me at all even when my friends started readg them It was around 1999-2000 when I actually started to read them My friend who had all 4 books at the time told me I had to read them  they were hard to put down so (wh a very skeptical md) I started Harry Potter  the Scer's Stone Let me tell you at first I thought she was WROONNNGGGG I began the book  got to about chapter 3 when I decided I didn't want to read  anyme so I stashed  under my bed After my friend kept sayg "Are you done YET????" I fally decided to fish the book so I could give  back to her plus my other friend Stephanie told me  got me terestg around the middle So I began readg  found out that Stephanie was smarter than I thought I read the book  immediately afterwards I ran to my friends house  browed the second  the third after I had fished the third my 3 best friends Kaylathe one who lent me the books Stephanie  Julia told me the 4th was the best I quickly browed the fourth  devoured the book  a matter of 3 days I LOVED IT To me  WAS the absolute BEST of the 4 Then after gettg bed wag f the 5th book I read the whole series aga  when I got to the fourth well let's just say my new faves are the 2nd  3rd I still love the whole series of course but I thk when you read the 4th book the 2nd time  loses 's appeal (namely because the first time you read  's new  excg but the second time you know every sgle detail) All  all I rate this book a 5 It's awesome  you should all go out  read the series
I've read all the Harry Potter books  der  I have to say that "The Goblet of Fire" is probably the best by far I'm sure books five six  seven will be even better than this onebut out of all the books that are available right now this one is  "The Goblet of Fire" has a very dark twist to   's about 734 pages long! But  only took me about three days to read THAT'S how good  was!In "Goblet of Fire" our boy wizard hero Harry Potter is 14 years old Not only is he gog through puberty but he's also discoverg that maybe girls aren't as bad as he thought they were has got his eyes on one particular Hogwarts student known as Cho Chang Befe gog back to Hogwarts though Harry is ved to go to the Quiddch Wld Cup game wh Ron Weasley  his family Sce Harry's never had the chance to go to one he manages to get his Uncle Vernon to let him gothis means that his uncle aunt  cous won't have to deal wh him f the rest of the summer After some strange encounters at the Quiddch Wld Cup camp se where Harry  the Weasleys are stayg at Harry Ron Hermione Fred Gege  Gny all go back to Hogwarts f another school year The new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher is a mysterious grouchy wizard called "Mad-Eye" Moody who seems to have a likeg  Harry sce he's always tryg to protect him  help him out On the first day back at Hogwarts Profess Dumblede makes an announcement that the Quiddch games will be canceled this year because of the Triwizard Tournament There are three competers called champions  the tournament  they all have to be at least seventeen years old to compete In this compilcated competion the champions have to use their skills  strengths  ws to defeat really dangerous tasksthe wner earns a huge trophy  1000 Galleons F some reason when  is time to choose the three champions from each of the three schools a fourth name--Harry Potter's--is picked from the Goblet of fire!

And Harry has another encounter wh Ld Voldemt--this time 's me deadly Plus Sirius Black ( you don't remember from "Prisoner of Azkaban" Black is Harry's godfather  his father's best friend) returns!

I LOVED this book I have read  about six times   still doesn't get bg I thk JK is gettg better  better The book is long-but  only took me two days to read  I'd rather the book be long though because I don't ever want  to fish!!! The plot is really good   is impossible to desert the book when you're up to the last 100 pages I missed cheerleadg practice because of those last 100 pages lol I would advise EVERYONE to read this book
JK Rowlg's fourth book is her most expansive  scope  a thoughly enjoyable read  While other commenters have noted some consistencies  deficiencies  is easy to gloss over these  Readers who allow themselves to be transpted to Ms Rowlg's Wizardg wld will barely notice the consistencies  enjoy the wld revealed by the auth's pen  Afterall  one were to get to npiky - would we even believe  wizards wches flyg brooms hippogrfs veelas  lepuracans?  Although I will agree wh a pri reviewer  that Ms Rowlg could easily have cut 100 pages  me -  should I say her ed should have done soIn her pri books JK Rowlg concentrated on troducg us to Harry Wizardg  Hogwarts (Book 1) expg upon the Hogwart's wld (Book 2)  delvg to Harry  his family even me (Book 3)  All of these focused on certa aspects of Harry's wld  establish the basis f the fourth book where the whole of the wizardg wld is laid open to us  True to serial book fashion Book 4 also sets up Book 5 - which will surely be terestg!
Just quickly I loved the first 3 Harry Potter books especially #3 I fd them well paced  fun  excg However I just fished #4  I must be honest I found this book subpar wh the others the sty meered  was a tad slow I thought that JKR was havg trouble comg up wh a sty  decided to spew fth an edion that could have been shtened by about 200 pages Now I love to read fluff books as much as the next guy however I was fdg this book too long f all tents  purposes I mean can you watch a 3 hour movie of the Power puff girls befe you say "jeez this is a tad long" Remember JK thk of the ltle kids who are readg this book I just hope she didn't get paid by the page? Well 's only a they
While I found "The Goblet of Fire" a very entertag read I was que disappoted by the huge plot flaw which revealed self at the end nullyg the motivation f the entire book  Whout givg away the plot there is no reason f the ptkey at the end of the novel to be the object  is  The whole plot hangs on this  The bad guy could much me easily made somethg else the pt key as soon as Harry gets back to Hogwarts  wh a lot less fussBecause there is need f the pt key to be the em  question the verisimilude of the novel crashes  burns  I was especially disappoted because up until this pot I thought plottg was Rowlg's greatest strength  She sure blew   book fourAlso Harry drops the Marauder's Map when his leg is  the stair  Fe He tries to reach   Fe But why doesn't he just say "Accio Map!" just like he did the Firebolt eh?  We know he knows that spell cold  And after all he uses that comm to great effect  the climax  Why not use  here? Couldn't thk of any other way f Mad Eye Moody to get the map JK?  Tsk tskwem
JK Rowlg has h another home run wh her fourth stalment of the Muggle confed wizard Harry Potter  "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" In this book our young hero is 14 years old  on his way back to Hogwarts School of Whcraft  Wizardry to the great company of his two best friends Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson  the movie)  Ron Weasly (Rupert Grt) But befe anythg that might be construed as bg  anythg that will cause learg  our heros they must first go the biggest sptg event  the wizardg wld: The Quiddch Wld Cup Dark thgs are gog down right at that time though which everybody except the villian Ld Voldemt  his fahfull servent Peter "Wmtail" Pettigrew are not knowg ofThis book as everythg that a loyal Potter fan  even somebody who hasn't read one can enjoy: adelescent angst at the schools Yule Ball a sleazy repter  magic up the wazzoo Makg a very welll plased return  this book as Harry's godfather is Sirius Black who made his debut  the third book "Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban"The tone  tempo of the series so far has gone flawlessly The first book is very occent  fancyfree the second one dwells deeper to the darker ptions of the characters lives the third one steps outside of Hogwts  the fourth one takes all three of the themes  crams them together Most people that I have talked to have said that  is too long but I thk that is what makes  great the thgs that happen can't be contaed  a 350 page book The end will make you feel like your watchg a reunion on a TV show  wag to see the rest of the cast jo the ma character Mentioned  the essential hospal scene is none other than fmer Dark Arts teacher Remus Lup  a name that you might recognize: Arabella FiggWhat makes the Harry Potter series much me entertag than the Ld of the Rgs trilogy is that Harry  his friends do me than wonder around  look f a magic rg  actually teract  participate  thgs that are fun but also be  periliss dangerAlthought this book is much darker (The Death Eaters)  still has a sense of goodness   that manests self perfectly  his godfathers extreme loyalty to Harry "Goblet" is the Wizard of Oz of our time  is not only a childrens fantasy novel but also a great detective sty  such a fast read that you will want to read  aga  aga  agariends do me than wonder around  look f a magic rg  actually teract  participate  thgs that are fun but also be  periliss dangerAlthought this book is much darker (The Death Eaters)  still has a sense of goodness   that manests self perfectly  his godfathers extreme loyalty to Harry "Goblet" is the Wizard of Oz of our time  is not only a childrens fantasy novel but also a great detective sty  such a fast read that you will want to read  aga  aga  aga
harry potter  the goblet of fire is the best book thus far  the series which as you know is sayg somethg!  i absolutely loved this book  have read all 734 pages of  three times ( countg!)  's probably not f ltle kids as  is que a b scarier than the first three but has me action suspense  evil!   you are a harry fan you'll love this book  even  you're not you'll still love !
I have read all 4 years of Harry's Hogwarts experience now  I have to adm that this was my least fave of the 4 books It's not that the book wasn't entertag - Ms Rowlg certaly wove an trigug tale  It's just that I thk she could have elimated at least 100 pages perhaps me She seemed to take a wdy Dickensian detour addg too much extraneous fmation  certa parts This should not discourage Hary Potter fans who have not yet read Book 4 - Year 4 is very imptant  young Harry's le  after muddlg through the extraneous you'll fd this a must read!In any case the rise of Ld Voldemt  the consequent discussion of good vs evil comes at a time when the events of September 11th have fced society to exame these issues as they perta to our own lives The dark note on which this book ended makes me nervously anticipate Harry's 5th year at HogwartsKeep wrg Ms Rowlg - the books are so much me imptant than the movies ( better too!)

This boy's name is Harry Potter He has been attendg school at Hogwarts f three years now  This year there will be some changes at Hogwarts although no one knows what they will beThe sty starts out at the old Riddle home  The gardener Frank hasn't been  the house f years but decides to go to   He hears people talkg  tries to escape but gets caught  killed  All of a sudden Harry wakes up  is breathg hard as  he had been runng  his scar hurt wse than ever befe  But soon after he was fe  Harry goes to Ron's home f a ption of the summer  goes to the Quiddach Wld Cup  As everyone is walkg back to the ses they are stayg at someone makes the dark mark  The mark of the Dark Ld Voldemt  After this awful happeng Mr Weasley takes everyone back to the house to get ready to go to HogwartsOnce at school they fd out about the Triwizard Tournament  There will also be two other schools comg to Hogwarts  The two schools will be Beauxbatons  Drumstrang  There will be one person from each school to take part  this tournament  But somethg unexpected happens  there will be me than just three participants  This tournament consists of three dangerous tasks but all of them will be supervisedThe new defense agast the dark arts teacher will be a retired mistry of magic wker Mad eye moody  Hagrid the character that everyone loves is put to a dficult suationWhen the third task comes one participant is hurt  one dies  But to fd out what happens to these people you have to read this book that is amazg  full of mysteries wh magical happengs
The Harry Potter Fever didn't h me until I saw the preview of the movie  TV  After that I decided to read the books  After fishg the first 3 books  a matter of weeks  was time to h the fourth  latest book  the series  Upon readg the first few pages of the book I was stantly brought back to the magical wld of Harry Potter  This time the book has a darker feel to   rightful so sce Voldemt is near his rebirth  Not givg away too much there is a rare tournament happeng  Hogwarths this year  3 Schools of magic are competg f pride  braggg rights  Will Harry be just another spectat  a compet?

This is another volume  an outstg deeply satisfyg series but I wonder  the auth may be startg to run out of steam  While volume four is very good the underlyg plot structure Rowlg must know needs to change  The fmula so far has been that Harry meets the challenge of dealg wh Ld Voldemt  along the way he engages wh some he trusted who turn out to betray him  there are other "surprises" now comg to be somewhat expected  Rowlg has excellent stcts as a wrer so I suspect that the delay of volume five is due to her desire  efft not to cash  on her success  a fmulaic way but to come up wh another book that will not only take Harry to a higher level of matury ethical sight wizardry skills  romance but also reflect her own growg matury as a novelist
This is an awesome book! This is the fourth book  the "Harry Potter" series It is probably one of the best I look book three a ltle b better but not by much You can't put this book down begng till end 's great You will defately love ! Harry Potter ROX!

This Harry Potter book was me adult  I loved   As a 22 year old Harry lover I am me proof that Harry spills over to all ages  The twists  turns were like none I was expectg  Just when you thk that Rowlg must have used up her imagation she spoils us aga wh her novation  The Tri-Wizard Tournament was so much fun  I feel like that I am learng the spells along wh Harry  that one day I will be able to DO them myself  I wish there really was a Hogwart's that one could attend even  I am a MuggleMad-Eye Moody was great  when Mad-Eye was not (really) around he was still  Character  That is when he was beg impostered  I suppose the poly-juice took on characteristics tooAnd Dobby was back!!!!  Wky too who ended up beg evil - termendously exploed by Rowlg's explosive wds  I love Dobby  the thgs that he comes out wh  I hope that Dobby will be a central character  the later booksI've read all four books  look fward to Harry startg his fth year me of Dobby  Sirius  I thk that him startg to take OWLS will also be an adventure  selfThe fth book was a delight  I loved   F all Harry lovers
I loved this book  I am 27 years old  I started readg Harry Potter when I went was dered to go on bedrest durg my pregnancy  They have really helped me get through  Rowlg's books seem to improve wh each new Harry Potter adventure  I can't wa f the next one

In Harry Potter's fourth  most darg adventure "The Goblet of Fire" JK Rowlg leads us  a suspensefull journey that leaves us guessg Harry Potter now a much me mature 14 year-old has his most deep  violent encounters confrontations wh his friends  his first crush This is by far my most fave year at Hogwarts so far I love the way Harry has the competions the ball  his crush on Cho Chang It seems at last that Harry might have some real-le "muggle" problems but of course he hles them  a way only a wizard could The novel starts wh all these events startg off light-hearted  leavg us wh excement f the adentures to come Ltle did we know that the characters would take a turn f the wst Harry undergoes dangerous tasks nightmares that leave his scar hurtg  an encounter wh his deadly nemesis This is by far the most deep  violent confrontation wh his arch-enemy Voldemt resultg  the death of a classmate  the unvailg of the Death Eaters It also uncovers the underground secrets of the Mistry of Magic  the true pasts of faculty members  high members of the Mistry I most enjoy Rowlg's use of feshadowg to tie all these events together  give us clues to what just might happen Feshadowng is the use of events  symbols  der to give us a preiew on what is next to come Rowlg uses this lerary device most diligantly F example when Wky Mr Crouche's house elf saves a seat f him at the Quiddch Wld Cup Crouch's failure to show up  the mystery of where he was  why he wasn't there feshadows Mr Crouch's dissapearence later on  Wky's role   Another example is Harry's dream about the snake This feshadows Voldemts use of the snake  his encounter wh Harry I most enjoy Rowlg's use feshadowg mostly because  gives a glimpse to the endg  the dangerous events to come I thk Rowlg's use of this lerary device strengthens the novels sty-le  is employed well Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I hope is not the best we'll see from JK Rowlg but is right up there  the top oh I don't know three I thougly enjoyed this book  I would defantly reccomend  anyone who loves a fairytale wh heart Also to anyone who is willg to stay up all hours of the night just becuse they couldn't put  downvice strengthens the novels sty-le  is employed well Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I hope is not the best we'll see from JK Rowlg but is right up there  the top oh I don't know three I thougly enjoyed this book  I would defantly reccomend  anyone who loves a fairytale wh heart Also to anyone who is willg to stay up all hours of the night just becuse they couldn't put  down
At nearly 800 pages "Goblet" is the longest Harry Potter book yet It's also the best - filled wh twists  turns that make  dficult to put down There are almost 4000 reviews f this book on Amazoncom so I won't dwell on plot pots In general everythg you love about the Potter series is here  large quanties: new spells characters villians twists etc It's a meldg of two of lerature's most successful genres: It's the "Hardy Boys meet Frodo Baggs" all mixed to one mega-franchise Meover the end of this book keeps you on the edge of your seat: It's kd of like the end of "Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back" where you don't want  to be over because so many thgs are unresolved What can I say: Buy  Read  Love  And then like the multudes befe you wa patiently f the next stallment
A review by ChrisThe sty Harry Potter  the goblet of fire is about a fth year student of Hogwarts School of wizards  wches Where Harry learns to protect him self  perfm several curses  he also plays several games like quidch  is  the triwizard gamesI liked this sty but I didn't like how Harry didn't know that anyone was after him But I liked the constant excement  how Sirius was always talkg to Harry And I enjoyed the ways Harry did his challenges but I liked that defense agast the dark teacher Im mad how they got rid of him at the endIt a good book f anybody that likes to read
This book was good but just not as good as the other ones  the series  There seemed to be too many unanswered questions the sty didnt have an end true  will contue  to the next book I am sure but the book s self seemed complete  It was an excellant book but after readg the other wks of Rowlg  doesnt cut 
JK is the best auth She knows how to hook u to the book wh fun  excg twists  Especially  this fourth book  I feel like i am  hogwarts right along side harry because her wrg is so vivid  I cant wa until her next book  see what new excg adventures there are :)
I thk this book was a very terestg book It has a lot of action If you like a lot of mystery  suspense you will like this book You will want to read this book over  over aga
I have the set of four J K Rowlg books about Harry Potter  The books are all "GREAT"  As far as the books beg bad f children!  Well I have seen what kids learn from music on the market  what is taught  school  My kids will be able to read Harry Potter  not have to be subjected to the filthly language used  music   school  The Harry Potter books are a very good change of pace readg
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book I have ever read wh my children It is packed wh adventure  everthg you'll ever want  a book Yet although we loved the other Harry Potter series we devoured this book I personally could not put the book down Every time you read the book you always fd somethg new you haven't noticed befe If you are lookg f a book to read  still  haven't read the Harry Potter books you MUST but you need to start wh the first book otherwise  will be to confusg to underst I also recommend any of the other JK Rowlgs books  anythg by Robert Stanek
Although I do love the Harry Potter series  thk  is a GREAT way to spark childrens' ( adults'!) imagation I have to adm that I feel greatly dissapoted by this particular book  The other books were great as well but I still feel that the first book is the best  the longer JK Rowlg makes her books the wse they get  the less imagative  me scary they get  I hope that the new book (I also am dissapoted  has taken so long  still there is no wd of a new book) is not as long  features the key simplicy of the first book
i enjoyed readg this sty  am happy that Rowlg made  longer the characters are enjoyable to follow  a longer sty just made  even better i am a fast reader  were  sht i would have fished  too quicklyi give  only four stars because  does feel like she has already used up her imagative stuff  the first three  now is begng to repeat her stuff  may be that she was rushed to fishg this book we'll see  a pattern holds up once we get the fth book out
In this new book we start off wh Harry havg a dream about a chillg tale volvg a murder  a small town wh lks to Voldemt himself but is  all just a dream?  After attendg the Quiddch Wld Cup wh his friends Harry returns to Hogwarts  learns that an terscholastic tournament that has been banned f centuries will be started up aga wh Hogwarts hostg  Each school will have a champion selected by the Goblet of Fire which will choose the most wthy student from each school  However somethg goes wrong   chooses four students stead of three the fourth beg Harry  Bound by magical code to stay  the tournament Harry is fced to take on challenges that are deemed to dficult f anyone under a sixth year  school  Thgs are gog well until the last event when somethg unexpected happens  Harry wnesses one of the most hrible thgs imangable  F the fourth time Rowlg provides us wh a great sty great laughs  an overall great time
Just purely  simply excellent a must-readLong praise to JK Rowlg Harry Potter  his students friends (except Malfoy of course)

Full of magical moments which we could all use a ltle me of however most imptantly this chapter  Harry's le is filled wh me challanges  the obvious struggle between good  evil once aga assures us the battle is wthwhile  It is such a pleasure to have Harry Potter  his wld told to us by a very talanted  sensive auth JK Rowlg  Thank You!!!!

Harry Potter  The Goblet of FireJK Rowlg who transfmed a TV generation to book lovers contues to create magic  her fourth novel Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Her series about a boy at odds wh himself his family  his entire wld until he discovers that he is a magical wizard speaks volumes on what  means to feel like an outsider  at long last fd love  acceptanceIn Rowlg's earlier novels Harry begs to underst his powers through a series of adventures that teach him to trust his friends question authy  most imptantly believe  himselfThis tale is as old as time but Rowlg stretches the mal play to a new elevation as evidenced by the book's dedication: "to Susan Sladden who helped Harry out of his cupboard"Granted Harry's adoptive parents fced him to sleep  an old cupboard but  is a rather simple step to take this meang less lerally  Nowadays "Comg out of the closet" means me than an announcement of one's sexualy -  refers to takg pride  those aspects of your character that others would have you deny eher out of discomft denial  the desire to not be dferent  Rowlg uses Harry's posion as an outsider  the Muggle (non-magic) wld to depict what  feels like  the real wld when you are made to feel dferent  follows Harry through a process of acceptg his dferences This is a valuable lesson f Muggles of any ageRowlg refuses to fce Harry to f to a mold  In The Goblet of Fire Harry  several other wches  wizards are fced to rescue the person they will "sely miss" F Harry this is Ron his best friend But even as magic has decided that Harry will miss Ron most Harry realizes that decidg whom to save  therefe have  his le is not that simpleThat Rowlg likes to toy wh conventions is evident  From her real-le rags to riches sty to a strikgly femist subplot that has characters questiong whether house-elves (who cook  clean) should be paid Rowlg refuses to let thgs slide simply because they are expectedThe same is true wh Harry  How easy  would have been to have Harry transion to the wld of magic  live there  bliss  But this would not be true  real  In Harry's adventures his greatest adversaries are from the magic wld from his own feelgs of self-doubt  from the people he is expected to trustRowlg has opened new dos throughout her Harry Potter series  this fourth stallment is no dferent  Rowlg may be "just a children's auth" but she has demonstrated once aga that the lessons we learn as children about acceptance tolerance  takg on new challenges shape who we are Harry's le is dficult especially after he learns who he is but what makes Harry's le so rich is his abily to transcend the evil fces  his wld  le live to the fullest  F children  adults this is somethg we struggle wh daily - to not give  to le's challenges Keep fightg the good fight Harryubplot that has characters questiong whether house-elves (who cook  clean) should be paid Rowlg refuses to let thgs slide simply because they are expectedThe same is true wh Harry  How easy  would have been to have Harry transion to the wld of magic  live there  bliss  But this would not be true  real  In Harry's adventures his greatest adversaries are from the magic wld from his own feelgs of self-doubt  from the people he is expected to trustRowlg has opened new dos throughout her Harry Potter series  this fourth stallment is no dferent  Rowlg may be "just a children's auth" but she has demonstrated once aga that the lessons we learn as children about acceptance tolerance  takg on new challenges shape who we are Harry's le is dficult especially after he learns who he is but what makes Harry's le so rich is his abily to transcend the evil fces  his wld  le live to the fullest  F children  adults this is somethg we struggle wh daily - to not give  to le's challenges Keep fightg the good fight Harry
Harry Potter Book 4 is goodbut I was a b dissapoted when I read The book is over 600 pages long there is no any kd of depth to the styJK Rowlg is good when she's up to the sty conceptbut when  comes to characters  emotionsHarry was one-dimensional character from the begggbut I didn't expect Sirius Black to turn  some goody boybecause I liked his dark image from the Book 3 very muchIn the endthe best character  whole series has to be Peter PettigrewHe's not pure goodn is he pure evilbut somethg of bothJK Rowlg should stop  thk  the next bookI expect a me complex sty  charactersIf notthen Harry Potter is very likely to turn  some dirty soap-opera wh no meangPS-Movie [STINKS]!!!!
I LOVED this book   was so much fun to readpart of the joy of this book was the suspenseyou never know whats  ste f harry
I have never been so immensly impressed by any readg  my particularly meangless le! I have read the first three Harry Potter books  less than a week I wasnt able to put them down(I had to pull myself away to do a termpaper!) It has been such an experience readg these books I loved the sties wh their surprisg twists  the characters are just to die f! It makes me feel like I am right there  Hogwarts stg  the Gryffd common room wh Ron  Hermione  on the Nimbus 2000/Firebolt wizzg around wng Quiddch matches! I suggest these books f people ages 10 to 100( beyond  you have the luck of owng a scers stone!) Now off to the library to take out the next book!
I just fished the 4th Harry Potter book  am a ltle sad 's over  I never thought I'd say that after readg a 700+ page book but 's true  I thought  was slow  the begng so  took me a while to really get to  I'm so glad I kept wh  because  was certaly wth the ltle extra efft  This book tricked me me so than any of the others  I thk there was a nice twist at the end that I never saw comg  a great lead  to the next book to come  Rowlgs hasn't disappoted me yet  I can't wa until the next one is released
I have to addm that some of the best books that i have read  le happens to be the Harry Potter booksThe biggest group of people that happen to be  love wh these books happen to people wh imagation  hope that everythg will happen just the way one hopes  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire shows goals  hope that no matter what anyone can to anythg despe age  gender Harry had to over come a large battle wh himself as well as all those around them Many childern  the wld have had hope to become Harry  his friends Beyond that these books have sired people young childern to read  movie companies to prof  The adventure  this book is about Harry gettg put to a very hrible suation  not knowg how to get out of  Wh the help of his friends he fds his way out Wh members of the "he who should not be named" group risg as well as himself risg lookg f revenge on Harry f somethg that is not Harry's fault The sty goes up  beyond anythg that only one nmal person thks I believe that JK Rowlg is me then a nmal person  These books are classics  go beyond any  a lot of books wrten f all ages
Hi I'm a big harry potter fan I LOVED !  now I've read all four I am just DYING f the 5th by the way Harry will be 17 by thetime he's fished school  I hope after that book's done (year's later I hope!) she'll release one about a wch
As soon as I fished readg Kg Ftis the Brave (Another excellent book that all fans of Harry Potter will love) I te to this book  It was fantastic  I was a ltle timidated by the size of the book at first (which was probably why I read Ftis first - at 172 pages  was a ltle me managable) but quickly became absbed    This may be a long book but  is so much fun that I hardly seemed to notice  I recommend  highly to any fan of fantasy fiction
I just fished this book  I fally feel caught up wh the rest of the wld!  I was a ltle late gettg on the Harry Potter bwagon but now that I'm there I'm totally caught up  the sty!  I can't wa f book 5 to come out!  The first four were all wonderful sties I'm a 33 year old sgle guy wh no children!  I generally don't even like fantasy-type novels!  I wrapped up book 4  then began to read "To Kill a Mockgbird"that is much me my "stard" type of book  But these Harry Potter books are wonderful -- f any age!  So whatever your age  whatever your taste I encourage you to give them a try!  (And be sure to start wh book 1  don't jump to the middle of the series!)
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire J K Rowlg wrote another good book  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the fourth  the Harry Potter series  In this one Harry fds himself  a wizards tournament  Hogwarts  two other wizard schools are havg a young wizards competion  It is only f wizards  their fourth year  later but somehow Harrys name gets entered wh the others  There are now two Hogwarts students  the competion but only one from the other schools  the competion  The competion is tough  he fds himself scared about the next event every time The usual characters are still  the book but me are added too  Ron Weasley  Hermoe Granger  of course Draco Malfoy  J K Rowlg shows me through these characters that all people are  ltle dferent Read this book to fd out why there are two kids from Hogwarts who are  the tournament  why Harry is afraid of all the events that are comg up soon
I'm not 13 I'm 45 And I just want to say I love the Harry Potter Books I'm from the south(that should say alot) And Our past was bashg the books bad So like every other person that is told not to do somethg I'm gog to do  I read the first bookI fell  love wh Harry Potter  his friends I didn't fd the demonic spells to drag all good kid to HELLI found a ltle boy  a unhappy homeSaved by a SchoolI also saw great lessons He sts up f hisselfAnd his friendsSo I hope RK Rowlg contues wrtg about Harry I'd love to see Harry grow up to become a great WizardLookg fward to the next Books[]

I thought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was the best book out of the whole seriesIt had a lot of pages which is good because I like to readThe plot was cool too  set the scene f the next booksThanks f listeng to my review
In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire has a mixture of excement  mystery Through out the book there is always a ltle excement  adventure  each chapter The reason why I read this book was my brother said that this book was really good So one day when I was board I started to read this book It was grabbg my attention when I first read the chapter I couldn't put the book downThe book was about Harry Potter  how he got his name to the goblet of fire The triwizards tournament was held at Hogwarts  Harry was chosen to be one of the four champions The triwizards tournament there is a series of three tasks  quests you have to do Durg the last task Harry  another champion from hogwarts meet at the end of the task  was gog to touch the triwizard trophy together Harry didn't want to take the trophy so he told the other champion to take  The other champion didn't want to because he thought Harry deserved  so they both touched  at the same time When they touched  they were telepted to Ld Voltemt!My fave part of the book was  the begng where they went to the Quiddch Wld Cup That was my fave part because I like all kds of spts Harry  his friends went to the actual stadium  watched the wld cup That was the most terestg part to me
This fourth book  the Harry Potter series contues to present Harry as a hero who gets by wh very ltle punishment  consequence f disobedience  lyg Other characters who are supposedly 'good' such as Mr Weasley the father of Harry's friend Ron also lie   fact Mr Weasley advises his two sons to not tell their mother that they gambled The sty starts wh a murder  a very gruesome  repulsive rual is perfmed towards the end of the book The book also presents the idea that the ends justy the means I read all four books  carefully documented many mal problems  the ma characters that cause these books to be highly appropriate f children ages 9-12 Addionally as a fmer astrologer I thk  is imptant f people to know of the book's endsement of the study  use of occult arts such as castg spells  divation Harry is not learng to be a wch he is learng to master fces that are the doma of a would-be scerer
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was an excg page-turner but at times became a ltle too verbose  would have probably been better  the eds had seen f to trim  down a ltle  Still  was probably the best book that I have read sce fishg the young adult fantasy adventure Kg Ftis the Brave by LaMontagne  Snyder
I don't care how old you are  you can read this should defely be on your readg list  All of the Harry Potter books are excellent!  I am currently readg  aloud to my 6 year old Niece!
Befe I open any new Harry Potter book I always pause to wonder  JK Rowlg can manage to make this book befe than the ones befe  And at the end of each book I can once aga say yes!In the fourth book of the Harry Potter series Harry starts his fth year at the Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  Befe gog to school Harry goes to his first professional Quiddch match wh his best friend Ron Weasley  his family but thgs go terribly wrong after the match leavg everyone to wonder  evil Ld Voldemt will rise aga  As  that's not enough excement f young Harry Potter he suddenly fds himself  the middle of the dangerous Tri-Wizards Tournament where  takes everythg a wizard know about magic to succeed stay alive  I could say me but that will ru the funAs usual this fourth stallment of the Harry Potter book is excellently wrten wh me  me tricately woven plots than  the previous books  The plot twists  turns are just as complicated as ever but Rowlg's clear narrative leads us through them cleanly  The book is also longer at 700+ pages  I suspect that some parents will object to some of the darker plot les  the book (maly centered around death  murder)  there were a few naughty wds here  there (specicially the wd "damn")  The endg was que a shock even f me an adult fan but I also felt that  was necessary f  to end that way  The Goblet of Fire is the first book  the series  which you get a real klg of how frighteng  evil Ld Voldemt really is  I suspect that thgs will only get darker f Harry  books to come  We're not dealg wh the half smart/half stupid evil character that shows up  many children's books  So be prepared!  As f appropriateness f children I f one don't really believe  hidg the facts of le from kids  I would have no problem wh them readg  although dependg on their age I might prefer to read  to them stead of havg them read  on their own  There are some thgs  the book that can be scary to young children  However I'm sure that not all parents will feel that way so I would advise parents who are sensive to subjects such as death  curse wds to read  first befe allowg their children to read eir age I might prefer to read  to them stead of havg them read  on their own  There are some thgs  the book that can be scary to young children  However I'm sure that not all parents will feel that way so I would advise parents who are sensive to subjects such as death  curse wds to read  first befe allowg their children to read 
This book is still focused maly on the three characters of Harry Ron  Hermione  IT is also still full of the antics of the Weasely tws  family  But this one adds me punch  the creepy/scary department  While I allowed my 11 year old to read  -(after I myself did of course) I will not allow my 6  9 year old to  This book is simply not meant f younger readersI found  thoughly entertag but  need of better edg  Some of the sty les simply do not blend well  this book is startg to show some amateur qualy  It is well wth the read because we all want to keep up wh the threesome!  This book does offer yet another hook  the end to get you to read the next  That is a gt that Rowlg seems to possess- chapter to chapter  all her books as well  Those "hooks" can sometimes aggravate me when I try to put  down  I fd that I cannot because Harry is up to somethg else excg  I simply have to fd out what  is next while dner was!
In this sty Harry goes to see the Quiddch Wld Cup wh his friend  Ron  his family At the Wld Cup a mysterious figure conjures the Dark Mark  a House Elf is accused of conjurg  Back at school The Triwizard Tournament is beg held  Harry was picked to be the fourth champion As Harry fights  the three tasks Sirius Harry's godfather warns him that one of the feign teachers that arrived f the tournament was a Death Eater (a person who wked f the wizard Voldemt) At the last task Harry  Cedric touched the cup  they were sucked to where Voldemt was Voldemt then took some of Harry's blood  returned to power When Harry returned he found out that the reason he Harry was picked f the tournament was all Voldemt's plan one of Voldemt's servants had put his name  the Goblet of Fire  the begng I chose to read this book because I had read all of the other three books  the Harry Potter series When the book first came out I saw on the news that there were already people  le to buy the book the day befe After that I couldn't buy the book f another few weeks  My fave part was when Harry had to fight the dragon Hungarian Hntail When he was called to fight the dragon he pictured that he was  a Quiddch match Harry thought that the dragon was a bludger  that the golden egg was a golden snch And then Harry tricked the dragon to fly away from the eggs  then Harry swooped down  caught the golden egg
Harry Potter Book ReviewHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire by JK Rowlg is book four  the four book series I recently read this sty  I thought that  was an credible sty wh many twists  turns Harry is gettg himself to many me predicaments wh his enemy Ld Voldermont While contug to attend Hogwarts School of Wizardry  Wchcraft Harry is learng a great deal me about charms potions  defense agast the dark artsIn this sty Harry is chosen by the goblet of fire to participate  the tri wizard tournament where this time there are four students Harry was anonymously entered  the tournament by someone other that himself nevertheless Harry contues to participate  the tournament because he is bound by his name Harry knows that he didn't enter himself  the tournament  He knows that someone has   f him so he has to be sure to watch his backWhile participatg  the tournament a lot happens Reeta Skeeter the news repter is causg a lot of trouble around Hogwarts She is prtg false sties about a lot of people that wk there  gettg them to trouble Harry is also havg problems wh his scar  is hurtg because Ld Voldermont's evil is beg transmted to Harry via nightmaresOver all this sty was a great h  I recommend  f people of all ages Whether you read  f comedy  not the sty may appeal to you I really thk that you should give Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire a chance  read 
No Ld Voldemt (aka You-Know-Who) doesn't say this to Harry  the book but still this book has a very Empire-Stikes-Back like feel to   The book chronicles the adventures of Harry Potter  his friends durg his fourth year at Hogwarts School f Wizardry  Wchcraft  Everythg has been gog pretty well f Harry durg his first three years at Hogwarts wh new friends learng Quiddch wizard trag  defeatg Ld Voldemt's plans  Turns out though that Ld Voldemt has just been gettg ready to make his big move which comes durg this bookIt's gettg me  me obvious that JK Rowlg must to some extent  another have planned out the entire series befe she ever published the first book  Each book is a self-contaed adventure but they all build on each other slowly creatg a complex battle between the fces of good  evil  the wizardg wld  The first three books are  a sense "Act One"  That is they concern theselves wh troducg us to Harry  his wld they start establishg the relationships between the various characters they terject a BIG dose of mystery to the series  they make us very aware of just WHY the wizardg wld is so terried of Ld Voldemt even 13 years after his supposed demise  Then this book the fourth  the series is "Act Two"  which Voldemt makes his big move  begs the process of his return to power  Now at the end of book four the les are drawn  the characters  conflicts are established  Presumably the last three books  the series will concern themselves wh the battle between Harry Dumblede  the rest of the fces of good to stop Voldemt  his mionsThe books are also gettg me  me mature  their content  There is some stuff  this one which could easily give ltle kids nightmares  There are a number of fairly scary bs through the book cludg the cold-blooded murders of two charactersI'm not gog to go too much to details of the plot sce I don't want to ru  f you plus thgs have been covered fairly well by other reviewers but let me just say that f a long time I had no terest  readg these books  had dismissed them as nothg me than mdless kiddie books  However when the movie came out I picked up the first book out of curiosy  Now havg eagerly devoured all four books all this 32-year old engeer can say is WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT???actersI'm not gog to go too much to details of the plot sce I don't want to ru  f you plus thgs have been covered fairly well by other reviewers but let me just say that f a long time I had no terest  readg these books  had dismissed them as nothg me than mdless kiddie books  However when the movie came out I picked up the first book out of curiosy  Now havg eagerly devoured all four books all this 32-year old engeer can say is WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT???
I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series f about 2 years now  This book was considerably bigger than all the rest And when I had begun to read   was also considerably better than all of the rest There was me suspense a better plot but however there was no quiddch In der to make up f such a popular thg JK Rowlg had to do somethg equally as terestg  not me terestg But then aga how could you totally elimate quiddch from a Harry Potter book? Harry Potter is quiddch However Rowlg I am sure knew that she couldn't elimate quiddch  was able to cpate   this massive 1000 page h I would like to go on about how much I love Harry Potter  the endless reasons that you should read   tell you all of the best parts of the book but I am not gog to be the one to spoil  f you
I thk this one was the best so far
After readg Book 4 you'll very quickly want to read Book 5  This book is awesomethough much much darker then what you have seen so far  the series  I'm gog to warn you that the "they lived happily ever after" does not enter the picture here  This by far is a much me sister bookThat said there are many lighthearted moments as well  Especially  the begng when the Weasleys meet Harry's folks  That made me laughThough serious undertones slowly entrench themselves deeper  deeper as Harry Potter enters a tri wizard cup tournament  From there the book goes through a series of puzzles  challenges as Harry participates  the tournamentFally  the end you know the plot  That's the predictable part  What isn't is the result of the plot  In the first three books the consequences to Potter himself never seemed negative  Here though some real consequences start to fm as the outle f the last three books comes clearYou meet a lot me new  terestg characters  even see some old ones return such as sirius black  And f you snape hatersyou may learn to respect the man when you see what he has to doall  all I'd say this was the most adult of all the potter books  Now I can't wa to see where she goes  book 5
I am a 50 year old woman who picked this up  a friends powder room as a distraction Now I've dered the entire set  can not wa to see all the movies I was as a kid a fan of such series as the "Bras Benton Mysteries (Nancy Drews geeky male counterpart)  then later Thomas Covenant  Hchhikers Guide But Harry blows them all away!  This is a series f all ages as long as you have imagation  are young at heart If you thk you are not Harry will remd you What a wonderful way to wd down from a day filled wh too much realyBravo to Rowlg
I am a big fan of all Harry Potter books but this is defately the best yet At first I thought  was nothg much as I did wh the first second  third book but after readg  a couple of time 's just FANTASTIC! I am que a big book fan  I read a lot of books befe I read this one but just the wd Harry Potter changes the meang of lerature completly Many books have a simular style but no auth has come close to the way Jk Rowlg wres her books The way she does  is AMAZING! I reccomend this book to absolutly EVERYONE EVER! I loved  But don't just read the fth read them all! The only b I didn't like was Ra Skeeter Her repts on Harry etc annoyed me but JK Rowlg said she was put  there to demonstrate a pot - that beg famous can have 's downsides  she was there to give Harry the pa of fame so I thk Ra Skeeter was mabye necessary But everythg else about the book was fantastic! Especially the character buildg
I ran this book  one day  When I came to the end I cried f a while  I don't thk this book is good f children because  is very open ended  evil ws a battleI suggest people wa f the book 5 to come out  you will pull your hair out wh wry
I really liked this book because the auth created a complete wld of her own!! The books enrich the kids' imagation!! It has amazg wdg too you can acctually image  all I was fascated by the auths' creativy I mean to create a complete wld of your own isn't easy!! And JK Rowlg did very well wh that!! The whole sty isn't predictable  eher I personally hate predictable books because there isn't anythg exg jumpg out at you! So  you haven't readthis book yetthan Isuggest you should!!
Ok I'm a diehard Harry Potter fan But I loved this book I was so glad  was thicker because  meant me time wh Harry  the gang Each challenge that Harry faced was terestg  excg And they showed how Harry had grown  matured over the past 4 years Harry is loyal devoted  always tries to do the right thg He doesn't always thk befe he leaps but then gettg out of the subsequent predicaments is part of the sty It will be fun to see how Harry contues to grow  mature This book had a me serious tone than the previous books  I don't thk the latter part is suable f children under 9 unless they are mature f their age It really gets pretty scary there f a while I thk parents should read this one first  then decide whether to let their kids read 
After millions of copies sold thouss of children hooked  hundreds of families addicted  is blatantly appropriate to say that the fluence of JKRowlg's books remas contagious  fectious From first hearsay of Rowlg's unconquerable quartet of lerature the presence of great lerary devices was detectable To the reader the most obvious example would be her use of dynamic characterssuational irony  a somehwhat satirical theme  Harry Potter a "cderella" to certa extent embodies a change of po livg  few friends to a magical wizard lestyle filled wh fun  dreams only f f fiction I thoughly enjoyed all the books but my free readg choice was Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I really enjoyed this book among the others because of the suational irony employed by Rowlg A prejudice tone felt as muggles were placed agast wixards gives a good idea as to the auths feelgs of prejudice  racism As  many other fms of lerature dference is ptrayed as not always better but only to prove that  is ignance that sts between the two  Overall I enjoyed the 3rd Harry Potter novel the most but as f the Goblet of Fire a defe recommendation would be  der Though dynamic characters  suational irony give the audience as well as thouss of children's imagations a mystical captivation Rowlg's use of a somewhat satirical theme pushes this book from good to great An sight to the wld that dferences should be accepted but also embraced mirrs the nocent want to succeed  help others succeed  le This novel was above  beyond what was expected  imaged Now the only question is when the 5th will be out!
I am the mom of a big Harry Potter fan but I will adm to readg these books myself  They are wonderful!  Once you start you just can't put them down  JK Rowlg makes the most unbelievable magical thgs seem real  You can't wa to see what will happen to Harry next  The best part is that my daughter  I can discuss the sties together  You will not regret buyg this book -  is the most excg of them all so far!
Harry Potter is a great book about the trials of young soon to be scer I recomend this book to all no matter the age
Origally I was a b disappoted that there would be no Quiddch f Harry  It turned out to be f the best  I really enjoyed the wizardg tournament  It lent a certa dference to this book  This book is a must have f any Harry Potter fan  It's very obviously buildg to imptant events to come  Can't wa f the next book
By far the thickest of the four as of Jan 2002 I carefully predictthat the thickness shall not crease as the series progressesContrary to the complats of most crics about the size of the bookI subm that Rowlg is now wrg to her dedicated readers  isnot tryg to draw  new fans wh this wk  We dem thisprogressionAll thgs aside this is the deepest richest  broadest book  theseries  We are once me troduced to new styles  dimensionsa hallmark of the previous books  As I mentioned  my previousreviews styles that were developed  the first three books passthrough this volume  on towards the futureThe return of the Dark Ld is an almost welcome event at thisjuncture partially because a confrontation was evable  also dueto the fact that the fate of Harry is ultimately tied up wh hisnemesis  Their symbiotic relationship can only result  one outcomean endless struggle f power  domance over each otherNew dimensions of the wizard wld contue to unfold wh brilliantelements like Ptkeys (f stant teleptation) the Quiddch WldCup (a natural evolution of the fave wizardg spt)  theTriWizard Tournament (a fantastic new competion)  The troductionof other wizardg schools broadens the scope of Rowlg's wld byseveral magnudes  so she contues to amaze us as she peels awaycurtas revealg me of her imagationThe most imptant element troduced  the series thus far  myhumble opion is the wizard disciple of Aur  In the past I foundmyself grumblg at the ravages  madness of the Dark Wizards  Everymisdeed  crime they commted made me wonder  there was noganized resistance to the evilWhen the Aur Mad-Eye Moody appears f the first time I almostcheered  He represents a breed of wizard that dedicate their entirelives to the pursu capture  even destruction of Dark Wizards  Ifeel that whout such sacrice  focus evil would certaly havethe upper h over goodIt was certaly hearteng to me when Moody recommends this lonely agonizg path to Harry  I believe this is the most likely path four champion given the struggles he has endured wh Dark Magic scehis birth  I don't wish him pa  sufferg but the stuff his soulis made of suggests he would not fd peace unless he tried the hardesthe could to right wrongs  the wld around himAs always our heroes contue to grow  mature  We are certalyseeg the blossomg of romances  other higher aspirationsBrought many smiles to my faceThe staggerg conclusion  the gravy of the events to follow book five make me wonder how will our heroes survive this?

I've always loved to read books I'm an 18 year old male  when I first picked up Harry Potter I was a b sceptical about  but after the first 50 pages of Harry Potter 1 I was a regular Harry Potter fan I read all the Harry Potter books back-to-back  I even got my girlfriend hooked up on them  she hadn't touched a book  years This book is wonderfully wrten  contas a great sty wrten  a way that can be funny scary excg as well as depressg JK Rowlg underst like few other wrers how to deal wh a childs md  does this  such a way that even grown ups will love this book
This is JK Rowlg's fourth Harry Potter book Filled wh ideas she wres Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire In this book she troduces new characters new magical creatures  the latest of Ld Voldemt In this particular book there is me adventure ( a lot of pages)  what we saw fm the mute Harry got his w a type of relation wh You-know-who The plot is me complicated  once meJK ends  wh an excg  unexpected endg A fun way to spend our days enrichng our md wh magical knowledge there is Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire A book you must not loose the chance to read
Great! So terestg Just as good as any of the Harry Potter books I thk this book was Number1
"Goblet of Fire" is an credible achievement:  is clear  straightfward enough f younger children to follow  complex  grippg enough to hook even the most jaded adults Most impressive are the characters especially Severus Snape It would have been so easy f Rowlg to make him the posterboard-villa of the series yet the depth of his psyche is astoundg This is especially made clear  this bookMost tantalizg are the ltle clues thrown  every so often dedicated readers constantly read through the book to fd them If you look carefully you can predict wh some detail the answers to The Great Questions: Why does Voldemt want to kill Harry? What will happen next? Where will the battle les be drawn?Any reader should immediately buy all four books of the series  you haven't done so already The first two are "fun"  Rowlg clearly is takg much from "pop fantasy" but  the third book she really comes to her own I cannot wa f the fth book  I wish  would come out already!!
I started readg this series despe my better judgement due to the pesterg of my friends I did however fd that  captured my imagation que quickly although  was unmistakably a childrens sty As the series has progressed  seems to have become a lot darker  me sister wh the dements  azkaban  the re-emergence of Voldemt  the Goblet of fire Far from detractg from the books I fd that  adds to them  gives them far me credibily to adults I thouroughly enjoyed this book  would recomend  to anyone not a cynical so  so
J K Rowlg has rewarded her adult readers by takg a step up  the fourth stalment of the Harry Potter septilogyThe first three books were fun fast  full of action The fourth one loyally retas these features f s younger readers but adds a whole new dimension of trigug themes A multude of sub-plots boil away each commentg on analogous suations  the real wld Nonetheless the plotles all wrap up at the end very satisfactily ("like a jigsaw puzzle") while leavg the mouth wet  anticipation of the fth bookThe majy of the book is fairly light-hearted but the openg chapter gives a ht of the dark overbearg fale that will leave Hogwarts  deed all of Europe a much less safe place by the time the fth book arrives on shelves
This fourth book  the Harry Potter series blows the first three books away!  Harry fally comes face to face wh his enemy  is fced to use everythg he has learned to survive  This book is slightly "darker"  me frighteng than the other three but even me engagg  Though this book is over 700 pages I found myself wishg  were even longer  Incredible!
Another great adventure from Ms Rowlg  This time we fd Harry livg f the summer wh the Dursleys on Privet Drive two weeks befe gog back to Hogwarts  He has been starvg all summer because his enmous cous Dudley is on a strict diet  Harry's aunt believes they all should have to eat what Dudley has to eat  Harry lives on stale birthday cake he has hidden under the floboards  his bedroomHe wakes from a terrible nightmare one night his scar burng  a hrible feelg of dread  His fears are soon pushed aside though as he travels wh the Weasleys to the Quiddch Wld Cup  All kds of adventures ensue until Harry Ron  Hermione return to HogwartsUpon arrivg at school the students discover that the usual Quiddch cup will not be contested this year as an old tournament The Triwizard Tournament has been revived  Only wches  wizards 17 years of age  older can compete  Students from competg schools will compete wh the one student selected from HogwartsWhat happens when Harry's name is selected as one of the champions to compete begs a rollercoaster ride of an adventure!  Who entered him  the tournament?  Why does his scar contue to burn?  Another great mystery  another suprisg endg
I'm wh all the others I give this book five stars It is imagative crisply descriptive  full of excement I recommend  as one of the best fiction sties I have read I also recommend "West Pot" by Nman Thomas Remick the only book I have ever read that is a true (nonfiction) sty presented as a fantasy It's kd of a Harry Potter f grownups Try  You'll like   learn!
All the books are awesome I hadn't read anythg f months then I read the first book I was hooked I read all four  a month Stayed up all night to fish the fourth one Now I am on the wag list f the fth book The books seem like their childish but their f anyone 5 years old to 100 years old JK does an outstg job of creatg a whole other wld
First of all I have to take issue wh the so-called "serious" auths who would negate Ms Rowlgs contributions by fcg her removal from the New Yk Times Bestsellers list  relocatg her to a Children's Bestseller list  Sour Grapes all of you! A best seller is just that A book that sells the most copies regardless of s tended readership Put Ms Rowlg back on the top of the "real" list where she belongs!These books belong to all ages  Every member of my family has read them browed them from others  then purchased their own copies attended the 4th book's midnight unveilg parties  eagerly awa the next stallment!  My 74 year-old mother  law was recently widowed  received the boxed set of Potter books to distract her from her own grief  She is now a Potter-maniac  her own right  snatches up every Potter tie- product she fds! (mouse pad coffee mug etc!)It's a rare auth deed who can give children parents  grparents a magical wld they can't wa to share wh each otherI highly recommend Jim Dale's audio versions  They are richly characterized whout ommtg a sgle wd (trust me my 12-year old has listened repeatedly wh the books open tryg to catch any mistakes  so far has found only one where Dale refers to "Snape" as "Snipe") My husb is a truck driver who loves makg the miles fly by while gettg immersed  le at Hogwarts  he's gotten other drivers hooked on the series as well!I could go on  on toutg the virtues of these books (the foster child who takes a great deal of comft from the abused  neglected boy who discovers his own magic) but  you've read them you already know   you haven't what's stoppg you?
In the fourth  so far longest stallment  the Harry Potter saga we jo Harry Hermione  Ron as they attend the Wld Cup of Quiddch  start their 4th year of wizard trag at HogwartsThrust to the competion of the Triwizard Tournament through the machations of an unknown foe Harry must face not only the challenges of the contest self but also the temptation to give up to give  to offers to help him cheat  to his own renewed celebry  Harry comes up agast tougher puzzles scarier foes  a tragedy that hs close to homeJK Rowlg has done  aga as she tells the next tale of Harry Potter  doesn't shy away from tough suations  tough decisions f her characters who don't always make the right decisions but do try their best  I've read this book twice  each time  makes me cry a ltle  laugh out loud  I highly recommend each of the Harry Potter sties
I can only hope everyone who has gotten a change to read Harry Potter series can image the wld JK Rowlg creates as beg f real  would be amazg I put myself to the sty so much I can feel everythg like I am there  I am so captured by the characters  all that is gog on that I am hangg on every wd It is such a wonderful escape from the wld today I am on the wa list f book 5
These books are great even exceptionalhowever I have one pot to make they get darker Although some of the fans are older Harry Potter books are targeted to kids  the auth has remarked that they will get darker as the series progessesWhout givg away too much this book a student dies  the bad guys go unpunished to say the least This does take away from any pleasure derived from readg Harry Potter Wh these books is best to clear your calendar f the next day  so because you won't be able to drop the book until you are done  as the longest book  the series give  at least a day
I am a huge fan of all the Harry Potter books  I have read them all several times To me this is the best one of them allI really did not thk that The Prisoner of Azkaban could be bettered until I read this  Many people said that this book was too long but personally I feel the me Potter the better I was so wrapped up  the bookthat I stayed up until 2 readg   If you are a Harry Potter fan then this is defately a book f you Whether you are readg   havg  read to you  is very enthrallg  It is the kd of book that you want to fd out the endg very desperately but you also want to savour the suspense f as long as possible  This book made me laugh  cry  I would even advise adults to read -noone is to old to expeariance the magic!
I have completed the Harry Potter books & am defely lookg fward to the next one!  I had gotten terested  the books when the religious ganizations were agast Harry Potter  I thought "what could be so terrible so evil about Harry Potter?"  I did not fd one thg!  But I did fall  love wh the characters  the beautul imagation of JK Rowlg  There is no way  my opion that a child could fd evil side the pages of Harry Potter  I am a true believer  God  But a child will fd an excg new adventure  the desire to read which is a wonderful thg!  I also want to thank JK Rowlg f brgg the child out  me!
In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the kid wizard is back f me adventures  of course another battle wh you-know-who  I won't go to any me details here but I will say that the endg is very surprisg  completly dferent from what you are expectg  There's clearly a reason why Rowlg calls this book the pivotal book  the series I can't wa f the fth one
I have been read all four Harry Potter books by my mother We have the books  the audio tapes I prefer the tapes because I can listen to them any time I listen to them when I'm dog Lego  gog to bed Then I stop  when I'm tired I thk Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is the best book My sister likes Harry Potter too (she's just copyg me) These books are a dream come true to me My friend also likes the books Amazon has great books  tapes
This book is by far the best of all four books  While retag the playful childish aura of the first 3 books "The Goblet of Fire" takes on a completely new adult tone as well  This may make parents nervous about lettg the children read  but thk about   Death greed hate etc are true emotions that do occur  real le  Hidg your children from them will only make them ignant of them  won't help them  any wayThe plot is absolutely amazg  It twists  turns  throws thgs out of nowhere  You never know what is gog to happen next  the end is truly unpredictableThis is completely spired  awesome   will be hard to live up to!
The sty takes a dramatic turn  this book  It's both excg livg up to the previous books  poignant  She's leadg up to somethg huge  the next few booksHighly recommended f Potter fans!
What's good about the Harry Potter series is that the books are suable f both kids  adults This 4th book  the series is no exception It contas a mixture of elements which make would make  of terest to me mature readers while the me fantastic elements retaed a st of nocence  charm which will appeal to children Wonderful!
I liked this book the best out of all the four books because  is funny suspenfull  has so many twists  turns  leaves you wantg me  Even though this book is que long  makes up f  because  has so much detail  When I fished the book I couldn't  still can't wa f the next one to come out  I would deffatly recomend this book to people of all ages
Oh my god I couldn't put this book down when I started readg !  That is the honest truth right there  My mother is 51 years old  she thks Harry Potter is the best thg sence peanut butter  At first when I saw her readg a sty about a 12 year old boy I was like "Mom you're 51 years old why are you readg about a stupid 12 year old?" (yes I called Harry Potter stupid!  Ahhh!  I was fced to eat my wds though let me tell ya!)  she was like "Sarah you have no idea these books are amazg"  So  my seni year  highschool I fally started readg the first book right befe the movie came out  sce then I have been a dedicated Harry Potter fan  My friends have dubbed me Hermione that's how crazy I am about these books  Goblet was a long sty but I was sry when I fally fished  I wanted to read so much me than what I had  JK Rowlg really hs the spot when  comes to kids because wh Harry Potter the only thg dferent about his le is that he goes to school to learn about magic  we go to school to learn about stuff that will not help us  our le time!  But Harry still has to do homewk  he still has the problems that young teenagers face like crushes  teachers that don't like him  of course gettg to trouble  gettg detentions  If you haven't gotten this book yet GO OUT AND GET IT NOW!  GO!  JUMP OUT OF THAT COMPUTER CHAIR GO TO THE NEAREST BOOKSTORE AND GET THIS BOOK!  AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE OTHERS GET THOSE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!  I ORDER YOU!!!!!!
i have read each of the books  the "Harry Potter" series several times  have enjoyed none so much as the fourth i thk  is near impossible to fd a wd which describes this book crectly -  is far beyond splendid  magnicent i would recomend  to absolutely anybody any age even  they did not enjoy readg very much i read nothg else i have heard of people sayg the books are a bad fluence to children but honestly what's the wst  can do? i believe none of them have actually read the books like they say "you can't judge a book by 's cover" do not be put off be people who are agast Harry Potter - they are not wth missg out on the wonderful sties JK Rowlg has to offer
I am an adult who just had to know what all the hype was really about!  So I have now read the series 1 thru 4  By far the best of the series is Harry potter  the Goblet of Fire!  This book is fantastic!  It catches your attention from the start  leaves you hungry f me page after page!  Long after I fished  I was speculatg on what would happen next  Harry's fight agast the dark Ld Voldemt!  It is a classic battle between good  evil wh alot of fantasy thrown ! I would recommend  to kids of ALL ages!
I just fished readg this  I'm glad because I'm not at all comftable hg  over to my 9-year-old to read  The graveyard scene at the end is VERY violent not to mention some totally unnecessary profany scattered through the book (which I noticed also  the third book by the way) And I'm not too happy about the "cheatg is the secret to success" attude about the tournament eherAnd to the reader who said "It's not good f kids to read but who cares"--I care  It's beg marketed as a kids' book! At a mimum shouldn't the books we give our kids not conta wds the kids aren't allowed to use?My son  I both love the first three books Maybe the change  tone is evable as the characters get older  If that is the case 's a shame
As I was readg this book I imaged every sgle part as  I were side the plot  The characters are marvellously well described  also are the settgs  Mrs Rowlg has once me surprised me as she has already done wh all her other 3 booksThis one  particular although  is very long makes you turn pages quickly thrillg you every momentIf you read  you won't compla at all! I have read  twice ( english   spanish)  both times I was thrilledRead   you won't regret!
I have read many of the reviews f this book I saw one havg problems wh  Ian underst why you might not like  because you don't like fantasy books  long books But you shouldn't really discourage other people to try this book f themselves Many others tell the most suprisg parts of the book spoilg  People should try not to spoil  discourange other books so they could fd out by themselves I f one gave this book 5 stars because I fd  very suspensful  excg Many twists  turns make  a good book to read It is a pretty long but  makes up wh lots of detail
I am a 21 year-old  I have read this book  the others  the series three times each  My mother  twelve-year-old brother had been tryg to convce me to read them f ages when I fally gave  this summer  I am so glad that I did! As f this particular book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire defely ties wh the Prisoner of Azkaban f the best  the series  The Goblet of Fire is chock full of hum but is suspenseful  chillg as well  The endg is a great surprise   we are left cravg the release of book 5!  This series should be read by all ages!  Don't miss out!
Ahh yes another wonderful Harry Potter book by JK Rowlg defely one of the best Harry Potter books! Well then aga aren't they all one of the best?!  It's que hard to pick one of the best but Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is EXCELLENT  I recommend  f anybody ANY AGE!
At the end of this marvelous book Hagrid the Gamekeeper says somethg to the effect of &quotWhatever happens from this pot on we'll deal wh  as  comes&quotIt's simple wisdom but  the post-911 wld this book becomes me relevant than ever Yes this is the darkest of the four books  the longest Don't let that stop you from enjoyg every magical wd on the pages of this classic The battle between Harry  Voldemt between good  evil between the fces of darkness  the fces of light is epic  scope  there are lessons to be learned here Yes 's fantasy but don't thk f a moment that there aren't parallels wh our present-day real wldI'm constantly struck by how Rowlg has been able to keep up such a high level of wonder wh each book Here she outdoes herself Thank you Ms Rowlg f this marvelous series
I really enjoyed Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I found the characters to be me fleshed out as they were wh the first book (but seemed to lose somewhat  books 2  3)  I also very much enjoyed the troduction of characters from other parts of the wizardg wld  It gave the whole sty a much me round realistic feel to  ie:there is me to the wizardg wld than just Hogwart's AcademyThere are places where I felt that the events transpire  a somewhat th fashion  F example: there is truth serum then why does anyone have to wry about trust why can't we just admister  to those who claim to no longer suppt the Dark Ld  get on wh  - I also felt that Harry's &quotw&quot agast Voldemt this time to be a lte too convenient  Yet I have to remd myself  the other reviewers that this book is f children  It is not designed to have the complexy of adult fiction  Which brgs me to another issueThe next paragraph  not a complat simply a parental advisy:Some have claimed that this book is mally subversive  I would not go so far as to say that  However I do personally feel that the age recommendation given 9-12 years old is too low  If I were to rate this book as a movie I would mimally give  a PG-13 ratg perhaps even a &quotsoft&quot R  After all  does clude murder  the mixg of a potion by takg bones from a grave cuttg off someone's h  takg blood from a young boy's arm  I would not allow my own child under the age of 13 to read this book  I am an admted conservative (I won't allow my toddler to watch any of the modern Disney movies) so each must judge f themselves  I strongly recommend that all parents read this book befe allowg thier child to read  so that they may judge the dividual child's readess  discuss the themes  the book wh the child  I do not feel this is &quotmally subversive&quot material as another review has suggested  But a child should be able to underst ideas like cheatg isn't ok just because everyone else is dog  befe they read the book lest they hold up Harry Potter  what he does as a hero  role modelEnd of parental advisyOne other issue that I had wh this book the same issue that I had wh book 2  3 is that the auth constantly regurgates fmation from the previous books  the series  I fd this offensive  any series novel  Readers should take the time to read a series  der so that they underst what is happeng whout &quotclf notes&quot scattered through the book  Auths should not per to those who are too lazy to read the first books  At the very least  disrupts the sty f the reader who has read the previous books because you feel like you are stopped at a red light wag f the sty to go on after the auth has fised catchg the other readers (who did not read the first books) up wh the backgrounds another review has suggested  But a child should be able to underst ideas like cheatg isn't ok just because everyone else is dog  befe they read the book lest they hold up Harry Potter  what he does as a hero  role modelEnd of parental advisyOne other issue that I had wh this book the same issue that I had wh book 2  3 is that the auth constantly regurgates fmation from the previous books  the series  I fd this offensive  any series novel  Readers should take the time to read a series  der so that they underst what is happeng whout &quotclf notes&quot scattered through the book  Auths should not per to those who are too lazy to read the first books  At the very least  disrupts the sty f the reader who has read the previous books because you feel like you are stopped at a red light wag f the sty to go on after the auth has fised catchg the other readers (who did not read the first books) up wh the background
I am givg this book four stars stead of five becasue  took a long time to get to  Once I got past the quiddch match though I couldn't put  down I don't know the quiddch match at the begng just didn't keep my attention I took me a week to get through the first chapters  then once Harry went back to Hgwarts I couldn't put the book down  fished   a day All  all s the most complicated book  the series s very terestg  a great read If you haven't read  your  f a long journey  a big treat I can't wa f the fth!
I have read all of the Harry Potter books  the Goblet of Fire has been my fave by far In this book Harry  his friends beg to come of age  prove themselves as talented wizards Harry's successful completion of all the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament helps him live up to his great name  some beg to feel a new respect f him The return of Ld Voldemt shatters the perfect happy endg clich&eacute that many books of today hge on Harry  Ron also beg to have a new terest other than magic - girls! It is very clear who Harry has a crush on but I can't help wonderg  there is somethg gog on between Ron  Hermione?Some people say that the Harry Potter books are a negative fluence on kids some even say they promote wchcraft This could not be further from the truth The books all give a wonderful view of a magical mesmerizg wld that is just pla fun to read about I would recommend these books to anyone My 8-year-old cous loves them my mom loves them  I - a seni  high school - love them The wrg of JK Rowlg is so vivid  clear that I can actually image myself stg  Potions behd Harry  zoomg around on a broomstick next to him Readg these books has allowed me to feel as though I am  an credible magical wld that up until now I have only imaged
The ig of Harry Potter is a fascatg sty apart from the fiction self  In rags-to-riches tradion JK Rowlg a strugglg sgle-parent scrawled `Scerer's Stone' on scraps of paper while takg care of her child  wkg the slave-grd part time  Lo  behold `Scerer's Stone' is picked up by a publisher  goes on to sell me than 100 million copies wldwide  Harry Potter that messy-haired boy wh the cheap eyeglasses becomes ubiquous  the pop-culture climate championed by most as an excellent way to terest children  readg while scned  reviled by a small (but very loud) my of religious extremists the same st that gave us the Inquision  the Salem Wch-Trials  Well those few might learn somethg  they ever deemed to pick up a copy  broaden their perspective: `evil is as evil does' is a theme tricately woven throughout the (to date) four volumesRowlg has mastered the dficult task of wrg to all ages to children  adults alike  F though the grammar is f the most part simplistic  the prose uncomplicated the wld buildg the characterizations the build-up of suspense  the hlg of multiple plot threads are all deftly done Meover the wrg self is extremely accomplished   every volume there are small subtle asides wrten particularly f the me experienced mdset  It is no surprise then that these books have gaed their astonishg populary-like `Star Wars' (to cross-compare mediums) Harry Potter spans the generational gap  terms of entertament  overall composionIn `Goblet of Fire' the most recent  by far the largest of the series Rowlg troduces a whole slew of complications wh the wizard-wld framewk: new characters new suations  omous hts at Dark Ld Voldemt's evable resurrection A Tri-wizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts durg Harry's fourth year  two dferent schools arrive to present challengers  Meanwhile the students are fced to adjust to yet another Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher (their fourth so far)  Hermione Granger decides to campaign f the benefs of wage-slavesoops I mean house-elves everywhere  Harry Ron et all are gettg older  startg to notice the oppose sex faves from previous books also appear cludg Sirius Black Dobby the Elf  the befuddled Cnielius FudgeThe auth has stated that she plans on seven Harry Potter volumes altogether wh that  md  is easy to see how pivotal this particular episode is: the troductions have been made the conflict established  From this pot on nothg  Harry Potter's wld will be the same agaBrg on book 5!present challengers  Meanwhile the students are fced to adjust to yet another Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher (their fourth so far)  Hermione Granger decides to campaign f the benefs of wage-slavesoops I mean house-elves everywhere  Harry Ron et all are gettg older  startg to notice the oppose sex faves from previous books also appear cludg Sirius Black Dobby the Elf  the befuddled Cnielius FudgeThe auth has stated that she plans on seven Harry Potter volumes altogether wh that  md  is easy to see how pivotal this particular episode is: the troductions have been made the conflict established  From this pot on nothg  Harry Potter's wld will be the same agaBrg on book 5!
Like all other Harry Potter books this one proves to be just as hard to put down as the previous three It has the same charisma  's narrative that certa X-fact that keeps the reader wantg meOne of my favoure thgs about the Harry Potter novels is the wonderful feelg i get when i'm readg them How JK Rowlg is able to immerse you so well  the wld of Harry Potter than you actually feel slightly sad when the book is fished  your dumped back to realy aga This book is no exceptionThis book does debase mal values  i will adm therefe isn't very good f kids to read But  my opion i'd say &quotwho cares?&quot Sometimes rules have to be broken And  the case of The Goblet of Fire If broken rules meant a really enjoyable sty why not?I will adm that there are some loopholes  the plot but i didn't really notice them And  the case of a book liek this where 's ma purpose is to enterta these loopholes are perhaps negligible :)
When I started readg this book I had no idea I would get so caught up  all the action The way the auth chose to describe every ltle suation was credible It was like readg a script of a soon-to-become movie  makg  real  my headOne of the thgs that I didn't like was the amount of fantasy  this sty Most of the thgs that happened to Harry Potter would never be seen  our nmal everyday lives F example the talkg hat  the sudden populary f not gettg killed by an evil scerer In my opion JK Rowlgs must have a lot of imagation to come up wh this st of stuff The characteristics of Harry Potter is also a good of example of exaggeratg the part a hero plays I couldn't seem to fd any faults  his character only  his surroundgsAlthough Harry Potter was a flawless  perfect character the sty follows the stages of an epic sty He has two best friends  a giant who act as his ments always tryg to stop him from overcomg the challenges that are presented to him  this case preventg him to enter the TriWizards Tournament but  the end help him go through  all He has a couple of obstacles like his classmate Malfoy  his ma challenge: facg ld Voldemt once aga then savg the &iexcl¥wld&iexcl¦  returng to his everyday lestyleHarry Potter was wrten specically to enterta  I would recommend  just f that The book didn't make me thk at all  was just f pure entertament (which is good once  a while)
This is (possibly) my favoure novel  the series  defely the most accomplished as a piece of lerature:  is closer to beg an adult novel than any of s predecesss  has que a complex plot f a &quotchildren's&quot bookIt is by far the longest of the books to date which is excellent as  allows the plot to be developed  far greater detail  also allows f deeper characterisation This gives Rowlg the opptuny to describe her wld  even greater detail  makes f fascatg readg However the book is a lot darker than the others  at times is que creepy  verges on the hric (notably the chapter  which Harry confronts You-Know-Who (oh okay Valdemt!))  I feel younger readers might well be scared by this Such wrg  the length suggest that this book is marketed as much at adults as  is at childrenI will not repeat the plot here (as so many others have done that already) but I thoughly enjoyed this book even though  is darker than the rest We also see the begngs of what could be (will be?) a blossomg love terest between Ron  Hermione-- will she choose Harry stead? Or perhaps Cho Chang stead will capture the heart of Harry! Yes the wizard boys have discovered the oppose sex!We wa wh great anticipation  excement f the next book  der to see the answers to this ( other) mysteries
As wh her first three the fourth of the Harry Potter series is a great read f adults  children alike  Rowlg grabs you  doesn't ever let you goemotional highs  lows magic tragedy  comedy all nicely tied together wh a fast paced styBut she has real thgs to say to the adult reader  I completely disagree wh a recent review which said the only mal to the sty was that s okay to cheat sce everyone does  To the contrary beg true to oneself has laways been rewarded  this series  the current book is no exceptionAlso like much great lerature the book is also about lerature  Hogwarts is of course a book--a place of magic hidden fromthe rest of the wld where many thgs are possible  some rules need to be broken to keep thgs terestgBy the way Rowlg's description of prison is so accurate  makes one wonder who she has been talkg to  Prison does eventually leach away one's soul til you loose all touch wh realy  The dements are realCan't wa f book five--but what happens when we all fish seven?  I anticipate massive whdraw!
When I first got this book I was really exced because like all the other people who have read all the previous of the Harry Potter series I expected the fourth book to be just as good as the first three  also like other Harry Potter fans I thought &quotThe bigger the better&quot  Yet to my disappotment I really can't say that this book is &quotbetter&quot than the previous ones  even &quotas good&quot  First of all  was hard f me to get to the mood of the book at the begng  It may be because the last time I read  was 1-2 years ago but the begng of the book seemed a ltle unclear to me even a ltle confusg  And also unlike the 1st 3 a lot of the stuff  the book were que predictable  It ended up that towards the endg of the book ( last 80  so pages) I kept askg myself so when is Voldemt gonna show up? And I even started to suspect almost every character to have at least some connection wh him  And the endg was kd of sudden  left me hangg there not knowg what to expect  Nonetheless I must say that I too later on could not fce myself to put down this book eager to fd out the endg  Also this book compared to the first 3 stressed much me on emotions particularly love  sadness  And  went to much me depths of the characters lettg us underst me about their personalies  background  Despe the slight flaws  this book  is ultimately a great book that will lead you to a magical wld that no other book can do que as well
This book was very excg  It kept you wantg me  I never wanted  to end  Can't wa until book 5!!  :o}
Rowlg has never been a champion of havg characters play by the rules but  Goblet of Fire she goes even further  The ma plot revolves around the TriWizard tournament a wizardly contest between the champions of various schools  Harry does not solve one sgle element of the tournament whout eher cheatg  havg some cheat on his behalf - cludg enterg the tournament  the first place  To be fair at least Harry believes everyone else is cheatg too  Unftunately this seems to be the closest thg to a mal of the styRowlg's wld is losg some of s ternal consistency as well  If truth potions exist why is there a concern at all about who is a follower of Voldemt  who is not?  How can potions that second-year-students can whip together consistently confound the most brilliant wizards around on a long-term basis?  Why is Voldemt such a dangerous foe when he makes every classic bad-guy blunder known to man?  I was actually rootg f him by the end  The dumb-luck-that-saves-Harry-from-Voldemt this time is the cniest yet particularly when combed wh the collosal stupidy of Harry's enemies that was necessary to allow  to happenAzkaban had given me hope that this series might turn out well but this book has made me pessimistic aga
Granted I read a big chunk of the book at two  the mng while sick but I would still call this book the best of all four thus far  I can't wa f the 5th book to come out At 742 pages  so 's defely not a one-day read (unless of course you're a speed-reader  you read from eight  the mng until eight at night) but  *is* wth   JK Rowlg gets better wh every book she wres though parts of the book do drag just slightly  And I'm not sure where the idea of Harry likg Cho is comg from  All  all an excellent read  wth five stars
I've never read a series of books  which I was COMPLETELY IMMERSED  the sty  characters  even me so wh each book!!  Have you ever read a book where you want to reach to that book  help the lead character?  Comft that character ( friends) when he/she needs   pot them away from danger!?  Read Harry Potter then  This started out as a curiousy f me  I fell  love wh this sty  the characters  I could not put the books down!!  I would s up 7 hours at a time  just read!  I fished all 4  2 weeks  And I CAN NOT wa f the 5th!  Remarkable sty JK Rowlg has wrten here  Beg a huge fan of fantasy wizards the magical wld I have NEVER read a sty this good!!  I'm 26  can tell you that no matter what age you are you'll love ! All 4 books get 5 stars!  Remember everyone needs a ltle magic  their lives brg Harry Potter to yours!!
As a 15 year-old I pride myself  havg grown up surrounded by lerature I have read The Chronicals of Narnia  the Ld of the Rgs trilogy both which have been compared to Harry Potter When my mom first gave me the books I was skeptical because they seemed like they were childish  I wasn't terested I put them on my shelf  they sat there nearly 3 months until I fally picked them up one ray day I read the four books  nearly 3 days The moment I fished the first I picked up the seconed By the fourth I was anticipatg a very good read  I certaly wasn't dissappoted Rowlg has delivered a fabulous style  a magical new wld While other books are a b redundant these never dissapot This book starts out wh Harry at the Dursley's where they are beg as unfair  cruel as ever Harry gets ved to attend the Quiddch Wld Cup wh Ron At the match a group of death eaters show up to frighten everyone As Harry  his friends retreat to the woods they see a Dark Mark conjured  the sky The Dark Mark is the sign of Voldemt This is just the start of everythg that is gog to happen to Harry this year The end will come as a real surprise   will set the stage f a very dark end of the series There is also romance brewg among the characters which just demonstrates Rowlgs abily to grow wh her fans  will also make a great side-plot By the end of the 4th book I was swelled up wh emotions of anger  sadness  I am amazed that she could ptray these emotions  such a believable way I am now eagerly anticipatg the release of the fth book Bottom le: Despe a lot of cricism of the hype surroundg these books these are a must read I loved them!
Another stallment of adventure  fantasy delightful characters  rivettg battles between good  evil While I fd  dficult to believe those who thk HP &quotpromotes&quot wchcraft  deviltry have actually read the books I would note a wd of warng f parents of the young  sensive readers of any age that the verbally graphic depiction of one character cuttg off his own h to make a blood sacrice to resurrect another is truly a tense  frighteng passage that may well produce nightmares  Please note this is an evil character dog what is clearly presented as an evil thg bravery  goodness do prevailThese are not simple books  Adults read them f your own enjoyment -  to guide your children
A true wk of art The best one of the four It is well wrten has a great plot  even though  is not exactly happy  has a hopeful endgYou cannot go on whout readg  !!!!
Once aga I was kept spellbound by the newest Harry Potter book The Goblet of Fire New teachers at Hogwarts new mysteries to unravel  the same old gang also The books take me away  all are excg to read The Goblet is longer but took me no time at all to fish I am on bated breath wag f number five!
Harry does  aga by capturg his reader wh his sty at Hogwarts
I was a ltle disappoted The Goblet of Fire merely picked the ones enterg the Triwizard Tournament (a series of task you must complete) Nothg magical here I really thk I should've given  4 but  wasn't what I was anticipatg Many people say 's the best but stick wh #3 The best reason to buy  is the contuienty (I can't spell) F stance The Order of the Pheonix might be good
Given Rowlg's past track recd  wasn't too surprisg to open this novel to fd over 700 pages of text each Harry book up to now has been successively longer bigger  scope  arguably better  Who knows maybe by the time that we arrive at the seventh  fal novel we'll have somethg twice as gr as Vict Hugo's masterpiece on  redemption--at least  size  Harry Potter is first  femost a children's sty  as a result 's highly unlikely that we'll see s auth usg  as a platfm on which to discuss her view on the vice  folly of the wld as much as we may like to thk that she's begng to cater to her adult audience wh each passg novel  Everythg here  sht is still as  always was but just  bigger dosesThe front flap of the novel does good on callg this a pivotal stallment  the Harry Potter universe however Our youngadventurers are now begng to get a taste of the growg pas associated wh adolescence so much of the nocence of the12-year-olds that we've been subjected to up to now begs to gradually abrade as the pages draw by The olderaudience-- presumably the -growg- audience--will probably fd that this makes  easier to relate to the characters  thus the immersion fact of the sty is turned up several very very fceful notchesStrangely enough I was left flabbergasted near the fal pages of the novel when the me "pivotal" element of this book actually made s presence felt  Had this never taken place I would have been me than satisfied happy to look fward to the next stallmentBut this isn't to say that the novel is entirely perfect like the last two stallments  The ma mystery of this sty is largely unfulfillg probably because we don't learn what Rowlg is even tryg to get at until full disclosure comes near the end of the book  In hdsight the suations now all seem very erratically nerve-wreckg  but the first time through  felt as though everybody was simply runng around  the dark wh some secret agenda  sce none of these characters were fleshed out enough f me to care I found myself payg me attention to the puerile deliciously adolescent woes of Harry  his friendsThere's also two notes of terest that should probably be brought up  One is that the book apparently must have missed the ed's desk f there was not a sgle sentence  which the wd "oh" was followed by a comma (some of the other errs are passable but the "Oh I didn't know"'s  "Oh I guess"'s get particularly tirg sce Rowlg seems to have developed a strong penchant f that two-letter wd--'s used about three times per page)  Second is that the book begs wh some very crass adolescent hum--the narrative avoids this as the characters beg to grow me serious but I'd advise care while parents read about breezes  private areas  "Uranus" to their children  bedI surmise that "The Goblet of Fire" will probably come to be looked upon as the changg pot  the chronicle of Harry Potter's le all dications pot toward a new improved fmula  Whout a doubt the fk that is so eloquently woven to the fal chapters bellows that now is the time to get ready f the real adventure to beg  sce Rowlg hasn't disappoted  any of her three follow-ups I fd no reason to fear the future  If anythg we'll probably be treated to me of what we've been nibblg on until now   that turns out to be the case I certaly won't be one to compla--these books are me enrapturg than veelas themselvesreckg  but the first time through  felt as though everybody was simply runng around  the dark wh some secret agenda  sce none of these characters were fleshed out enough f me to care I found myself payg me attention to the puerile deliciously adolescent woes of Harry  his friendsThere's also two notes of terest that should probably be brought up  One is that the book apparently must have missed the ed's desk f there was not a sgle sentence  which the wd "oh" was followed by a comma (some of the other errs are passable but the "Oh I didn't know"'s  "Oh I guess"'s get particularly tirg sce Rowlg seems to have developed a strong penchant f that two-letter wd--'s used about three times per page)  Second is that the book begs wh some very crass adolescent hum--the narrative avoids this as the characters beg to grow me serious but I'd advise care while parents read about breezes  private areas  "Uranus" to their children  bedI surmise that "The Goblet of Fire" will probably come to be looked upon as the changg pot  the chronicle of Harry Potter's le all dications pot toward a new improved fmula  Whout a doubt the fk that is so eloquently woven to the fal chapters bellows that now is the time to get ready f the real adventure to beg  sce Rowlg hasn't disappoted  any of her three follow-ups I fd no reason to fear the future  If anythg we'll probably be treated to me of what we've been nibblg on until now   that turns out to be the case I certaly won't be one to compla--these books are me enrapturg than veelas themselves
I just fished this After three hours I could NOT put  down -  the sheer size of the book delighted me  seems that as the characters mature so do the books themselves This stallment is *defetely* my favoure out of the four  my only regret is that now I shall have to wa wh the rest of the wld f Book Five - this one is most defetly a clfhanger  leaves a LOT of questions floatg  the air both f the casual reader  f the one that notices the small details  the books Very much a stunng conclusion to the first half of the series  highly recommended

I am very shocked at how some people thk of this book I mean I always knew there were weirdos out there who thk Harry Potter is dangerouspeople who thk that  puts bad ideas to kids' mds There is nothg terrible about these books It's fantasy  some people don't have any imagation to believe   Just because the book says somethg doesn't mean that 's real I read about some fool kid who jumped off his house's roof on a broom because the book said brooms flew HONESTLY! It's fantasy people 's not real! I also read about some girl who was so scared of the books that she had nightmares f a month Obviously she wasn't old enough not to be scared so why were they read to her  why did she read them? They are thrillg  chillg but not scary! Someone else said that the only people who read Harry Potter are people who are uneducated don't pay attention  class  slackers who need somethg to read f a summer readg list at the last second NOT TRUE! I'm a sixth grader a straight-A student  I don't procrastate All of my friends are the same  we ade Harry Potter  s capturg sty JK Rowlg has really outdone herself   shows! We all expect somethg as perfect f the fth book  we're sure  will deliver!
Sce I first bought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire one week after  came out was so fun to read AnywayI love to read but I was totally sure my brother was gog to really like  he doesn't read books that long!  This book has so much crammed to  you will never want to stop readg  It amazed me how she could f spts magic frendship bravery loyalty school monsters  the occasional gillyweed to one fantastic book!
I have read book four over  over aga as I wa f the upcomg book five This book was fun  excg as the previous books that I have read of the Harry Potter Series I cannot wa till the next book of the series arrives:)
I'm one of the 4000 reviewers who enjoys &quotHarry Potter&quot books The books are clever imagative descriptive  excg There is one caution I agree wh that was astutely poted out by a Nov 22 2001 reviewer from Engl who suggested that parents take the trouble to expla to children Harry's ltle lyg cheatg  breakg the rules when he thks he needs to That's the only problem I saw wh the books But nothg is perfect Right? These are all great fictional sties presented wh the framswk of fantasy F those who enjoy fantasy I would also recommend you read while wag f &quotHarry Potter - Book 5&quot a ltle known book that does the same thg --- except the sties presented wh the framewk of fantasy are true sties that have educational benef toward teachg character  leadership The book is called &quotWest Pot&quot by Nman Thomas Remick  I got a tip about  from another &quotHarry Potter&quot reader who said  kd of picks up on what JK Rowlg had Dumblede say to Harry at the end of Book 4 namely choose the dficult right from the easy wrong I'm readg  while breathlessly wag to see what JK Rowlg comes up wh next  Book 5 And I assume  is wrten exclusively by her? Please no &quotghost&quot wrers We want  to be all JK Rowlg!
A very detailed book wh some adult wds that help readers to acquire a better vocabulary  I personally also bought all the unabridged tapes of all four books  am delighted wh how Jim the reader is able to change his voice f each of the characters  This also helps draw a slow reader to the sty as they read along wh the book by troducg how the wds are pronounced  JKRowlg deserves applause from me f how she leads up to the recreation of Valdamt (hope I spelled this right)  Any estimate on the 5th year  Holbart's School f Wizards?
In this fourth  (at this pot) last Harry Potter book the theme seems to focus on matury  Not only has Harry  his friends showg signs of growg up but Rowlgs has assumed her readers are maturg as wellEasily the darkest of the four novels this may too tense f the younger readers  the series  The effects of evil are much clearer than  the past novels:  the viciousness of Voldemt  other villas are much me pronouncedAlso clear is that not all threats come from the truly evil  The fces of ignance - embodied  particular by Ra Skeeter  the Dursleys - provide another peril that abets the me obvious villasThere is a depth  plot  character ( a page count) that are unusual  a novel aimed towards children  This shows Rowlgs's talent  willgness to assume the best  her audience  The nice thg is that her assumption seems to be true
Lets get this straight right from the begng The Harry Potter series is NOT just f young childrenHavg read all these books I rate Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire very well As far as books go not many characters have been developed as well as HarryHarry is a character who many young  old can relate to And to those people who thk so Harry is not evil but a pretty good role-model f the younger generation to followHarry as a character is easy to relate to Rowlg has done a magnicent job on Harry here Most wrers tend to focus on the physical aspect of thgs Rowlg has kept that reaonably simple (Black messy hair glasses scar) In fact what makes Harry special is the way that the reader can see him The kid who was victimised at school Spurned by his last remag family Harry is a boy who many recognise but few actually knowIn fact go to your local high school to the year 7 classroom You will see your Harrys Rons  Hermiones You will also see your Malfoys  SnapesIt is the magic of the characters rather than what comes out the end of Harry's w that brgs the book together  gives the series a followg The plot is well thought out beckong you to turn the next pageJK Rowlg has said that there is a b of Harry  her I'm not surprised there's a b of Harry  all of us In fact  I was to relate closely to any of the characters  the series myself  would be Harry The fact that some young children have called me Harry Potter is another sty altogether(*)(*) Auth of review 18 yo Engeerg student
As Harry grows older this is his fourth year at Hogwarts School so the level of his books matures  grows  complexy  what they ask of the reader The previous three were enjoyable but this was the best so far complicated compellg  charmg wh a plot that could not be stopped If you thk that that Harry Potter series is just variations of the theme of the first two books you're sellg yourself  Rowlg sht Keep wh   make sure you get to Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire You won't be sry!
Reluctant as I was to readg the 4th book  the Harry Potter series - also because I knew there wouldn't be another one to follow  immediately but mostly because of s size - the efft to read through the somewhat slow begng  to allow myself to be engulfed by the sty completely paid offI was avidly agast Harry Potter befe I gave  to curiosy  picked up the first book (maybe because of all the hype that lays around ) but rarely have my stcts had such a pleasant turnout I immediately became volved wh the sties  could not get a rest until I fished the last bookJKRowlg deserves every b of praise she gets f her creation simply because of the fact that she has the gt to surround you wh the sty  make you feel like you're one of the characters while allowg the reader to grow wh the sty &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot contas all the emotion  adventure that graces the other books but reaches a new level of &quotmatury&quot now dealg wh me serious subjects such as death  blossomg love (this particular style however brief is absolutely endearg)4 thumbs up (hs  feet) f JKRowlg the book  Harry Potter  his 4th year  Hogwarts
I just fished readg this book  I have to tell you that  was really good Also that  was as good as any other harry potter book It had a good climax  the auth knew what she was dog
I have read all of the Harry Potter books that have been published  the series so far I just fished Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I thought that  was the best I have read so far The tesy of this book is wonderful I couldn't put  down The mystery  suspense throughout the Triwizard Tournament that Harry is fced to is unreal I was shocked at Harry's human courage as he fought Ld Voldemt  I can't wa to fd out me  the next book
I have found myself completely hooked my Harry Potter  The first three books really sparked my terest but this 4th book caused me to break out to emotional outburst  say a few wds that I cannot type here  Me than the others this book pulled me to an emotional attachment wh the sty  seeg that &quotHe-who-must-not-be-named&quot is returng to power had me shaken  It didn't help that I went outside after five hours of non-stop readg too see that  was dark gloomy  foggy outside my apartment  Be prepaid to spend some time  you start readg this book because you won't want to stop unl you are fished   you are like me you'll be wishg the 5th book was out already
I've read all 4 Potter books This is defely not the best one but  you have read all of them you'll enjoy  I prefer the second  third ones I'm already wag f the 5th
I never planned on readg this series but my oldest told me they were a quick read  I read the first few chapters of the first book  got hookedThis is by far the best  longest of the four books  If you've not read the others you MUST read them first just so you will get the background out of the way The subsequent sties build upon the previous one(s) As  the previous books Rowlg is very descriptive  detailg everythg that happens the characters  their environment  Envisiong the sty unfold through her wds is very easy  The book was a real page turner  I stayed up late tryg to get  &quotjust one me chapter&quot  I lost a lot of sleep over this oneI saw the movie translation of the first book  was generally pleased wh   However some aspects could not be put on the big screen  Much of the charm hum  character ner thoughts were left out (not to mention a lot of other stuff even though  was 25 hours long)I recommend readg the books  skippg the movies  The books will be way me satisfyg  One wd of caution:  Rowlg is Brish  wres like  so some of the language may need decipherg (treacle fudge?)
Okay I adm  - I bought the first Harry Potter book f my daughter but now they're f me as well  Each book seems to outdo the one befe   Can't wa f the next one!
After all of the magic  fantasy books I have read this one has  all From mystery to mayhem  romance to rebirth no one could ask f a better book
I thk my fave Harry Potters have been the first  the third so far  They have been light hearted  eventful  have dealt wh comg of age issues  a way that captures the terest of an adult whout losg the terest of a child  I can't image a better set of bedtime readg books to share wh children even as old as 10  12 yearsHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the fourth  the series is another good one but I found  dficult to get to after the first chapter  The characters are aga some of them charmg some of them trigug  the settg just as wondrous as  the other books but here the narrative seemed to wer  After a wonderful  arrestg openg the book seemed to stall out  The gap between the almost Agatha Christie openg  the by now almost banal Qwiddich match left one wonderg what the pot of the whole thg was  Rowlg's sties heretofe have been fast movg wh few digressions  a tapestry of characters whose roles have been fairly clear cut even when they have been designed to throw the reader off the track  (One is used to the latter device when one has read enough murder mysteries)  Here  takes almost 500 pages befe their purpose  the sty becomes clear  In fact  took the device of the Pensieve to brg the plot aga to focus f meWhile  took me mutes to read the first chapter  I was riveted aga from chapter 29 to the end the 28 chapters  between took me almost two months to get through  In fact I only persisted because I was certa that the end would make them somehow me pertent   did  Unlike Rawlg's previous three books the chapters  this one seemed to lack the connectg suspense that kept me movg from one to the next  der to fd out &quotwhat happened next&quot  I could easily set the book aside at the end of a chapter  not get back to  f days where previous books had been fished  a sgle dayI still thk these are charmg books wh much to say to everyone  I can't image not havg a complete collection especially f a family wh young children but  I thk that this book is defely the one f which I'd wa f the paperback edion  a lower price befe addg r />I still thk these are charmg books wh much to say to everyone  I can't image not havg a complete collection especially f a family wh young children but  I thk that this book is defely the one f which I'd wa f the paperback edion  a lower price befe addg 
People seem to often say they don't underst why the Harry Potter series is so popular  I thk 's blatantly obvious  Harry Potter is universal filled wh glious characters  also wh characters so digustg you wonder why they're that way  Each Harry Potter book has a mal  the mal  THE GOBLET OF FIRE is the strongest one the series has to offer  JK Rowlg has the wonderful abily to give the reader enough details to give him/her an idea of the sty but few enough details to let our imagations soar  Although I'm 15 years old this simple children's book is still very relatable to me
I never review books but this book was one of the most fantastic books I've read  The emotional ties to the characters is almost unbelievable  The entire Harry Potter series is somethg that is magical   of self but this last book was the best so far  JK Rowlg never lets a reader down  I  other fans of her wk appreciate that they can follow Harry Potter's adventures due to her superb wrg
I was not a seasonal fictional book reader until I started readg this series (I only read non-fictions)  I bought the first book because of all the hypes surroundg  Befe I knew  i fished readg all 4 books wh 2 weeks F a 27 years old I love the darker tone of book 4 but I would fd  frighteng f anyone under the age of 8  I would recommend parents who would read f their kids to ed out the &quotdeath&quot wd This is an credible book  I don't want any kids to miss out on  just because some parents fd certa scenes too scary
In my opion &quotThe Chamber of Secrets&quot was by far the better of the first three books  when I began readg &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot I thought that beg me than 700 pages was me of a detriment than an advantage However as surprisg as  truly is this book reads faster than the first though   me than two  a half times longerThe plot is mysterious adventrous  fun  the conclusion is downright frighteng Also the characters are much older  this one  have me abilies than  the previous three which makes  all the me terestgI'll defely be  le to buy part five openg day  hope  lives up to this one though I do thk that that's close to impossible &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is the most rewardg of the four by far  I'll be the first to adm that I've been pulled to the phenomenon of Harry Potter after years of refusg to read these books
I igally purchased all 4 of the Harry Potter books f my son  Beg a firm believer that the &quotbook is usually better than the movie&quot I decided to re-read &quotThe Scerer's Stone&quot befe seeg the film  Well  the past two weeks I have read all 4 books  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot has certaly been my fave  Not only are there the usual twists  turns that we have come to expect from the &quotHarry&quot series but there is also a good deal of character development as Harry  his friends mature  The endg defely leaves you wantg me  F those who feel that Harry moves through the wld unscathed  whout emotional baggage he certaly picks  up  this sty  My one concern is that wh the cheerful picture of Harry on the cover younger readers may thk that this is another light hearted sty of the young wizard  Probably any child below 10 years will alternately be bed by the character development  hried at the endg  However I would strongly recommend  to older children  adults  Not sce the Tolkien series have I been so drawn to a wld of fantasy  imagation  I especially like Dumblede's summation at the end of the book&quotwhen you are given the choice of dog what is right  what is easy&quot  Harry contues to do what is right  so does the auth
Hey everyone! The fourth book is so far the best! It really is detailed  has a great clfhanger  surprise endg Leaves you wantg me
Unlike the me mature fantasies of CS Lewis's classic Nara books  Kg  Straub's Talisman which depict schools as deadeng embodiments of progressive aridy Rowlg show's them as ptals to enchantment rather then as an evil to escape from somethg which undersces her &quothero's&quot essential preppy sensibily &amp vapidy
Just like the 3rd book  made me thk about the true identy of a person  From the consistent topic  Sharekespear we shouldn't judge someone from appreance  I wonder  Dumblede is really good person  what kd of person profess Snape is (he contued to look like a villian from the first volume but he showed he sticks to the good side agast Voldermt)  From this book there seems to be a begng of romance   is appropriate to tell f children's book (but I thk 's ok  Romance is about love isn't ?)  I wonder what Ron feel f Hermione  Hermione thk of Harry  I wonder when the fth book will be published  what kd of sty  proceeds wh clues thrown  previous onesThough Harry smiled on the cover I was sad when readg the last page Why was that honest  brave boy killed because he was on the way of Voldermt  (I received an e-mail askf  Harry was killed  Of course not  Whout Harry how the auth can wre the seriese to 7th volume?  If I mentioned the po boy's name 's like a foul to say the killer's name  mystery movie to the persons who don't watch the movie)  Sometimes the good  nocent are sacriced  realy  That's sad
Amazgly the Harry Potter series gets even better wh The Goblet of Fire Rowlg weaves another masterpiece  the Harry saga I have read all 4  a recommend them to anyone This book is credible I highly suggest you pay the money f  It is wth 
Thgs start to happen  book 4  Serious thgs  This lives up to the claim of beg the turng pot book of the series  Not only are Harry Ron  Hermione growg up (Ron suddenly notices Hermione's a girl  Hermione dates famous quiddch player Vikt Krum) this book signies Ld Voldermt's return  It's a must read although be sure to keep this out of the hs of anyone younger than 8  The Harry Potter series is one of the best series I have ever read  JK Rowlg has talent beyond belief f keepg not only children readg but teens  adults as well  F all those who thk this book is heathen come off   go back to readg the bible that's glued to your h  You are missg out on one of the best book series everThis is defately not a fad
It's just too hard to pick a fave But I will tell you the endg of this book had me GLUED to the pages (Well I wasn't lerally stuck to them You know what I mean) I am a very picky reader (I'm also an adult - yes I am over 21  have a Harry Potter tattoo on my h as I type) These books have grabbed me like no others I love the fact that the lead characters are not snotty brats I love the fact that when they're gettg to trouble 's nearly always f a greater good  not f themsevles I love the fact that JK Rowlg keeps our characters telligent  does not talk down to us the readers When Harry gets on the Hogwart's Express I feel I am personally  f an adventure of a letime! Highly recommended f adults  children
()After readg the fourth book I was let down a b The first three were so great (The first  third were my faves the second was a ltle strange but  was good)  this one seemed to drag on It didn't seem like there was much content f the lenght  to me the book read as   hadn't even seen an ed I thk that J K Rowlg is rushg to wre them  I thk that's a big mistake ()Over all this book was pretty good but I do hope the next is better ()
Beg 19 years old I thought I'd never like a sty like Harry's I thought  was f ltle children But as soon as I read the first page I knew I was mistaken I couldn't stop readg   I swear I fell  love wh every sgle character of the sty This book made me believe  fantasy aga Sometimes I ask to myself &quotwhy isn't this sty true?&quot &quotwhy doesn't Hogwarts really exsist?&quot but after some seconds I realise  DOES existst  the deepest of my heart
Harry is enterg his fourth year at Hogwarts There are two big events comg up  The first is the Wld Quiddch Fals held just befe term starts  The match is between Bulgaria  Irel  After the match Voldemt's sign is seen  the sky  the masked Death Eaters go on a rampage  When term begs a tournament between the threee most proment wizardg schools is announced  Only wizards seventeen  older are eligible  Somehow thirteen year old Harry's name is put to the goblet  he is part of the contestThis is by far the longest of the Potter books  a great deal is happeng throughout  I am gog to read  aga to see what I missed the first time  As always these books are entertag the sty le is consistent  there is great attention to detail  Great books f young  old alike
It is a shame that Harry Potter is marketed primarily to children  I'm 38  after seeg the movie wh my 5  9 year old daughters decided to read the next book (Chamber of Secrets)  the series Needless to say I got totally sucked   by the end of the week had bought the entire series  read them all My 9 year old is followg su but not gettg through que as fastAlthough even the first book (Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone) was very good I felt that each subsequent book got better The Goblet of Fire was easily the best the 700+ pages went  a flash  I was left wh serious whdrawal symptoms  I heard that Amazoncom had to hire 9000 staff  Fedex reserved 100 planes just to ship the pre-ders on this book  I'm sure that these numbers will double wh the next bookRowlgs really knows how to wre  a way that transpts you to a magical wld  your md  But despe the magicial settg the human teractions  behaviour are realistic  easy to identy wh  I saw many parallels wh my childhood experiences  boardg school  EnglF those who have not read all the previous books I would suggest that you read each book  the series  ther crect der sce some of elements of the credible endg twists  the earlier books are referred to  the later books
This book is the best book I have ever read!!! I have currently re-read the book about 20 times This book has constant action  dares the reader to contue to read me JK Rowlg has some imagation because I have nver seen a book even equal how tenative I was to this book I wish everyone had the chance to sucomb to Ms Rowlgs fantay Great charecters  Harry has the perfect personaly In the book just hearg about Harry havg to live wh the Durselys made me feel sry f him I wish that I had even half the imagation of Ms Rowlg Also a comment on the movie to the first book I thk they picked a really good act f Harry Daniel Radclfe he ptrays Harry down to the last deatail Thank you-miss Angela Howlage 13Future auth

All I have to say is that this book is absolutely amazg I didn't catch onto the Harry Potter phenomenon until after the 3rd book was released Then  7th grade  1999 I read all three of the books  one week  started eagerly anticipatg the 4th! I have to say I was not disappoted!

I'm 25  a graduate student Still I love Harry Potter as any of his young fans ( not me) To me the style keeps me exced  engrossed  the readg process but the deeper messages passed by Rowlg  her books makes me ponder even long after I read them Young readers thk about questions like&quotwhat makes a successful person -- bravery telligence  diligence  ambion?&quot&quotIn face of hardship what do you choose -- the easy way  the right way?&quot&quotShould anyone be superi because of his/her looks wealth class  should there be somethg deeper as the stard?&quot&quotShould people be given a second chance  should you trust them?&quotI can already see this is becomg a really *dull* review f many of you out there But I'm just wrg them out  hope of makg the most of readg Rowlg If you could keep these questions  md when you read Harry Potter  when you deal wh real le You may fd you ga much me than just readg the best sties  the wld
Don't let the thickness of this book timidate you!  You still will not want  to end  If you have read the first three then this one won't dissapot you   is arguably Rowlg's best to date  The book transpts you to Harry's wld  takes you right along f the ride  It is fantastic  s imagery  action  Enjoy!
Loved the first three books  This fourth one seems to have been rushed to prt befe edg  Much could be removed to distill  to as good a book as the first three
I cannot even beg to describe why this book is credible  md blowg It was heart-wrenchg nerve-wrackg suspensful  down right freaky creepy  a b scary at times In other wds: AMAZING Defetly a must read
My 15 yr old daughter was dog a school project on banned books  asked me to read the first onewell by the end of the week I had completed ALL four  the series  I am eargerly awag the 5thAND I will be gog to see the movie! The only people who do not enjoy these booksare people wh NO imagation
This is  my opion the best book of the series  (So far)  JK Rowlg warned us fans that the books would become darker over the course of Harry's years at Hogwarts  she was right  I thk she is movg  the right direction  I best enjoyed how all the characters are growg up  startg to act like   They're dealg wh me complicated thgs than mean relatives  not havg any friends  Le gets hard after a while  's even harder f Harry  JK does a fantastic job of showg how one boy's le is changg fever  I can only hope that Book 5 will be as good as Book 4  not better
JK Rowlg never ceases to amaze me  Imagation creativy magic  surprises take center stage  the fourth stallment of Harry Potter   proves once aga that Harry simply gets better wh ageNever a dull moment at Hogwarts  This year somethg dferent is on the hizon  has all the Hogwarts students giddy wh excement  This &quotsomethg&quot comes  the fm of the Triwizard Tournament a competion of skill  bravery between three rival wizardg schools  Only one champion per school is allowed  Harry is too young to compete  But someone somewhere has  out f Harry  concocts a plan that turns his fourth year completely upside down wh fatal consequencesHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is me mature  humous than the previous three but does not devalue the adventure  magic that has become s trademark  The endg will twist turn  surprise you  You thk you know but really you have NO idea!  I am eagerly anticipatg the next book  I'm already  whdrawls
In the last week I have enjoyed the first four Harry Potter books  this is my absolute fave  The book is very clever  well wrten  I recommend  to everyone as a *must* read
This book is so far the best I have read every book twice  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best There is everythg   Quiddch fightg Voldemt s scary  there is alot of thkg volved O yeah once u start readg you wont put  down even  you dont belive me ask anyone Everyone knows about harry potter
A few thgs echog on the sentiments of other reviews:1 Sty: sure these books are predictable -- we know Harry will w every time But the joy of this series is not the outcome but the journey -- HOW he ws That's what makes Harry Potter so enjoyable to read  what makes this fourth book the best yet (#3 was also great as was #1#2 was the weakest  my opion) His hurdles become greater each time  so does the reader's appreciation of his accomplishments2 Plot twists: we've all come to expect that there will be some st of plot twistnevertheless the specics of this plot twist always take me by surprise (except of course when curiosy gets the better of me  I read ahead) I never see the specic betrayal comg even though I know there will be one In this book the betrayal (I won't give  away) had me floed -- there were so many red herrgs I didn't know who to trust ( not to trust) Maybe I'm just gullible I hope I'm as gullible f the next 3 stallments3 Characters: I thk the trio is gettg me  me dferentiated Hermione is becomg an dependent woman wh a love terest Ron is becomg not just Harry's best friend but someone who is searchg f his own place  the wld And Harry still the reluctant hero is dealg wh his fears  new ways So I would disagree wh anyone who says that the POV  this sty is muddled -- on the contrary I now have an even greater sense of the dferences  these characters  an even keener terest  seeg how they turn outAnd that's  Keep up the great wk Ms Rowlg You're not only wrg great sties but you're gettg people of all ages to READ
The Harry Potter books have a devoted adult followg  I recommend the series highly  Each book builds wonderfully upon the others  As Harry gets older the books grow  complexy  tackle broader  me dficult themes  Fabulously fun  entertag  Don't pick any of the Harry Potter books up until you have a signicant amount of time to devote to readg them because you will not want to put them down  Enjoy!

Once aga - the magical wld is back  our own livg rooms I enjoyed this book as much as s three predecesss But the playfulness  &quotlightness&quot of this magical wld is gone - the Dark Magic is fally resurrected  this fairy tale of wizards  wches turnes defely darkerTherefe I was surprised to see that this book is still recommended f kids  the age of 9 - 12 Personally I would not give this book to kids under 12 My tip: take time  the eveng  read  together
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire by JK Rowlg is fantastic sty that reveals many dferent aspects of lerature First Rowlg uses flashbacks to help the reader ht at Harry Potter's miraculous birth Next many of the characters can be considered foils such as Hermione Granger  Neville Longbottom Potter  Draco Malfoy These characters are exact opposes of each other   Potter  Malfoy's case are there f enemies Fally Rowlg's use of stereotype categizes the wizards from the `muggles' Rowlg has shown through this enchantg tall tale a simple yet delightful sty When Harry first encounters Ld Voldemt he is an fant  his mother's arms Voldemt tries to kill Potter but his mother's love prevents this Potter often has flashbacks of this moment wonderg what  means  why he gets them Eventually Potter learns that when Voldemt is near these spltg headaches  flashbacks to his fancy occur Wh each flashback the reader can learn me about his mother's dyg love f him Granger  Longbottom Potter  Malfoy are all complete opposesGranger is an telligent wizard that really applies herself to her studies She tries to achieve everythg overwhelmg herself wh too many classes But she is naturally the fave among all of the teachers Where as Longbottom is constantly messg a potion  spell up causg disasters  the classroom He tries very hard but can never qu master what the other students accomplish naturally Potter  Malfoy are not only foils but also wst enemies Potter is a popular wizard not to mention a wldwide hero among the wizards Potter is allowed to do thgs that other wizards his age cannot such as play on the Quiddch team Draco on the other h is a bully that is despised by most wizards He is evil  cannot be on the Quiddch team  participate  the Tri-Wizard Tournament like Potter Malfoy is  evil wizard compared to Potter who is a good wizard tryg to only perfm good clean magic Foils allow the reader to comprehend to characters at the same time by comparg their dferences Fally Rowlg shows the wizards' dferent stereotype upon the muggles  non-wizards The wizards  the novel often refer to muggles They shun upon them seeg them as unequal If any wizard has muggle parents they are made fun of bterly This shows how sometimes we can stereotype people because of their race  religion But Rowlg uses Hermione as a "half muggle" to show that she is impure  the eyes of others but can still perfm the spells better than most wizards her age The use of lerary devices  this novel helps the reader underst the book Flashbacks directly help the reader determe what did happen It allows the sty to contue but still get that glimpse of the past The use of foils also helps better underst the character  their part  the sty When Potter  Malfoy meet we know Malfoy is gog to be the antagonist tryg to fce Potter to mess Fally the stereotypes that the muggles receive from the wizards teach us that our stereotypes are wrong  can hurt somebody Rowlg helped the reader wh these simple yet direct ways to give the readers cluesPotter who is a good wizard tryg to only perfm good clean magic Foils allow the reader to comprehend to characters at the same time by comparg their dferences Fally Rowlg shows the wizards' dferent stereotype upon the muggles  non-wizards The wizards  the novel often refer to muggles They shun upon them seeg them as unequal If any wizard has muggle parents they are made fun of bterly This shows how sometimes we can stereotype people because of their race  religion But Rowlg uses Hermione as a "half muggle" to show that she is impure  the eyes of others but can still perfm the spells better than most wizards her age The use of lerary devices  this novel helps the reader underst the book Flashbacks directly help the reader determe what did happen It allows the sty to contue but still get that glimpse of the past The use of foils also helps better underst the character  their part  the sty When Potter  Malfoy meet we know Malfoy is gog to be the antagonist tryg to fce Potter to mess Fally the stereotypes that the muggles receive from the wizards teach us that our stereotypes are wrong  can hurt somebody Rowlg helped the reader wh these simple yet direct ways to give the readers clues
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  my opion is the best book so far  the series  unlike the other three the books endg isn't  s nmal happess  i guess i can best describe  as the Empire Strikes Back of Harry Potter   i can't help but fear that the next book will also end the same way  the sty will end  kd of a shock to most people because those that you thought were your friends turn out to be enemies but then all four books have been that way when you thk about well i believe that JK Rowlg is a great wrer  i hope she keeps up the series even after Harry leaves Hogwarts  i am glad i fally broke down  read these books because i can honestly say that they are better than the Ld of the Rgs
As a retired person I want to say I enjoy this series as much as children  This is what entertament is all about  If I could give this book a 10 star ratg I would ()
This book was missg somethg  even today I still don't know what  is I thk the reason I didn't like this book as much as the others is because  didn't have the Harry Potter type adventure That's what I loved about the other books   didn't have  the way  used to I was dissapoted  
this book was amazg! There was so much imagation   that  was burstg at the seams wh creativy! I highly recomend this book f people of all ages This book makes you believe  hope f thgs beyond what we can comprehend
When you first thk of the Harry Potter series the first thought that comes to md is &quotWhy do I want to read a book about Wizards?&quot Well first off this was my reaction but i ended up readg   It happened to be the best book i ever read You are taken to an enchantg wld of wizardrywhere the le of a young boy Harry Potter tensies your md Harry Potter is the only wizard ever to have defeated the dark fces  although he appears nocent to this fact the dark wizard is planng a return  When everythg is gog so well f Harry thgs take a turn when an unexpected surprise comes out of the mysterious Goblet of Fire  As the book contues you are drawn to the secury of Harry's le while also the enchantment of magic  Image gog to a school where they taught you how to perfm tricks! Or how about meetg a three-eyed dog? And best yet Have you ever heard of socc beg played on broomsticks up  the air?  It's the ltle thgs like these that make Harry Potter the book  is  Filled wh mystery tensy  fun  Harry Potter will take you to a wld so magical you will never look at le the same way aga!

This book can be said to be the most predictable harry potter yet   seems to be the only one that drags on  a couple of places But other than that JKR has wrten  masterpiece Though the plot isn't as engrossg as the previous books (book three is the best  this categy)  is fairly terestgIn sht the the endg is this Harry potter take on The Dark Ld  ws Not really a suprise is This book is rated a 4 not f 's plot but everythg else that makes up the book from the characters to the mood In sht: Read IT NOW!!

Ms Rowlg will have to start a new series  break her wd that there will only be 7 Harry Potter books!  I'm hooked!
Moved to London nearly a year ago  everyone here eher is readg  has read Harry Potter  Durg the daily commute  the Tube you can easily spot several adults readg one of the series  Just like many others I only picked up the first one out of curiosy  Once I picked up I couldn't put them downI echo many readers' comments on the style  fluy of the wrg  Thus I will not repeat them  What made me like the series is  brought back simple pleasure of pure imagation  Don't know about others but cynicism  harsh realy of adult le have stled my creativy  imagation over the years  The Potter wld is not easy eher  There are deces betrayal death  loneless  It's just as sophisticated like the real wld which adults can relate to  What's dferent is that there is black  whe right  wrong good  evil  It brgs everythg down to the basic  And of course all the magical creatures  sweets  toys just add that much me pleasure to be  thereOverall I am proud to say I am a Potter fan!

I have read all four Harry Potter books And I have to adm they are fun  entertag to read But what irks me is when people constantly refer to these as &quotthe best books ever&quot  &quotgreat lerature f children&quot Talkg to a friend (who also is a non-fanatical reader of Harry Potter) we both agreed on this sentiment Yet when confronted by such cricisms people blded by Harry Potter mania tend to scoff  say &quotWho cares? I read  f the entertament value&quot (People have said this to me befe!) Really? That's great So do I But then please shut up about how 's a masterpiece  the makg! Populary does not equal great leratureF one thg -  this is one of my biggest gripes - the characters are TOO one-dimensional Dumblede is way too perfect He is trustg believes  Harry when no one else will was the only one who Voldemt was afraid of blah blah blah Bg! Wh JK Rowlg's depiction of Dumblede as so fallible why not just change his name to Jesus  be done wh ? Pleasegive the guy some depth!And then there's Harry Po phaned Harry who just happens to be the youngest Seeker  a century! Not to mention he is put  the &quotbest Hogwarts house&quot which has won the Interhouse Cup whatever each year he's been a member (he helped break Slyther's wng streak!!!) Ugh The whole po phan (equipped wh a wicked &quotstep&quot family) who just so happens to be sanely talented (  many female sties beautul) style has been done to DEATH Cderella anyone?And the girls There is so much sexism  the books but 's maly ltle subtle thgsso I don't thk Rowlg put  there on purposebut please how come 's only the female characters who lose their heads  scream whenever a crisis dawns  the males are the only ones that keep their cool? Example: when Harry flies on his broom f the first time Ron gives an &quotadmirg whoop&quot  the girls just shriek  alarm Excuse me while I go pay homage to the pcela godsThe enemies are too one-dimensional also They are always beaten by the good guys they are never very smart they are shown only as evil evil not to mention strongly disliked  jealous fools I'm gog to repeat what I said f Dumblede: give the po people some depth!WellI know that my review bders maly on character development etc but that was my biggest gripe wh the books  therefe is my focus Now I just wa f the speful HP fans to start swoopg admirg whoop&quot  the girls just shriek  alarm Excuse me while I go pay homage to the pcela godsThe enemies are too one-dimensional also They are always beaten by the good guys they are never very smart they are shown only as evil evil not to mention strongly disliked  jealous fools I'm gog to repeat what I said f Dumblede: give the po people some depth!WellI know that my review bders maly on character development etc but that was my biggest gripe wh the books  therefe is my focus Now I just wa f the speful HP fans to start swoopg 
This is the best book I have read  ages!  I might be a ltle old (so some people say) to read the Harry Potter books but I just couldn't put  down  I bought the first book about a week befe I had bought all four  read them  Rowlg has created an astonishgly real le wld  the characters seem so real I got caught up  the whole sty  read  like  was real le  The fourth book is the best of the lot  that is sayg a lot  It is filled wh trigue  plots to resurrect &quotYou Know Who&quot  to kill our hero Harry Potter  An excellent book you won't be able to put  down  I just can't wa f the next stallment
After readg the first three I had to get my hs on this book This book has the same ol' Harry Potter highlights like suspense action  plot twists It has some great new characters that really grow on you Even though  is a great book  is the saddest book I have ever read I've read  six times  everytime I've cried at the end beacause  leaves you fellg empty side I cannot wa f the fth book to some out because this one leaves you on a maj clfhanger
Like all of the Harry Potter series this book is excellent If you liked the other three buy this one too! It is a wonderful book over all I don't thk  is the best book of the four however because  is a ltle too long I thk that as the Harry grows older  the books grow longer younger children could lose terest  the series F me (I'm 20) the books are a great escape from college studies but my 10 year old brother didn't fish I've noticed that some reviewers feel compelled to compare  to other (adult) fantasy novels like Tolkien's Rg series I would like to say to them that although millions of adults (like me) enjoy HP  is a children's book  is marketed that way If you want complex adult fiction don't read Harry Potter  then cricize  f beg the wrong genre! I would personally compare  wh Roald Dahl's wk--another children's fave!
Harry Potter is an experiance every kid should enjoy  An all out book f a kid's imagation  This book was a great way f me to stretch the lims of a magical wld  Harry potter is a perfect way f a kid to feel he  she can do somthg imptant Readg this book will help you learn the wld
What makes the fourth book of J K Rowlg's famous phan wizard so good to read is that  has plot twists fresh new characters (as always) wickedly funny  the length of  make  impossible to put down I won't reveal the plot to discourage spoilers but I will say one thg JKR keep on wrg Your loyal U S/Brish fans are wag f the fth book! :) (Too bad she doesn't answer her fan mail like a good auth should the reason why I deducted a star :( )Contas mature themes of death  tture not f wee children to read
I absolutely loved this book I have read all four books  now I'm a fanatic ( I'm 20)!!! The book just reaches   grabs a hold of ones ner child It puts you  a place that allows you to wer free I couldn't put this book down  I can't wa f book 5  the movie
The Harry Potter books have to be the best books I have ever read  They are captivatg  leave me countg down the months until the next book is released  You defly won't be disapoted!
I LOVE THIS BOOK AND THE OTHER SERIES!! I have all 4 books  I can not get enough of them! I can't wa until the movie comes out but especially the 5th book! In this bookHarry escapes from the Dursleys  watches a Quiddch game he dreams about his crush Cho Chang  he discovers about the mysterious events happeng at Hogwarts who volve two other rival schools of magic  a competion that hasn't happened f about a hundred years! He wants to be a nmal 14 year old wizard but however Harry isn't nmal BY wizardg stards   this case dferent can be deadly
In the fourth stallment of one of the most popular sereis of all time Harry Potter boy wizard has an adventure that will turn his le around A fourteen year old Harry looks fward to gog to the Quiddch Cup an allstar wizard quidddch game wh his best friends Ron  Hermione He wants to dream about his crush  be a nmail wizard Harry Potter isn't nmal he's dferent  dferent  his case can be deadlyMs Rowlg lives up to the success of her previous books takg a darker turn as the sereis progresses! Harry fans you won't be disappoted!!
I have read all four of JK Rowlgs Harry Potter books I have never enjoyed books me I read a lot  I enjoy readg juvenile books I fd them a better escape sometimes than the books f adults It is refreshg I loved her characters  I fd that they make me look foward to gog to the bookste  seeg  there is a new book outI am 20 yrs old  I am a very picky reader I only fish about 50% percent of the books I start but from the time I picked these books up I couldn't put them down f a second which has caused a lot sleepless nights  late bedtimes!!!!!!!
My mother asked me to read the first Harry Potter book as she was tryg to get my nephew to read   He is 9 years old  his mother thought the books were satanic  nature  I am 31 years old  I read the first three books  two days I couldn't put them down  There is nothg satanic about these books  they encourage the use of a child's imagation  I urge every parent out there that hasn't read the Harry Potter books to please read them  judge f yourself rather than listen to what other people thk about the books  They are really wonderful reads
Alright i've read all four of these books  theyre all cute  an extremely juvenile senseI prefer books that make you thk about them but you can guess your way through these books too easilyThe characters too are unchanggI fd Harry  Ron to be stereotypically mean  i do wish Rowlg would come up wh somethg new f Malfo  Dudley to do to HarryAnd i wish Hermione'd do somethg wrongI would say  your lookg f somethg truly complicated but  youve read all of the real classic Fantasies you should really try the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jdan
Let's just see  Like many Potter fans all over the wld I am  love wh fantasy  My terests are fantasy books anime  manga  I of course LOVE Harry Potter  a fanatical way  So that this doesn't turn to a profile of me -_- I'll start the review  Book IV didn't disappot me!  It was rivetg  I spent the whole day readg   This is Harry Potter's biggest adventure so far!  Read   I highly recommend Sabriel  Lirael by Garth Nix  the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman  Gbye!  ~Usagi-Bunny
First let me state: I am a firmly devoted Christian  I loved all 4 books  I have heard that  is &quotantichristian&quot  that  &quotteaches magic&quot  This is absurd!  Most books are wrten these days eher by nonchristians  people who feel that the particular sty does not focus on religious questions  Many people probably avoid the subject to avoid controversy  Personally I believe that many &quotChristian&quot fantasy books should be placed wh other fantasies  After all so far as I've seen just because the sty was set up around THE God stead of some make-believe god from the auth's own md doesn't affect the plot  Simply because she avoided the subject doesn't mean she's agast Next I must say I am 18 a Seni  I loved this book  I  felt myself identyg wh the characters sce I'd gone through that terrible age myself  The simplicy of the wrg  characterization does not take from the style  is actually a b of a relief after hours of Heart of Darkness  Canterbury Tales  I defely enjoyed havg somethg to read that remaed blunt clear  relaxgI must say though I feel somewhat gipped  Rowlg leaves us wh so many questions: What does Cho thk of Harry?  Does he st a chance?  What will become of Ron &amp Hermione?  Is there any way to stop Voldemt?  There was some small resolution to some of these problems but there isn't even a momentary eye contact to see to the character of Cho  We have so many unanswered questions  what does Rowlg do?  She takes a break!  She stops wrg!  The fth book won't be comg out f months  I'm left hangg!  JK Rowlg hurry please
JK Rowlg has cast another spell on her readers once aga wh her newest novel the Goblet of Fire  This fourth novel is the best by far  Readers will be lured to readg non stop once they start  their hearts will be charmed by Harry's lovg heart  his eagerness to help others when  a time of needThis novel picks up right where the third left off  When the novel begs Harry is about to start his fourth year at Hogwarts school of Wchcraft  Wizardry  Le couldn't be better f a fourteen year old not to mention his vatation to the Quiddch Wld Cup befe he starts another year of school  But thgs start to get a ltle crazy when the Death Eaters enter the picture  Not to mention all the pa his scar has been givg him  Could Ld Voldermont be back aga  ready f revenge?  Will Harry learn out the hard way  teach Ld Voldermont a lesson he will never fget?There are twice as many adventures wh Ron Herome  the Weasley family  Friendships become stronger  the bonds of friendship that Harry shares wh his friends will be tested  Not to mention the new friends that Harry makes throughout his fourth year to name a few Mad-Eye Moody one of Hogwart's newest teachers the beautul veelas Herome's new love trest  Ra Skeeter the nosey news repter from the Daily ProphetThere are twists  turns at every cner  The Quiddch matches are twice as excg the new characters are three times as delightful  This new novel is a defatley must read book  should be on the top of everyones readg list!
i am an adult  have read the hobb  ld of the rgs when i was a kid  i had heard how many kids who loved readg harry potter  some even havg nightmares from well i decided to try readg them  was surprised that jk rowlg really had surprise endgs that i could not have guessed at all -- love that type of twist of what you thk the endgs may be  never are they predictable  i thk this 4th one as well as the first one has been the best so far  lookg fward to the 5th to 7th books as well as the movie  read all four books  about a month  really had hard time puttg them down esp at the end of each book when everythg starts unfoldg  i nmally don't read much fiction as an adult  this is the only thg i've read  many years
JK Rowlg has cast another spell on her readers once aga wh her newest novel the Goblet of Fire  This fourth novel is the best by far  Readers will be lured to readg non stop once they start  This novel picks up right where the third left off  There are twice as many adventures wh the Weasley family old school friends  new ones too  There are twists  turns at every cner  The Quiddch matches are twice as excg the new characters are three times as delightful  This new novel is a defatley must read book  should be on the top of everyones readg list!
I am a Christian  have read all 4 Harry Potter books  I'm an adult but even as a child I understood make believe--which the kd of magic Harry  his friends do is like  I like the good mals  example that Harry is to kids  He has special skills but values his friends is still a kid strugglg  some areas  successful  others  he saves friends  enemies from evil fces
I won't make an apology of the book thouss others have already done that better than I could haveI'll just say that this masterpiece just won the 2001 Hugo award which is the most prestigious among science-fiction  fantasy lerature JK Rowlg just joed the ranks of a very narrow group of mythical wrers (Asimov Hele Clarke Dick Le Gu)
I bought the first  this series of books f my 10 year old grdaughter while the books seem to be a b above her at this pot I have gone on to buy all four books  have throughly enjoyed them all! My 17 year old son  several of his friends have read all of the books  the series as well  that says a LOT f the books as my son hates to read I hear the next book won't come out until next summer &ltgulp&gt That is a l-o-n-g time to wa!
Absolutley amazg! I can honestly tell you at first I was hesant to read Harry Potter because I'm not to fantasy books however I did  I was not disappoted The Goblet of Fire has humoursuspense  every other grediant to make an excellent book I personally love the characeter Ron he's just so sarcastic I'm wag very impatiently f 5th book(Htht)
Well this is fantastic The whole series by self is wonderful but Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far THE bestI won't tell you much of what happens except f the fact that Harry is accidently put to the Triwizard Tournament He has to battle a dragon rescue Ron from the bottom of the lake  outsmart a maze  der to even be close to wng the Triwizard CupA special note: PLEASE please heed my advice keep a box of kleenex wh you when you get down to the fal 5 chapters I won't tell you what happens save to say that there is a 95% chance you WILL need them
This is the best Harry Potter book by far Its the most excg  fearful! As an adult reader I liked the fact that  was deeper  darker than the other 3 Harry Potter books It combed the mystery  trigue wh comedy as Harry begs to grow up  takes an terest  girlsAn excellent book f people of all ages I recommend  to anyone - even those who don't like fantasy booksJust can't wa til the film now!!
I have read the first four volumes  the series i am 62 so not still a child  i enjoyed VOL 4 as the best  the series so far although VOL 1 is a not too distant second  I was completely enthrawled  couldn't put the book down I wanted me every after 750 pages
My 13 year old told me to say &quotEnough wh Harry Potter&quot I thk the auth is losg the gemeration of kids who started wh her as they get older He has discovered other series tat he much prefers such as the Brian Jacques REDWALL series  the DRAGONS OF PERN series As your kids mature they will outgrow Harry Too bad Harry isn't keepg up Personally I found this book disappotg The auth is copyg from others  pawng  off as her own No really igal ideas just hype And this one is just a tad b cynical  dark Oh well you can't hype stuff  expect  to last I gave this 2 stars f the attempt  some fast movg passages otherwise there is a lot better out there f your kids
ATTENTION PARENTS: If your child is spendg tp much time at the TV grab this book turn off the TV s your child down h them a Harry Potter book I swear on all that is holy that these books are the Saviour of ltle children wh TV-fried bras!! I'd start wh the first 3 of course  then wk yourself up to the best one of the four wrten by the talented JK Rowlg The fourth book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is as enjoyable as the last 3 The characters grow the plot creases   will make your child wa  anticipation f the next book (which is comg  2002) I know I am
Harry Potter is the best series I have EVER read! No matter where you are  the book you always have your face   You can't stop LITERALLY! I remember readg the books at 1:00am  thkg 'I have school tommrow I have to sleep   ok just one me chapter' And then I'd keep dog that until I fell alseep readgHarry Potter is a wonderful series f all ages! YES EVEN ADULTS! I know so many adults who read Harry Potter Don't be ashamed of  they're great books  they help you cope wh the stress of the wld You go to a wld where fantasy comes true  the wld you dreamed of as a child is real!!!
I especially like this book because as Harry matures so does the sty evolvg around himWhere have you been livg  a cave? You must have this book And  you want this book then you MUST get the previous 3 because  you read this one first you won't get lost but you won't get the full impact of this book!
In sht most of the Harry Potter books have been wonderful  number 4 is no exception Rowlg leaves such a spellbdg fish 's hard to wa patiently f number 5!
This is one of the best books I have ever read Suspenseful at ALL times good f ANY age!
I'm 13  wiccan I read this book  less than 2 days because  was so trillg It really makes me upset when christian parents fbid their children to read this series of Harry Potter books because they are absolutly harmless  personally I have achually "enjoyed readg" these books Wh almost all the books I've read i just lose terest but wh this series i couldn't put the books down They are wonderful  absolutly NOT Satanic In general wchcraft isn't satanic But I won't get to that arguement Over all this was the best book series I've ever read
The 4th Harry Potter book is a spectacular book Filled wh fantsy adventure  magic the Harry Potter books keep on gettg better  better The 4th novel is great wh the stange event takg place at Hogwarts Two other schools come to Hogwarts  all three compete  the event Wh friendship  adventure the fth book is the best yet The 5th will surely be great  probaly better Go out  get Harry Potter  the Gobelt of Fire You will love  I am sure

JK Rowlg has done  aga! Not only has she bewched the wld but she has fmed a facatg dream f all children to share Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is an amazg styIt really got me trested  I hope she keeps wrttg
Never md 700 pages you will not notice  because  is very enjoyable readg This book takes somewhat dferent direction then the other three There is new kd of competion new characters someone imptant dies someone will ga power somethg is happeng between Ron  Hermoe I could not put  down If you like Harry Potter you will f sure like this one And  you are &quotreader from PA&quot maybe you should just pass on wrg reveiws I couldn't believe there is still that kd of prejudice exists!
Any book that can capture the attention of millions of children (not to mention adults) f 700+ pages has to be remarkable Given how good the first three Harry Potter novels were 's amazg that this one is even better All of you're fave thgs from the earlier novels are here - wonderful magical creatures a suspenseful  compellg plot excg Quidtdch games omous threats  heroic bravery Nevertheless Rowlg's wrg skills have clearly matured Her unparalleled imagation is still at wk but she has added subtle nuances that make her characters even me terestg I am most impressed by how she has Harry  his friends agg appropriately whout losg their appeal to a younger audience All the lerary praise aside this is a great read Hurry up wh Book 5!
Christian opponents wried parents  paranoid cult haters have all found reason to hate this series I have a brief statement to make I am a Christian  a parent of two young children I believe that this book only impacts young people negatively  the parents do not communicate wh their children about what is fiction  what is not I read the newspaper daily  I don't believe  murder If these books draw even one child to the glious wld of readg then Ms Rowlg has done great thgs f society!!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is my fave book  the Harry Potter series so far It is a masterpiece It is the begng of what promises to be an epic engagement between the powers of Good  EvilA lot of people (too many of which have not actually read these books) fd the Potter books objectionable I have to seriously agree that less mature children should not read &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot until they can hle some of s darker aspects Still I fd  no me objectionable than other great children's books such as &quotThe Lion the Wch  the Wardrobe&quot  &quotThe Ld of the Rgs&quotI praise JK Rowlg f not glamizg evil As Ld Voldemt gets stronger  book four we get to see him f what he isthe personication of evil wh nothg admirable about himThere are some great new characters  book four My faves are Ludo Bagman  Vikt Krum (you have to love how he say Herm-o-ny)I have also really come to like Cedric Diggy (who is mentioned briefly  book three) Cedric remds me a lot of CS Lewis's High Kg Peter--the very picture of true chivalryAs always another book makes me like Harry Hermione  Ron (all the Weasleys really--especially &quotWeatherby&quot) me than I did  the book befe Though human  flawed they are great as unlikely heroesI give &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot my highest recommendation
The fact that there are nearly 4000 reviews wrten already f this book says  all I have just fished readg the fourth Harry Potter novel &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot I can't recall beg me impressed befe Havg wrten three amazg books already JK Rowlg has done  aga  pulled out another wner from the Stg Hat It is my personal opion that the Harry Potter series outdoes many folkle auths In fact Rowlg's books are arguably only surpassed by JRR Tolkien  their overwhelmg grip on the reader - f once the sayg &quothe couldn't put  down&quot was true f me Havg now read all four books  eagerly awag number 5 I am about to start from book one aga! Please don't thk these books are just f kids The plot character development  phenomenal imagation that comes from these books is well the buy  exceeds that of many modern auths Fally please note the warng that some reveiws contaed here give away the surprises  the sty
I would have to agree that this stallment is much &quotdarker&quot than s predecesss  f that reason should probably not be read by younger children (who might darily be readg volumes 1-3)who might be squeamish Nonetheless I found this book to be delightful Rowlg has moved character development along very well (how refreshg to see Harry's friends fally get fed up wh his neverendg &quotfame&quot) has left many avenues open f years 5-7 (did anyone else start wonderg whether Dumblede is everthg he says he is?) I did fd the death of one character a b gratuous (he wasn't despe all repts to the contrary that big of a character to beg wh)  the resurrection of Voldemt a b too graphic f young children (heck f me even) but despe that this book had me wishg f the next stallment (this from a person who read the first book only to prove that the &quothype&quot was ridiculous  that these sties probably really were hrible)I have to wonder though  this series can really susta self through seven years of Hogwarts (especially  we can't expect volume 5 f over a year) Harry's teen years Probably though Rowlg can hle  Oh  f the sanctimonius  who condemn these tales whout readg them first  who cry out f banishment (ever hear of a ltle sty called &quotFarenhe 451&quot?)  book burngs eher get over yourselves  jo the amish communy This book certaly does NOT promote evil (what do you thk that  's read backwards a secret message will appear?) In fact the students at Hogwarts are punished f usg their magic f anythg other than good  f cryg out loud these books make no reference to devil wshippg voodoo  anythg of the st So I would suggest that you speak of thgs you know about  leave the conjecture to the students of Hogwarts
The Goblet of Fire is one of the best books  the series wh a wonderful plot that makes you thouroughly absbed  the text  I hope she contues to wre me about Harry after his 7 years of Hogwarts
I absolutely love all of the Harry Potter books!!!  It's defetly a wonderful read not only the first time but this is a book you can enjoy over  over!
This 4th volume  the Harry Potter series &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot mers the 5-star ratg f what I term &quotlerary richness&quot  Rowlg weaves a thread of many strs to give the reader a 700+ page mega-novel that is so excg that  reads wh the fast pace of a 200 page novel And  you STILL want me!F those like me who enjoy a b of the gothic wh well-stated details set  a milieu of on-the-edge-of-your-seat excment then this is a book of fantastic scope! Extradarily excg!
This book has a really surprise endg You should buy this book It is really fascatg  you like wchcraft
I have been a Harry potter fan sce i picked up the first book In fact i love this book so much that i fought wh my mother over who gets to read the books first That is how good they are But this book however is by far the best It is full of alot of twist  turns You will laugh at the weasleys the tws fred  gege  their bags of tricks Mr weasley  his facation wh plugs ron  hermoe's bickerg  you will fally get to meet the other weasley brothers as well as many other characters such as mad eye monney You will aslo see that the characters develop me fully  this sty than  the others You will see how harry tackles his promblems You'll get so nervous  exced  parts of the book that you will not be able to put  down There however are emotional parts  this book to that you may shed a tear over But all  all this is one of the best books  the series as of yet People thk that harry potter is only f children but you will discover when you read these books especially this one that these books are f kids from ne years old to hundred  one Considereg that I am  college  love this book you will to You won't be sry that you bought !
The books never even mention the guy! Those children the reader cluded  the review were clearly havg confused terpertations of Harry Potter as was the reader I hope that the reader comes back  sees that the review was not helpful to several people--people who actually read the book  understood what  really was Also JK Rowlg said no such thg Whatever you read  was a fat lie If you need anyme proof I suggest you actually read the books  see that  is simply fiction  people who misterpret  f somethg real obviously have a big problem Once aga there is no such mentiong of Satan  Jesus beg weak  anythg along those les  the books Even me the students of Hogwarts celebrate Christmas! I seriously hope that the Christians agast Harry Potter will wake up from their own spell of ignance  paranoia  realize that Harry Potter is nothg me than a series of books that are popular as other series have been  are I suggest that all of you stop burng the books  start dog somethg actually useful To all the other readers I suggest you stop readg any of the hrible reviews attackg Harry Potter because the reviewers don't know anythg about the books
This book as everythg a book should have Action Suspence Romance  hr Harry Potter has opened up many eyes f adults  kids  the sties open up ones imagation
This book  series is delightful  I have read all 4 books  listened to all 4 wh my 5 &amp 8 yr olds on CD  We will read  listen to them  enjoy them f years to comeNo where  any of the books have I read one wd about religion  spirualy of ANY st  I refuse to buy to unsubstantiated implied scare tactics of &quotreader from PA's&quot review - Harry Potter books somehow turng &quot20 MILLION&quot young people to Satanism????  This st of sensationalism is a discred to ChristianyThe beauty of this series is that Harry's wld is close enough to ours to be familiar  comftable yet delightfully magical keepg us amazed  Plus Harry et al gets to deal wh frighteng suations  do  well  What kid doesn't feel me capable  only f a while when lettg themselves be Harry f a chapter  two?Doffg my Gryffd hat to JK Rowlg
Okay you're probably all wonderg why I am wrg a review of a book that came out a year ago  the answer is I've been at school an extra year  have me juicy adjectives  wrg knowledge at my disposal Harry Potter is like the Star Wars fims  book fm The styles are totally dferent you will fd no wookiees  lightsabres  this book n will you fd magic ws  massive wizardy schools  any of the Star Wars films but they are both phenomenons Like Gege lucas JK Rowlg has managed to draw you  wh her knowg what we (Ie you) want Each book  the series has a totally dferent plotle but wh the characters you know  love People don't realise how similiar these two phenomenons are but when you start wonderg whether Ld Voldemt is Harry's father you can't help noticg a similary Everyone should know the plot by now so I won't expla who Voldemt is The whole series is filled wh enough twists  turns you could make a roller coaster out of  Irresistable irreplacable  errr unputdownable
I got the book at like eight o'clock  the mng  didn't take my eyes off  until two  the mng I ended up sprag my thumb from holdg the thg but  was wth  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book  the Harry Potter series thusfar
I really enjoyed the the 1st 2nd  3rd of the Harry Potter books I thk 's st-of long  the fact that Harry Potter is special is st-of gettg old I thk 's too much  one small book I mean 700 pages! The fact that crushes are troduced is st of well you know what I mean That's what I thk
I thaught The Goblet Of Fire was the best out of the four books I didnt see anythg wrong wh I thaught the book was wrten well  had a clear styleAlthough  took a long time to get to the part where harry gets to hogwartsYou need to read  all to underst the styleSomeone does die  the book who is well knownDont read the last three chapters of the book because  spoils the whole plotIn the last somebody very well known might die as well
This fourth volume makes you hope there will be many me By far so far the best  the thickest The book is packed wh events  a tremendous level of creativy  imagation At the same time the references to the previous volumes are still numerous givg to this new episode a perfect contuy  the styThe first element that jumps out is the fact that Harry Potter has been growg  age from one volume to the next   this volume he really has his age thirteen This is the mark of a very good wrer who is able to follow the matury  the maturation of the characters so that the sty is realistic Never  the four volumes  particularly  this volume are the characters older than they should be Hermione discovers social consciousness  gets terested  the fate of elves as well as she discovers the dference between friendship  love Ron Weasley discovers the need to believe his friends  the first pangs of love  sexual awareness Harry Potter opens his eyes to the necessy to assume his responsibilies by learng what he needs to accomplish his tasks  the sense of hon  human solidary even wh a competion  which he tries  he is not the only one to rema human wh his challengers  co-compets stead of beg an unsensive  selfish wng mache This is done wh great subtlety  delicacy Fred  Gege Weasley are older  they discover the need to have a social  economic posion  society that brgs  an come based on a creative project f the whole communy : this is known as busess  any societyThe second element is that the confrontation between Potter  Voldemt fally comes to a direct face-to-face one-on-one duel whose stake is le  death f Harry Potter as well as le  death f his direct friends  the whole communy The battle leaves the level of dividuals to reach the level of society a real universal value a cosmological dimension And  this progressively built up  non-fal because undecisive as f the le of death of Voldemt himself frontal shock the wrer shows a level of imagation that has no lims She uses older elements  an unfeseen  at least partially unpredictable way  she adds new elements that are totally undeductable from the previous volumes Suspense is absolute  never at this level loosened  weakenedThe third element is The wideng of the national  ethnic scope of the book The auth troduces a competion that brgs to the picture two schools from abroad : one from France  another one from eastern  central Europe Hence there is a play on the particular « dialects » of those feigners  their use of English a play on food variations on clothg variations on transptation variations etc This is supposed to widen the scope of the students&#8217 consciousness  awareness of the dferences that exist between  among humans to brg out a wider acceptg of national  ternational cooperation But she also widens the scope by troducg several other communies particularly  some that are tradionally rejected by wizards  wches on the basis  pure prejudice that is to say racism : merpeople elves gobls (a ltle) giants (only a begng) The aim is always to show that cooperation between dferent ethnic groups is necessary to give the future some stabily  predictabilyThe fourth element has to do wh polical power  s abuses Power f the sake of power (Ld Voldemt)  f the sake of stabily (The Mister of Magic Fudge)  f the sake of lawfulness (that always covers some unlawful element  some human attudes to impose the law)  f the sake of personal privileges (like the power to show off to get publicy to bet  gamble) leads to abuse  cecy at least shtsightedness the capabily to see how the future

This is a revised version of my other review  As I have previously said this is the greatest book ever  Because of the Tri - Wizard tournament there is no Quiddch at the school  In October the two other magic schools Beaxbutons  Durmstrang come to Hogwarts to participate  this event  You have to be at least 17 to be able to enter but someone enters Harry's name I won't tell you who though  In this book Harry fds a crush Cho Chang  so does Hagrid  Madam Maxime  Harry meets Voldemt aga  fds out a few secrets from him  Dumblede  The reason f this books length is because of the Quiddch wld cup that the Weasley's Harry  Hermione go to  the begng  Not until page 150 do they go to Hogwarts  They also spend a lot of tome dog the tasks f the tri-wizard tournament  In the last task Harry spends que a b of time wh Voldemt  They also spend que a b of time fdg out secrets  So remember buy this book!
Oh my gosh this is a great book! In the past week I have read  twice Isn't that a recd  what! Harry Potter  the goblet of fire is a great book f all of you who belive that anythg is possible want an adventure sty   your'e just lookg f a good read! I recommend  f all ages but  even gave my mom a spook!And when i ask people what they're fave book is from every cner of the neighbhood I hear Harry Potter year four
This book has raked up much praise  adation from the young readg public The excg sty les  exotic characters revolvg around a magical settg is what brgs  the young readers However the complex relationships that Harry entertas wh his friends family ments  enemies are what keeps the mature readers of Harry Potter This book is seemgly the begng of what seems to be the &quotmaturg process&quot of a young boy we have all come to ade This stage  young Harry Potter's le arouses a b of nervous feelgs f the adult readers because new problems  suations are bound to be troduced to the seemgly very young readers Perhaps this &quotmaturg process&quot will rake  a whole new audience of readers  loose the large fans Harry Potter has already gatheredPersonally I can't wa to see how JK Rowlgs pulls this off The ragg hmones  erratic teenage behavi ought to be a signicant twist to the already novative plot!This book is the begng of a new stage of Harry Potter  marks a long period of wag to see what will happen next
I loved the Harry Potter books:all of them But I really liked this oneThis is a great book f kids as well as adults I can't wiat until the fth one comes out!
I loved this book as everyone did  I can't wa f the movie!
This was my very first troduction to the Harry Potter series   was truly a magical experience  Harry Potter reflected the kd of nocence that one would fd  a child not yet come  to his own a Nerd of sts whose potentials  possibilies appear hopelessly lost  his abily to &quotf &quot Harry is not ially thought of as &quotHero&quot material wh all the goodness stregnth  self-righteousness emmatg from him  Unwtgly  unwillgly he is thrust to circumstances by which heroes  victims are created Wh unerrg tuion he comes to his ownas a reluctant hero humbled by the price paid by his survival  Harry Potter exists!

I was so exced when the 4th book came out There was a party at Bders bookste on my 16th birthday  i was so stoked to fally get this book JK Rowlgs  Harry Potter never disappot me The book was so well wrten  me thrillg then the ones befe  I cannot wa f the 5th
Harry Potter fans will fd that this novel is the best  the series so far  Breakg the rules  showg evolution this novel illustrates how well rounded a wrer Rowlg has becomeFirst this novel a behemoth wh roughly 700 odd pages breaks the stard Harry Potter rubric  It begs wh a turn f the better  Our first glimpse to Harry's 4th year is a feshadowg of Voldemt (er you-know-who)  All I can say is that I am extremely pleased that the Dursley's weren't my first impression aga  Speakg of which when they did show up Rowlg fally makes them stomachable aga by havg the Weasley tws play some nasty tricks on them  Good show!Second this stallment of the Harry Potter series shows that Harry is begg to mature  Where the other novels have a rather schoolboyish attude surroundg Potter this one shows slight signs of his matury  The subtelty of these ideas  the wrg shows how truly skilled a wrer Rowlg has becomeLast the end of the book is unlike the others a clfhanger  Harry's sty is now locked   has me ( I'm guessg thouss of others) hooked  wag f the 5th stallmentExcellent wrg!
When I read the book  took me three weeks to fish ! Like the other Harry potter books only took me two days to fish Rowlg really tests your readg wh imagation  that is really imptant f a lot of younger girls  boys I loved the book As alawys she really is a good wrer I eagerly anticipate on readg her next book Harry Potter  the der of the phoneix! I can't wa And I hope to see the movie too this fall
Actually this is one of my fave books!  Don't be scared off by the length of this one 's all f the better ( don't rush this book  you'll miss thgs!)  This book went to such detail (not potless detail) I feel like I know Harry a lot better now  The plot was EXCELLENT  suspenseful I can't wa until they turn this one to a movie hehe  I must say that ltle kids might not enjoy this one as much as teenagers probably because this book deals wh me sister elements than the previous three (death betrayal violence etc)  My 10 year old sister read this book  she didn't like  as much as I did  She still liked  ofcourse but I LOVED !  Can't wa f #5!
I'm gog to keep this sht  There is somethg about the Harry Potter books that is outstg creative telligent beautul  perfect  Not everyone sees   this is not a cricism but  is too bad  I do feel sry f them  Some of you who are readg this review will thk  is stupid  arrogant but some will read   know exactly what I'm talkg about  To those readers I would like to give you some advice  Don't try to pass by Harry Potter  fget   even "get over "  Learn from  because there is me knowledge  those books than anythg else I've ever encountered
I am one of those adults who loves Harry Potter I am 46 yet I fd these &quotyoung adult&quot sties me igal excg  better wrten than 99% of what is published under the &quotfantasy&quot genreIf I have to name one fault of this series  would be that the character's are to pure  The don't fart they have no sexual desires (only romantic ones) they don't cuss ect   this way the sties are remd me of ones from the turn of the century yet that might be part of the appeal
I am a die hard Harry Potter fan  this is the best book yet  I like the ltle dark twist at the end  I can't wa f the fth book to come out to fd out what happens!  Anybody who hasn't read any Harry Potter books needs to start soon!
This book is really good because  is dferent from all the others  the Harry Potter series F one thg  doesn't have Quddch at Hogwarts The only Quiddch takes place at the Quiddch Wld Cup  the begng Although I love the Quiddch  the book at least there is a b of  Also the endg is not exactly joyous as  the other books( of course I will not spoil  by tellg you) I can ensure you that each page is FILLED wh excement  that you will not be able to put the book down once you start
Harry's fourth year - though he doesn't know  yet - will be far me terestg than the first three  far me dangerous The book starts off wh him beg woken from a nightmare by his scar hurtg When he returns to school everythg seems almost as nmal as usual -  as possible at Hogwarts - apart from people whisperg about the Dark Mark at the Quiddch Wld Cup Hogwarts' Quiddch beg cancelled f the Triwizard Tournament  him (unwtgly) beg entered to  Harry (who has to deal wh fame on a new level) Ron (who learns to control the green-eyed monster)  Hermione (who'll dabble  polics) struggle to keep their heads above water  on their necks as friendships strengthen  new ones bloom Many dangers lie ahead  twists gale unfold Clearly Rowlg is able to susta ( even add to) her flare comedy  suspense as another year begs at Hogwarts
This book  the best so far of Rowlg's series  We are troduced to new characters  see our old ones grow  I'm very uneasy about this book beg read to young children  There is a very heartwrenchg scene  the book that turns away from her tradional style of wrg  I actually felt my throat become scratchy  my eyes water  But you will defately enjoy this one  It doesn't end like the others eher  You don't feel like everythg will be okay  You are left to wonder how she will beg the next sty  how will everythg turn up It's excg
Harry  my opion is proud  refuses to accept other peoples help  serta suations  F example befe the 2nd task he spent hours tryg to fd out about the gillyweed  couldn't do  He used Hermione  Ron to help him but never even thought about Neville Longbottom who he dismissed as useless As Bartemius Crouch Jnr said towards the end "Harry Potter you have a streak of pride  dependence that might have rued all"
As I have previously said this is far the greatest book out of the four the greatest book over all the books that I have read I haven't read this book  a while so some thgs might be wrong  First there is no quidch  the book because they are havg all the people  from all the  other schools come  compete  these games  I thk only seventh  eighth years can compete but someone mysteriously stuck harry's name  there  sce the goblet picked his name he was representg Hogwarts  this other kid that he doesn't like There are four tasks to do until they w {but I fgot what they w} the last one is a race   That's all I remember so bye
It was nice to see that book four was 734 pages long knowg  was the last book befe the 'dry spell' while wag f Hogwarts year 5 to be released  2002 This book is very juicy  styles The book starts out wh some very strange happengs at the Quddch Wld cup when the Dark Mark is seen( I won't tell you what the dark mark is  I ru the suspense!) As most people know there will be no Quiddch this year at Hogwts but to make that up they will have the Triwizard Tournement They haven't had this event  hundreds of years due to the amount of juries  deaths to the participants The suspense contues when Harry somehow gets to the tournament even though he is underageIn this book JK also troduced a new character know as Mad-Eye Moody who is the new defense agast dark arts teacher who seems to have que a likg  terest  Harry As the Triwizard Tournament progress the styles defelty get much me juicier As the fal event approaches  looks like all the contestants from the three schools are  contention However the best part of this book isn't until the very very end as there will be a big surprise!!! I don't want to spoil anyme of the book so you will have to read the book! All I can say is after readg the endg of book 4 I can't wa f the return of the Harry Potter books  2002!!!!
This book (as well as the previous  the series) is already available  Italian But whenever possible I prefer igal versions  this is the reason why I read HP  English In general I enjoyed this book As usual  is so full of ventiveness  turns of events that one becomes sry when the last page is reached  I really appreciated the imperceptible changes  the characters' nature the transion from childhood to adolescence But I fear that the auth could become me  me &quotprof-driven&quot  subjugate her pen to the reasons of mass market I have had this feelg here  there I really hope to be wrong!
While still matag the igaly  entertament of the first 2 books Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire loses pots because  doesn&#8217t have the mere spir of the first 3 It feels like a whole new Harry  all dferent characters we are strayed away from the descriptive sarcastic smart  funny characters we loved  the first 3 books This is  a way very telligent but somehow disappotg The 4th Harry outg is still highly recommendable The sty is shockg  has grown up a lot this book I would most recommend to teens Not f the violence  the sense of romance but me plot-wise The teenagers will take this  better the kids may have to have  terpreted by an adult The book maly consists of Harry preparg  dog tasks f a big competion  I found the preparation f the tasks the best b of the book It brgs out an telligence  the series that no other book has displayed while the actual dog of the tasks themselves are great You feel like you are there feelg the fire on your neck  been caught up  a web of rush  tension In the end all  all Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire succeeds  beg a pleasurable  trigug book f most audiences but f some  will be a let-down
It is an excellent childrens book that teaches virtues le  what beg brave is about First I looked at these books I thought they were a mdless fad but when I got around to readg them they were wonderful This book is the best one so far because we can see the characts growg up We see me hidden emotions such as jealousy  lust  Some may say the book is violent but I have another thought The book is a fantasy book that needs to clg on to realy   realy there's violence To learn virtues about honesty courage  loyalty you must also learn that there's violence  the wld  To the parents who are confused about the lack of metaphs  sophisticated language you have to remember that the characts  this book are preteens  preteens have ltle appreciation f such kd of wds  In conclusion 's a great book  deserves to be read by all fantasy fans (fantasy fans I like the sound o that)
I have just fished readg this book   is whout a doubt my fave of the four I have read the first three  I loved them JK Rowlg does a great job of makg you feel what Harry feels If he gets scared happy  nervous you feel just what he feels  that's one of the thgs I enjoy about these booksIn this book I  really enjoyed the events gog on durg the Tri-Wizard Tournament There is defely a lot of excement  this bookIf you haven't read any of the Harry Potter series you have to read the first one to see  you like  Or  you have read the first three you must buy the fourth you will love PS When's the fth book gog to be released?
Only two weeks ago did I get the four Harry Potter books  Although I had heard that adults (such as myself :) enjoy them as much as the younger set I just hadn't had the desire to read them  Well    now I wish I hadn't waed so long!  I read the first three  2 1/2 days the fourth one (this book which I am reviewg) took a b longer of course :)  It was wonderful I am happy that the size was much larger so that I could learn even me about all the characters  their lives  The endg defely has me wag impatiently f the next stallments
While the styles of the first three parts of the Harry Potter series are basically the same Joanna Rowlg takes  one stap further  part four Not the quiddch tournament but a magic contest between three (ternational) wizard schools is the red le  the sty She also pays less attention to the obnoxious Dursley family  me to VoldemtThe Goblet of Fire is by far the most thrillg of the four parts Harry is growg up  his opponents are me fmiddable This book seems to be directed to a me mature audience Can't wa f part five!
Not sce Tolke has the lerary wd seen anythg that resembles Harry Potter Whilst on holiday  the south of France I happened to meet one of the seni executives of Bloomsbury (the igal imprt f the Harry Potter series) Havg heard the tales of bookshops swamped wh exced buyers I couldn't resist askg him whether  was down to good marketg  good wrg He assured me  was good wrg I believed him  bought all four booksThanks David f your sound advice JKRowlg has deed wrten a series that is brilliantly simple  s conception yet amazgly telligent  s ptrayal If you've never read them you should Wh half a dozen pages you'll fd nothg at all unusual about students of Hogwart's School of Wchcraft  Wizardry ridg high on broomsticks playg a game called QiddchHarry Potter is now aded wldwide So is his creat Joanne Kathleen (JK) Rowlg a sgle mother wh a wonderful imagation  a gt of sight to the mds of youngsters  adults alike She has the undeniable abily to recall her own childhood  capture those wonderful though sometimes dficult times It's an abily that makes her creation Harry Potter so easily acceptableI notice that the Goblet of Fire states 'Readg Level Ages 9-12' Clearly a misprt It should be 'Readg Level Ages 9-92' Eighty years from now Harry Potter books will be sold as collects ems  boxed sets  todays 12 year olds will still be readg them  relivg their childhoodsIf you still haven't read any of the Harry Potter collection you should swallow your pride  do so now! (They prt adult edions wh less strikg front covers!)
The good thgs first The growg up of the characters is beautully ptrayed The sensivy of early teenage relationship among friends  the sudden realisation of the characters about their  their friends' gender is very well crafted The style holds tight despe s length  Now the not so good thgs It is the most sensational of all the Potter books  I'm afraid  has played to the market fces Most of the aspects appear to be domated by the sellg fact overhypg the characters  the suations The first three books were wren me from the heart  self belief this was wrten f the market wh the aim of hard sellg  md fcefully ltg everythg to a grer scale As a result the book loses the nocence present  the earlier volumes Overall 's a book that lives upto the series wh s share of new ideas  imagation makg  a compellg read but  achieves this goal maly because of the earlier volumes It keeps up the terest f the next  the series (no5) but wh trepidation that playg to the market fces  fallg to the trap of followg a sellg fmulae of a sensational bestseller will spoil the charm of the series The auth should show the courage to wre a shter book f the next one  the series  necessary fillg unnecessary pages doesn't add anythg to the creativy
i have found this series amousg  entertag but  could be wrten better i like the idea of a school f learng magic but  often drags on  slow spots the set up  the begg of the sty often takes up to 70 pages why doesnt she expla  when the need arises throughout so a reader isn't tempted to give up on the book  the openg chapters? there are better books out there
I don't get why some people say this book is bad f kids I thk this is a perfectly great book It really lived up to all the hype wh the great Triwizard Tournament! I can't wa f the next one to come because now Voldemart is back!
I'm 15  can honestly say that I've never been a fan of fantasy sties  I started readig Harry Potter out of bedom I was  f a surprise! From the first page of the first book to the last page of the 4th book I was totally captured by the magic of Harry Potter I thk this 4th book was so good  the endg was surprisg to me    has left me wonderg The characters  this book are so well developed  the plot is wonderful Some parts of the book are totally hilarious while others are kd of scary This mix makes one GREAT book  I recommend  to everyone!
I have given this book one star f just one reason: There isn't a zero star option! I am stunned by the rave reviews this book receives I have read all four of the books  this miserable series  have wrten a review on the first book (my opion hasn't changed- that review is also a one-star) I'm not planng on spendg money on these books anyme In my experience many of the people who love Harry Potter are the ones who will read a book only  they have a book rept  summer readg to do These books are f the people whose imagations are impoverished due to lack of readg As another reviewer put  &quotThe adults who like these books are the ones who didn't pay attention  English class&quot One other thg I've noticed is that this series should have a subtle: The Ld Of the Rgs This book lacks igaly JK Rowlg has tried  failed to wre a book as great as The Ld of the Rgs by JRR Tolkien When Harry Potter #5 arrives on the shelves leave  alone  pick this one up You won't regret ! Another series of much higher qualy are the Redwall Series by Brian Jacques Then when you've fished wh them read the Sherlock Holmes sties by A Conan Doyle Another series to read as soon as possible are The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis So fget Harry Potter  read good books like these!
Ah the wld of Harry Potter As usual the wonderful wrgs of Ms J K Rowlg held me under a spell  I just couldn't put  down I love the whole wld that she's created  because I'm an excellent reader f my age I could hle the 4th book My Mum  my Uncle have both read all the books  i agree wh them that the books have become me dficult as the sty countiues But   all  still remas  excellent novel wh a thrillg plot twist There is so much mystery  trege the whole plot is filled wh lies hate  a great many stunng surprisesOne thg that I must give to Ms Rowlg above al others is her abily to keep thgs straight Despe the fact that she discovered a large whole  the plot  had to wk 12 hour days f 2 weeks  der to fnish the book JK's good wrg skills ( I'm asummg good notes) kept every last detail straightbut I did notice one flaw The end of the novel when Voldemt  Harry duel The people  spells that came out of the Dark Ld's w were supposed to come from the latest one  back Well first there was Wmtail's h followed by Cedric Diggy The old Gardener Bertha Jks  then here I thk is a mistake First Harry's father came out of the w then Lily Potter Am I mistaken but didn't Lily Potter die after James? So truthfully  should have been Lily  then James Right? JK's simple  one time mistake perhaps were not noticed by many but I remember that at least Well I'll excuse the flaw I Loved the book despe this
the day that this book came out this book had high expectations from just about everyone  i hafta agree that  meets them  then some  my opion 's the best book of the series as of yet this book cpates many past details from prequels (such as harry potter  the prisoner of azkaban)jk rowlg is one of my fave fictional auths because of this  although because of that fact 's hard f readers to start from the middle of the series  also makes  me excg f dedicated readers another admirable qualy of this series is that adults can  do become caught up  the magical l as well as children this book is obviously about our fave kid wizard harry potter  a contest called the triwizard tournament this tournament is completely  totally dangerous causg the allure of  to crease here we also fd that hogwarts is not alone  the wld of magic as a school f young enterprisg wizards  wches the catch is that hogwarts competes agast the two other schools  europe  this sty beauxbaton is a snotty french school that consider beauty above all the best qualy  the wld (showg  the students teachers  school self) durmstrang is the secretive school that has turned out the most dark wizards  histy  the goblet of fire is the impartial judge to choose the champions f the schools our old friend cedric diggy is the hogwarts champion &quotsurprisgly&quot harry is chosen by the goblet of fire as the fourth contestant  the tournament breakg rules here  there the animosy toward him from just about the entire school is tangible i'm sure that you can tell trouble is on the way the evil voldemt gets mixed up  the whole predicament  me but i'm not gog to break out any me juicy details you'll just hafta found out yourself the only cricism that i can offer is that though the book is extensive  doesn't offer as much magical description  wonder as befe  the first books but what else is there can a person thk of that wasn't befe? a defe  must read  you like this serieson  wonder as befe  the first books but what else is there can a person thk of that wasn't befe? a defe  must read  you like this series
As I said above no wds And that's unusual me beg a wrer This book is by far the best yet though 5 has the possibily of beg greater Sty Of Book 5? The Death Eaters  seems have returned to the wizardg realm someone's tryg to kill Harry  on top of all that Voldemt's comg back! This is well wrten as all the books are As a wrer I can appreciate this By the way Snape RULES  this book! BUY THIS BOOK! You won't be dissapoted!
Many readers complaed that the begngs of the book were wthless  that they could've done whout them but I disagree What Rowlg does  the begng is set up the entire sty  certa deliciously excg parts such as the Quiddch Wld Cup scenes which are defately suprisg  un-put-a-downable She also sets up the big picture  the book as  previous books which features a climatic battle wh Ld Voldemt  as  book 3 an unexpected conclusion volvg Harry's new godfather Sirius Black  the strange character Peter Petigrew Other reviewers have also stated that the book is too dark  violent It's dark but only because Harry is maturg  thgs gettg darker is sometimes what happens especially  Harry's wld which is one filled wh magic danger  wonder everywhere you turn As f the violence that comes wh the darkness  sometimes you just have to deal wh  What else would you do  Harry's place wh a menace like Ld Voldemt hangg around schemg  plottg new ways to kill him  use him as he attempted to do  this book? I f one would defately be petried from fear but Harry was courageous enough to st up to the He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  even escapes (several times now) however narrowly from the evil clutches of Voldemt So violence is necessary here Harry can't just let himself be killed You can wish that Ld Voldemt didn't even tried to do somethg hrible to Harry but  he didn't he wouldn't be the evil archnemesis we know would he? Besides 's Rowlg's sty  so far I thk she's dog an excellent job wh  As f the readers complag that the Harry Potter books are not great  the lerate wld I suggest you get checked back to realtiy Not only are they immensely popular (as were lerate greats Sir Arthur Conan Doyle creat of Sherlock Holmes  Mark Twa which I'm sure you all know) but are classic  their views of courage comg-of-age  when facg darkness The style Rowlg wres  is flowg  easy to follow She isn't too heavy on description though still pays close attention to detail where  really is needed Instead of lavishly decribg Hogwarts  Diagon Alley over  over aga as she had befe she elabates on the character's feelgs which are by far me imptant Although this is true you aren't at all bld  Rowlg's imagative wld All you need is a creative md a hful of Rowlg's descriptive sentences  you're there watchg the greatest Quiddch match take place  crossg your fgers f Harry while he makes his way dangerously through the Triwizard tournament  at the dreadful climatic battle claspg the book hard as you become afraid to read on yet still wantg to know what happens next Another complat of readers was the useless dialouges between characters They may be lengthy but  you really listen to the characters you can see them mature right befe you Harry becomg me darg  brave wh the Dursleys Hermoe lighteng up  stfeng at the subject of House-Elves Ron still scared of spiders  considerg himself po his relationship wh Harry becomg shaky  then wonderful aga Their dialouge is not somethg skip over-most of the sty's hum  them! Wh all these complats  looks like readers are tryg to &quotgrow up&quot  are fgettg the captivatg magic of the actual sty Who really cares about the technical thgs  happengs  the book? I certaly don't I just want a sty A sty that will give me characters to love hate cherish care  want to know better A sty that will give the good characters an adventerous plot they deserve A sty wh a delicious style Rowlg has served me that sty I should thk that she has done the same f you Stop complag Stop tryg to pick at the book  crisize  Instead enjoy  like a book shouldbe If you didn't like  don't ever read  aga If you miss  then perhaps you like  after all If not fe but I defately don't want to hear  I'm sure other loyal Harry Potter fans won't eher I hope this has helped you I also reccomend the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman They are a wonderful group of books  like Harry Potter are sometimes misunderstood f their beauty  complexy Happy readgbe If you didn't like  don't ever read  aga If you miss  then perhaps you like  after all If not fe but I defately don't want to hear  I'm sure other loyal Harry Potter fans won't eher I hope this has helped you I also reccomend the His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman They are a wonderful group of books  like Harry Potter are sometimes misunderstood f their beauty  complexy Happy readg
Reviewer: maureen_dogbrekvast@hotmailcom from Orkneys  After sufferg havg to read the first three of these mediocre derivative  unspirg books to my daughter this latest stalment really plumbs the depths At least half of the book is expendable  extraneous to the &quotplot&quot one can only image  beg added as paddg to distend this overbloated book even further What ltle plot there is meers to such an extent that any narrative momentum is lost The dialogue is embarrassgly mediocre The use of metaph  imagery is rudimentary so say the least Anyone who has read children's fiction widely over the last 30 years  so will recognise this smgasbd of tried  tested fictional themes ltle of s content beg truly novative  terestg The contug populary of these books really is beyond belief
Usually  a series of books you expect f them to become less tense but not so  Harry Potter This book was better than the rest  I have thought that wh every new one I have read It is entertag  realistic  draws you to the book
First the good news:  One star f  beg a Harry Potter book  f JK Rowlg stayg commed to such a complex series after all this time One star f  havg an terestg plot volvg the Triwizard Tournament  havg the usual twisted endg  One star f the flowg  unique style of wrg that the auth keeps up throughout the book  Now the bad news:  Today's society stks Many people have been sayg that the violence  Harry Potter books is common Violence is everywhere It's on TV  movies  the newspaper  books  even wse  real le I agree that the violence is common (I'm not sayg that supernatural violence is common just violence  general) But I process what people are sayg to them sayg that violence is acceptable that today's society of violence is okay  that the violence  a book doesn't matter  doesn't affect anyone Violence first of all is wrong If people just want to igne that fe Harry Potter's violence is supernatural  sometimes not But at least there are some good virtues  the book to look up to Unftunately wrers these days seem to be sayg that we need violence  der to have courage sacrice etc And we don't Harry Potter is a fun series about these virtues but Rowlg is really just a mediocre auth wh a great style of wrg that captivates I have to give her cred f that but otherwise she's just like any other auth who says to me that you need violence to have all those good characteristics She's also sayg that you need magic  der to have power  control Hopefully there will be a dferent st of message  further books I only took one star off so as to not make people angry I'm not sayg that you shouldn't read this book I'm just sayg that you should read  wh a me mature md Instead of startg   restartg  as many people have already wh a thought of the book just beg a good sty  a piece fiction start  knowg what the book could say to you Happy readg
 As the series goes on the Harry Potter books have become darker  a lot me serious Harry who has aged 4 years sense the first book has grown up But this "growg up" may be a b too fast f most of the series' younger fansWhen the first book came out  was a fairly good-sized book 250 pages  Now wh 700+ pages  is begng to look like a series f older kids The characters "fd their hmones" as the auth puts   not only decide to start  As the series stretches on characters start gettg volved romantically  start cussg among other thgs  But the darkness is surprisg  is nothg a thirteen-year old can't hle  All of the 'maturg' hapeng is very realistic but fans that started readg Harry when he first came out  1998 at the age of 9 are now only 11 - anid have aged 2 years relative to Harry's 4  they may not be maturg as fast as Harry  Also the magic takes a slight turn from the 'Cderella' magic me towards the "Blair Wch" type  And of course anyone who grows up looses thier nocence  is exposed to me  me grizzley thgs - but the problem is that as Harry is growg up kids aren't growg as fast
This book is truly a great book  the Harry Potter series  It is my fave  It does seem a b long at times but the end is the best part of any book I have ever read  It is very well wrten wh highs  lows thgoughout the school year  JK Rowlg is the only auth I know who could actually perfm given the credible expectations of this book  She leaves the ends open to leave all Harry Potter fans beggg f me  I look fward to readg book 5 very much  I can't wa until is released after this!  I read the whole book  less than three days!  A masterpiece  the cnerstone of the Harry Potter series  Everythg about this bok makes  a must read!
I'm a 13 year old girl  wh all the time to wry about boys  clothes I had to read these 4 books The Goblet of Fire was such a good book I passed up the Home-Run Durbie (  I love baseball ) to fish the book It was over 700 pages  I read   like 3 days Alot of people thk that this book is  but bef you jugde  read !! And me beg a 13 year old girl LOVED !!
I have just only become a Harry Potter fanatic but was enchanted from the first chapter of The Scer's Stone  I read the first three books wh a week fishg each  a day  The fourth however was too long to read  one day as I was busy wh wk  other commtments  It was the best one of the series by far though  It has so many me twists  mysteries that you have no clue to the outcome even though you are lead to believe that you know what's gog to happen  I wouldn't recommend startg wh this one as  is always best to start from the begng of the sty but i urge everyone who is terested  curious about the series to read up to this book  It is wth the time  energy   sends your imagation through a wonderful journey of fantasy  wonder
JK Rowlg has truly wrten a gem  the Goblet of Fire  In this book Harry must face test after test  which he not only proves himself to be a fmidable wizard but he learns a lot about his past present  futureThis book is darker than the first three books  However the dark parts do not really start until the last few chapters  However death  murder do play some large roles  this book  I would not recommend this book f young children sce they may not completely underst the signicance of death  the true violence of murder  However I believe children can read this book  they underst me about some of the darker themesI gave this book 5 stars sce I believe  to be a great piece of lerature  It is wrten well enough to keep both children  adults riveted to the book  I have purchased hardbacks so that the books will last a long time  my children will be able to enjoy them as well
Havg read the entire series aloud to my 9 year-old ( havg enjoyed at least the first book) I have to say that  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot had not been part of the Harry Potter series I doubt  would have been published The plot meers  the language is often awkward  repetive It seems too that Rowlg is creasgly usg the convenience of magical &quotdeus ex machas&quot to avoid well thought-out plot resolutions  This is one book where bigger is defely not better If children are gog to vest the time  such a long book they might be better turng to the classics - the Narnia tales  even Peter Pan
The fourth volume  the Harry Potter series Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire moves the action  drama of the series up several notches while retag much of the humour  This epic (734 pages  nary a wasted wd) by auth J K Rowlg achieves the almost impossible task of livg up to the hype  There have been complats about the violence  this particular volume but  is hled wh skill  is a necessary element as the evil lurkg throughout the series becomes me palpably real  physical wh this sty  the results are appropriately terryg  This is a book to be devoured a number of times until the fth  this excg series makes s appearance  I have gushed enough read 
's very very long (750 pages) but 's not bg n anythg bad just so nice 's harry potter what are u expectg this book to be like? just nice read!
i thk this book can help me to image about magic wld
What can I say???  This book rocks!  I read  three times  every time I was captured by s strong suspense  trigue  When I purchased the first Harry Potter book "Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone" from  I was expectg a good book but soon found that  was an excellent book  And then the followg books #2  #3 just kept gettg better  better  Then when I picked up a copy of the anticipated 4th book I was blown away  How JK Rowlg was able to wre such a fascatg book was a mystery to me  But hey whatever she's dog she's sure dog a good job at !So here's the verdict - buy this book!  You won't regret !
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an amazg book  I thk  is JK Rowlg's best book out of the series yet  The book is so descriptive  action-pakced that  keeps you on your toes throughout the whole thg  You feel as though you are takg the adventures wh Harry  his friends The plot is beyond anyone's wildest imagation  I would highly recommend purchasg this book
JK Rowlg has wrten another best-seller wh this book!  The book starts off as the other three books: Harry wh the Dureleys befe gog to Hogwarts  However this book turns to some me serious issues such as jealousy  &quotrights&quot  even death  This book defely is darker than the other three books  However the darker parts of the book do not occur until the end where Harry views the past  comes face-to-face wh Voldemt  I recommend this book to everyone but I question  some younger children are ready f two dark parts of this book: death  murder
When I heard about the Harry Potter hype I just laughed  off as another fad like slap bracelets  tickle-me-elmo's  But then slowly enough people I knew were readg Harry Potter  One of my friend's mother's ran out  bought the second book the DAY  came out on hard cover  She usually heads straight to the library!  Of course I kept shruggg  off flipped the channel when the &quotmidnight sales&quot were on the news but when I realized I had to read these books were when I was babystg a while ago  The young girl I babys f asked me to read her Harry Potter  Nights after nights we went through chapters  chapters  pretty soon I found myself lookg fward to readg them as much as she was  Well eventually I headed down to the library  browed my own copies  read them allWell THAT's what the big deal was about  I've never heard of anyone wh such an credably creative  trigug md  The books are ALL just wonderful tricate terestg creations  They go to so much detail about the wizardg wld  how thgs are  of course about those hrible Dursley's that any respectable Harry Potter fan despises  JK Rowlg created her own ltle wld  then ved us all  through wrg these books  I am never one to turn down an vation!However f those of you especially parents wried about the &quotsatanistic&quot wizardry calm your fears there is nothg remotely satanistic  immal  These books show wonderful examples of courage bravery comradery  all the virtues you could ever want  your children  Once you go beyond  imagative wld of w wavg you get to the pure foundation of the novel  Friendship heroism  adventure  And really what American  Br  any other nationaly  religion could argue wh that?
I can't tell you how amazed I am at how the kids I have taught have grabbed hold of Harry! These are well-wrten  tensely excg Far better to read HP than most of of the other boy-hero books And the usual lot: Goosebumps  the rest are just a lerary waste of time However I'm disappoted  some of the me diabolical characters Be sure to discuss this wh your me impressionable childrenIn all the Harry Potter books are telligent F the kids who thk the Babysters Club  Goosebumps are the best the wld start wh Harry Then wk your way over on the shelf to read the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis  f real depth of plot  style see JRR Tolkien's &quotLd of the Rgs&quotDue to the heavy commercialization of the HP books I doubt HP will make to the ranks of classic books They'll be sadly too diluted wh pop-culture to make  But f today they'll serve as a nice segue to the classicsBuy  but wh the caveat there are better books  this genre
So many people fight the &quotAre Harry Potter books satanic&quot fight that they overlook all the children who've turned off their televisions  video games  are immersed  a book that looks to the casual observer as imposg as Moby Dick  I was just amazed when I learned that every kid I ran across had read every wd of this 734 page book  This is what parents  educats across America have been searchg f f years a book that kids can get as exced about as the next release of a video game  I thk that Rowlg's books are the best thg to come to America  a long time
I loved this book  It was a lot longer than the other books but every page is filled wh hum  action  I have read  like 3 times  I like this book me than the other three put together  I would defately suggest this book to any potential buyers  I love this book   you already own   have read  read  aga 's just as enjoyable the secound  third time
When I first heard this book would be over 700 pages (734 to be exact) I'll be honest: I panicked Sure I'm a loyal Harry Potter fan--but there was no way all those pages could have any relevance That kd of thg is only  stuff like the Bible books wrten over hundreds of years Well simply truth is I was wrong You can look at any page  fd somethg that manipulates this plotle Somethg that matters Somethg you HAVE TO READ! THIS BOOK IS *GOOD*! Don't have the time to read ? Make time Take a vacation Read a chapter a day you'll be done  a month--that is  you have the willpower to lim yourself to a chapter a day
this book was great! everybody should read the harry potter series!
When i read the first three harry potter books i honestly only did  because i had nothg better to read  The books weren't hrible but they also weren't exactly masterpieces  The thg that I didn't like about the first three was that their endgs were at times a ltle b too predictable  Overall the fourth was much better wrten although  can be a ltle slow  the begng  you're not really to   Also  was not predictable  the endg wasn't as "happy go lucky" as the other books had been  It seems as  Rowlg directed this book me so towards the older audience  This book has defately made a harry potter fan out of me  I can't wa f the fth book to come out
When my older sister led me the book I was sceptical but after readg the first book I rushed the very next day to buy the followg three  The further you go to the sty the better  gets  Rowlgs is very creative  imagative  is amazg how an auth can come up wh such characters  such trigues  Now I can't wa f the fth one
My son age 7 has Asperger's a mild fm of autism Usually that means a sht attention span except  areas he fds fascatg Until now alas that area has been PokemonLast Christmas at the recommendation of a Who Wants To Be A Millionaire contestant I met on the net I started readg the first book  the series to him at night It was a longshot but what was there to lose? To my amazement not only did I thoughly enjoy the sty myself but my son was enthralled!Each of the books as well as havg hum  plot has a number of mysteries Not only did my son recognize that there were mysteries he was able  some cases to wk out the clues  predict what was gog to happen next The books have built his attention span his logical reasongs his conversational skills  most imptantly made him happyJK Rowlg's book has lerally made my son a better person How often can you say that about a book?We've sce read all four books  the series  he wants to read them aga (I'm tryg to get him started on the Narnia Chronicles stead)Now here's the most shockg part The Harry Potter movie will be comg out this November He says he doesn't want to see  He has rather vivid imagery of what the Hogwart characters all look  sound like  from the previews he's concerned that the film won't match his imagation Good f you son!
Ok this book is REALLY good! It's full of action suspense drama  mystery If I weren't from Earth I would give  5 thumbs up!
When I first heard of the Harry Potter books I gagged at the mass of media display  I was imediately turned off  However I went on a trip to my Grparents house f a week last summer ago  found that they were fond readers of the collection I sat down to the first book  read the first few chapters I was right  thkg I wouldn't like them that was until I started readg the second  then the third Later I then read the first which wked out fe I had massive headaches from the eye stra  gave me to read these adventureous sties full of everythg I thk this wld could use me of Others have their opions  I much respect them I also have my own opions  Christians view this book as a way of the spreadg of evil  dog  though our children I read the fourth book the day I got    was the longest book I have ever read  actually enjoyed  As i set  down I felt accomplisted  proud  The ironic thg about my trip was that not only have my grparents have read  listened to all of the books but my grfather is a well-known retired Christian Mister They enjoyed these books I loved them myself!! This proves that  doesn't matter what age you read  at  the supposed effect but me what the reader gas from readg JK Rowlg credible touchg books I would have given  10 stars but  wasn't an option Read   decide f yourself!!!
JK Rowlg is an outstg auth! She makes this magical wld seem very le-like  real By addg just enough detail  description  is hard to believe that Hogwarts isn't real! I also love this book f the style  how even though many questions are answered from previous books there are still many questions left to keep us hangg  to concoct theies wh So  turn I highly highly HIGHLY recommend this book  all Harry Potter books to you  may you become an obsessed fan like me!
Sure the books are an OK read but they lack both the telligence  the basic lerary foundations to become anythg me than bra cy The books are both filled wh cliches one dimensional characters (hermione Ron  Harry to name a few)  laughable ane villas who are both stupid  the 'diet pepsi' of evilThis book does not deserve the recognion that  has recieved It is  a waste of time to read  does not impart the reader wh anythg wthwhile  (oh  BTW I am  the target age range f the 'harry potter' books)
Three wdsI  LOVE  POTTER! These are THE best books EVER wrten I can't emphasise enough how good a book these all are JK Rowlg ROCKS!
As a fantasy sty-teller about the wld of magic JK Rowlg has enjoyed remarkable success  The adventures of Harry Potter  his friends at Hogwarts the school where young wizards learn the skills of magic are highly imagative  thoughly enjoyable  It is no wonder that this series has captured the imagation of children  given pleasure even to adults  Many of Rowlg's concepts are strongly remiscent of the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by Enid Blyton  Roald Dahl  she likely has been fluenced by their wk  But Rowlg clearly has a style of her own   this fourth book of the Harry Potter series has confirmed her reputation as a sty-teller f children This novel has all the gredients of a good children's novel - suspense imagation  excementThe remarkable populary of the Harry Potter series has led to s auth JK Rowlg beg frequently mentioned  the same breath as the fantasy greats JJR Tolkien  CS Lewis  Yet this is not entirely deserved because the wks of Tolkien  Lewis go far beyond the level of sty impartg great truths about human nature  theology on a deeper level Rowlg's books do not have this deeper level but are simply imagative books that enterta  That is not to say that Rowlg's novels are not good They clearly are The credible sales recd of the Harry Potter series tells s own sty of successThe Harry Potter series has been much cricized f the extent to which magic has been cpated to the sty-le  the creasg terest  the dark side of magic has left people wonderg whether Rowlg is leavg the do open to the occult  Rowlg herself has publicly denied any personal terest  the occult  explicly repudiated beg an advocate of the occult  tendg to attract children to   Most of the magic she describes is clearly fantastic  bears ltle relation to the magic of the occult  Yet  must be conceded that there is a growg contempary revival of the occult  that occultic themes  ideas are hardly absent from Harry Potter's wld but rather play a key role    When accompanied wh an creasgly dark  macabre tone this element did make me seriously question whether the Harry Potter books are suable f childrenBut  the end  is not the magic of Harry Potter that has made  so successful  The real reason is that readers can identy wh s characters Although Rowlg describes a fantasy wld that exists only  her imagation  ours  is clear that this fantasy wld is largely a mirr image of our own 20th/21st century Western wld What makes this series so successful is that we recognize ourselves  the novel - our system of education (Hogwarts) our ideology of human rights (Hermione's fight f the elves) our wship of team spts (the quiddich wld cup) our love f competion (the tri-wizard contest) our polical wld (mistry of magic) our media (terviews wh the Daily Prophet) our concern wh health  beauty our fascation wh love  guy-girl relationships  our love of feastg  food (The Yule Ball)  Unlike Tolkien's "Ld of the Rgs"  Lewis' "Narnia Chronicles" which are me demg  deep because they bear ltle resemblance to our wld Rowlg's wld of "Harry Potter" bears a great deal of resemblance to our contempary godless wld  s idols  Although "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is outwardly about a fantasy wld beneath the fantastic trimmgs  is essentially about our own wld And that is why we love t be conceded that there is a growg contempary revival of the occult  that occultic themes  ideas are hardly absent from Harry Potter's wld but rather play a key role    When accompanied wh an creasgly dark  macabre tone this element did make me seriously question whether the Harry Potter books are suable f childrenBut  the end  is not the magic of Harry Potter that has made  so successful  The real reason is that readers can identy wh s characters Although Rowlg describes a fantasy wld that exists only  her imagation  ours  is clear that this fantasy wld is largely a mirr image of our own 20th/21st century Western wld What makes this series so successful is that we recognize ourselves  the novel - our system of education (Hogwarts) our ideology of human rights (Hermione's fight f the elves) our wship of team spts (the quiddich wld cup) our love f competion (the tri-wizard contest) our polical wld (mistry of magic) our media (terviews wh the Daily Prophet) our concern wh health  beauty our fascation wh love  guy-girl relationships  our love of feastg  food (The Yule Ball)  Unlike Tolkien's "Ld of the Rgs"  Lewis' "Narnia Chronicles" which are me demg  deep because they bear ltle resemblance to our wld Rowlg's wld of "Harry Potter" bears a great deal of resemblance to our contempary godless wld  s idols  Although "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is outwardly about a fantasy wld beneath the fantastic trimmgs  is essentially about our own wld And that is why we love 
If I was a kid I would idolize this book ( all the others)  As  is at 46 I am still utterly enchanted  One does not learn anythg new about what good wrg is from Ms Rowlg but one certaly learns enough about fictional vention to fill a dozen Pensieves -- her imagation is dazzlg  utterly unflaggg  this area  Mad-Eye Moody is the most fascatg adult character sce Dumblede the Weasley tws contue to steal scenes  Harry's vis to the merpeople is a real gem (among many  this book)  The only other thg to be said is &quotHarry Potter&quot mes  melds so many wonderful kds of sties -- school mischief droll hum suspense mystery comg of age Dickensian oppression by eccentric authies --  just goes on  on -- so that when one dimension takes a break you can always tune  on another
There is nothg beond my likg than readg a good book Harry Potter does not f a good book The Harry Potter books are describable There is no other way to put  The essence of the books pulls you through an adventure wh danger  excment The books enchant your md  soul buildg up a mounta of love  joy The auth helps us relate to old memies reachg back  time to rememberg our choldhood You remember enemies friends   the end just someone who will always reach out a helpg h  The books show Harry havg hard timeshis parents dyglivg wh mugglesetc Still showg the hatred of this book she still shows the good times just beg able to s down  share memies wh friends I thk we can all relate to the Harry Potter books as our own child self side our heart I also believe that Harry Potter is not just someone else but ourselves  disguise tryg to fd the right path down which we all shall head As far as Harry Potter goes there is nothong me irresistable  refreshg as readg one of JK Rowlg's books
I loved this book! This series was just what I needed! JKRowlg troduses new thgs  the wizardg wld(snufflers  tents that have many rooms  ) The book keeps poppg up wh hts of somethg imptant but  is impossible to pay attion to every detail The defence agast the dark arts teacher is very terestg  weird(how long can JKRowlg keep makg up new  terestg people)? I spent a waste of time readg one star reviews Not one of them said somethg that is relistic  supptive of what they try to say1 Harry potter is sudenly tersested  girls That is not entirely crect Harry has a crush on a Cho Chang Part of that could be dew to puberty 2 Harry has no depth(as well as other charaters) I will have to adm that I don't connect wh the charaters but thay are very rich  persanalty Snape flexg his hs every time he looks at harry as  wantg to strangle him is an example 3 It is bg  predicatble  WARNING DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK Can these people honestly say they knew  suspected Crouch's son was alive??? Of course not! He died ater beg  prison f a yearCan people say they knew Snape  Karkarof are death eaters??? Of course not! By the way I don't thk Karkarof is gog to live to see 2 me christmassI enjoyed this book  hope I can meet someone who does not like this book so I can see  they can suppt themselvesHarry touchg the right thg only at the griose climax of the fal task of the triwizard tournament was kd of havg the bad guys unnecesarily puttg all odds agast themselves f such a long period of time  Though they eventually succeeded these supossedly cunng dark mds would get que low sces  low-risk planngThis said well this 4th book has defely many thgs that deserve the greatest compliments as you can surely see  probably all reviews  The most telligent scenario Rowlg has conceived so far  these 4 books  my opion is when Harry is under his visibily cloak trapped  the stairs  front of Snape  Filch  Moody helps him  fds out about the marauders map  Only close to the end of the book you realize why this moment when Moody is lookg at the map  front of Harry was such a crical one what was at stake what was really gog on there  Really amazgly clever By the way I would bet this map idea of Rowlg was probably directly spired by certa computer games  I also thk the magic diary  the second book was probably directly spired by palm computers  Just guesses anywayA fal comment about the alleged discrepancy  the der  which Harry's parents died  That could be explaed que reasonably well though  a tricky way  We all know Harry survived the killg curse all together  The &quotAveda Kedavra&quot curse can therefe be beaten  Now what happens when  is not beaten?  It seems reasonable to thk  may not cause technically stantaneous death  Voldemt reptedly attacked Harry's father first  then Harry's mother  It's plausible to thk Harry's father may have survived a few seconds after receivg the fatal curse  (Who knows befe actually dyg because of the Voldemt's curse he probably even wnessed Voldemt's downfall when attemptg to kill his son after havg killed his we)Well no doubt fascatg imagation  lessons Rowlg has displayed  shared  these Harry Potter books  Thanks f thatd so far  these 4 books  my opion is when Harry is under his visibily cloak trapped  the stairs  front of Snape  Filch  Moody helps him  fds out about the marauders map  Only close to the end of the book you realize why this moment when Moody is lookg at the map  front of Harry was such a crical one what was at stake what was really gog on there  Really amazgly clever By the way I would bet this map idea of Rowlg was probably directly spired by certa computer games  I also thk the magic diary  the second book was probably directly spired by palm computers  Just guesses anywayA fal comment about the alleged discrepancy  the der  which Harry's parents died  That could be explaed que reasonably well though  a tricky way  We all know Harry survived the killg curse all together  The &quotAveda Kedavra&quot curse can therefe be beaten  Now what happens when  is not beaten?

Too many plot holes to fall to Too many cartoonish characters Too many ridduculous sub plots that seem to be gog nowhere Too many mumbo-jumbo jargon (Did anyone ed the book?)Anyway I agree wh many readers about how silly the Ptkey thg was  how imposter Mad-Eye Moody could've just given Harry a ptkey  get  over wh Then there are the cartoonish characters At the end of the book when Dumblede  Cnelius Fudge fought I thought about just how ridduculous that was Dumblede is an odd name So is Cnelius Fudge Also both of them are odd  funny characters They don't seem to be ones to fight about these st of thgs The sub plots wh sub plots wh sub plots Hermoe wh the house elves It went pretty much nowhere Harry  Ron's crumblg relationship They got all all happy-sappy later which made the whole thg kd of wthless Fred  Gege got bad grades Their mother gets mad  then is cryg f them aga The female characters seem to be dog a lot of that lately I st of wish that Rowlg would stop tryg to be realistic because 's really annoyg Mumbo-jumbo jargon You know Rowlg you could've saved a lot of trees from beg cut down  you just used 'as ' stead of 'as though' Sure 's style but you have style everywhere The detail felt articial  tacked on Harry's adventure wh love was strange too It felt as  Rowlg had just thought: oh yeah Harry needs a crush  somethg Overall  was still a dangerously seductive  addictive book as all Harry Potter books are so Rowlg as not lost her touch The three stars are f that I truly hope that the fth sixth  seventh aren't as dark as Rowlg says they will be because that will mean me arguments between Dumblede  Fudge to laugh at me Harry-Ron-Hermoe relationship problems that will be rather annoyg me mumbo-jumbo jargon screamg f an ed me hrible plot holes that will get deeper  deeper  me cartoonish characters that will make the over-sized cast seem like an episode of Loony Tunesnd deeper  me cartoonish characters that will make the over-sized cast seem like an episode of Loony Tunes

I've read the spanish edion of all 4 books about Harry Potter The first one was fun because  was new even when  was aimed to children The second was simple  perhaps repeatg the fmula The 3rd was great ! A great endg  a lot of surprises by the way But  the 4th as Harry reaches matury JKR also does She is not afraid to raise issues as slavery racism  the cravg f power Yet this is a book f kids but  is also a book f adults You can learn a lot of lessons f le wh  As CSLewis  JRRTolkien did befe JKRowlg books are growg bigger better  me mature I hope the best f Harry Potter  i wish i would be able to read books about Harry Potter  his 75 birthday In the meantime we all will be lookg f Voldemt
This is not only one of the most amazg books I've ever read but 's also one of my faves Rarely can you fd a book this good that both adults  kids enjoy  In this book the same old characters are back  better then ever but there also new ones that are just as cool There's also a much bigger focus on fave wch game Quiddch  Harry once aga fds himself  the middle of some awesome adventures There's also a surprisg plot twist  the end which will have you at the edge of your seat
I didn't want to get hooked to another series  REALLY I didn't!  But these books just get better  better - one after another  this just keeps that tradion gog  I should tell you - I'm 31 years old  I'm a full grown adult  These are not books that only kids will enjoy you will get as much pleasure from this as from any Tom Clancy  Stephen Kg  Judh Krantz novel (maybe even me!)
I loved this book  I have read some of the other reveiws  i noticed many people like this book  But i noticed that a few found  to violent  Well this may be true but thk about todays society  Now compare all the violence to the violence  this boook what do you come up wh  Harry Potter has way less violence  Plus sometimes  makes the book me excg  me lelike all  all this is a great book  i recomend 
This is one of those rare books that makes you want to read everythg sce the begng!Wh a lot of emotion  the best end ever! I'm crazy to read Harry Potter  the Order of Phoenix now!!!!And f my brasilian friends who still have doubts about read: Leiam!!!!

Are you ready to get blown off your seat f a great book?!  Then read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  The best book  the seriesI thkfilled wh action surprises  a excellent endg  Read this book!
I began readg Harry Potter at the suggestion of a friend  I would have only knownThe goblet of fire has to be one the best books I have ever read  As I child I read the box car children the polk street school books sweet valley   only I would have had Harry Potter f books as a child  I love Harry Potter that is the only wd to expla them  It is great to see children all over the wld readg these books they open your md to new thgs  help then wh their imagations  I read several reviews of the book befe wrg me own  I want to say to all those who gave Harry Potter 1 star you are all fools  To those people who say these books violate Christa beliefs I say shame on you!!  And to those people who hide these books from their Children I say that you are closg dos f your own children  In this day  age we need to keep all dos open  Harry Potter helps children keep their dos open  These books can open there mds so much me then the Box Car Children ever did f me I thank my parents that I love to read  that I love readg Harry Potter! I am so lookg fward to the next 3 books!
I have to say that when I started readg Harry Potter I thought they were the STUPIDEST books I had ever seen  my le  However after fcg myself to see what the heck everyone was talkg about I tried readg them aga- found myself posively hooked  The adventures of Harry Ron  Hermione struck a chd  me as well as many other people!  Harry Potter is not as so many thk an 'evil' book they thk  is so evil why do they voice their opionnobody's fcg them to read !  But anyway the Harry Potter books are deed my fave yeah I've read me books than alot of people have  their letimes  No exaggeration there folkssimply truth Harry Potter I concede simply takes the lead  I do expect the Potter fad will go out sooner  later but there WILL be fahful people who contue to devour the lerature of the now-famous JK Rowlg  I f one am simply IMPRESSED wh the fantastic books Ms Rowlg has produced delighted by the plot le  complexy of !  At the end of the Goblet of Fire the LAST thg I was expectg was f Mad-Eye Moody to be on Voldemt's sidebut he was to actually fd out that the Malfoys suppted himI look fward the fth book [which today I found out is not comg out until ***2002!!!!*** [grrrr   a snf]   is my hope that Sirius Black's name is cleared too let Harry have some love  joy wh REAL family's too bad they don't have a spell to brg back dead people f I would surely like to meet Lily  James Potter  Sirius Black is trigug  how Ms Rowlg came up wh HIM is beyond mebut as I have said I'm delightedsimply delighted also I REALLY hope Dumblede is made the new Mister of Magiccuz Cnelius Fudge doesn't seem up to the job  Okay enough babblgsee you all at the Harry Potter movie!  :D  -[as most of mie 'peeps' know me]Dez
A great book the best one yet  As f those who say 's too dark GIVE ME A BREAK!  You can't protect your kids fever they see  here stuff at school  on TV daily that's way darker than this  Also I thk the sudden seriousness Rowlg created makes the sty me appealg  I can't wa to see how the Mistry of Magic deals wh the rebirth of Voldermt  the next book As f you IDIOTS who say that magic is the wk of the Devil get a le  Some of the most famous fantasy auths  histy were revered Christians  Also don't you thk callg what you don't underst evil is a ltle outdated?  I suppose you people would prefer we still held wch trials   everyone thought like you we wouldn't have electricy right now What I'm tryg to say is lighten up people you only live once  Don't waste your time on earth tellg everybody that has an igal thought they're gog to go to hell
If you are wonderg why I gave this two stars stead of 1 star  5 stars then let me expla the reason I'm givg Rowlg two stars is because of her abily to make somethg as evil as wchcraft look nocent Inside the Harry Potter books they use actually spells that are used by wchs  wizards do you want your kids to know this I sure don't This is evil stuff that should be banned  burn curse Rowlg f speardg evil to our children
This is not a young children's book -- this is thematically an adult novel which happens to feature teens as s viewpot characters wrten at a teens--older readg level  My sons are 10  7 years old  I am readg them a chapter a night from Book numbers 1 & 2  the series  I'm not sure however about Book number 3  I'm defely not readg this Book 4  the series to them as they simply aren't mature enough to hle  -- deed by the time they *are* mature enough f this volume they'll be past wantg sties read to them  That said I applaud Ms Rowlg  her strong ethical stance  this post-modern era  Like the late Robert Hele she offers guidance  the guise of entertament  also like him does  so extradarily well that cash customers are willg to pay despe the didacticism  Conservative Christians who object to the stage-settg  termology of the Potter books miss the entire pot  This  the other books  the series are powerful voices  fav of *very* tradional values: courage hon compassion loyalty honesty redemption  just pla human decency  There's no doubt here about the existence of evil  the necessy to st aganst   Buy  f your young children?  No  Buy  f your teen-ager?  Defely yes
Like many parents I started out readg the Harry Potter series to my children  found myself hooked I thought #4 was a good addion to the series because of the added depth of style  the obvious changes occurrg wh the characters as they get older There have been a lot of complats regardg the &quotdarkness&quot of this book but I challenge those reviewers to present a scenario that volves the return to power of a Powerful  Evil Wizard that isn't a b dark! I thought she did an excellent job presentg this  I also suppt her decision to kill one of the characters Le isn't all peaches  cream sometimes 's dangerous  I thk children realize this better than adults do sometimes Those children who have lost friends  loved ones may fd  easier to cope wh their loss by relatg to the characters  this styI did have a few problems wh the book which is why I only gave  4 stars:1) Many thgs from the &quotlynch mob&quot of Death Eaters after the Quiddch Wld Cup tmentg the Muggle family to the speech flections attude etc of the House Elf Wky makes me thk the auth is copyg  makg light of the fmer African-American slavery  America Wky sounds suspiciously like the auth browed her character straight out of Gone Wh The Wd (I don't know nuth 'bout birth' no dragons)  the image is made complete by Hermione's mission to free them  everyone else's assumption that they are happiest beg enslaved2) The auth dedicates a lot of energy  righteous dignation to Hermione's effts to liberate the house elves  then  juststops I guess the girl just got bed of tryg to free the slaves Happens I guess3) Why oh why was their an entire tournament of chance volved  all the Imposter Moody had to do was get Harry to touch a ptkey? Harry trusted Moody almost from the start  wouldn't have been that dficultAll  all though  was a good book that left me wantg f me Harry is an excellent hero far removed from typical children's book heros who are the underdogs until the end of the book when somethg miraculous happens Harry doesn't take guff from anyone  he's a wnerll  all though  was a good book that left me wantg f me Harry is an excellent hero far removed from typical children's book heros who are the underdogs until the end of the book when somethg miraculous happens Harry doesn't take guff from anyone  he's a wner
This was by far the best book i have ever read I have all the Harry Potter books read them all me than once  this one was still the best of the 4 It was full of suspense that made me keep on readg even though i said i would stop I actually give this book 10 stars not 5 I would recommend this book to anyone of any age This book will leave you countg the days until the 5th book comes out  2002! Enjoy!
JK Rowlg is brilliant she must've known what she was gog to wre throughout the whole book befe she even started! This book is awesome  i reccomend  to everyone  will defately touch your heart! JK Rowlg is also very descriptive  her wrgs  i can see all the charachters  settg picture-perfect  my md  this book is jus great I can't wa f the next book  the movie!
This credible New Yk Times Bestseller is the most popular book  my letime Deeply absbg  fascatg Harry Potter enjoys yet another spellbdg year at Hogwarts Even me tense than the previous three books Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the dream book f children of all ages Just the thought of a extradary  complex wld of magic will blow anyone's md The ma reason f Harry Potter's great success is that J K Rowlg images this Brish school just like any other nmal school however she adds an engagg twist which is to fill this school wh supernatural creatures  magical people who live as wizards  wches  This year at Hogwarts however Harry will not play  the usual excg Quiddch Cup stead a novel activy will be added to the agenda The Goblet of Fire has yet to make s signicant decision: Who will be chosen? This year Hogwarts will compete wh other magical schools around the globe Only one brave representative will be chosen to achieve three amazg tasks  You-Know-Whoare still after Harry  will stop at nothg to even [get] him Harry feels safe  the strong walls of Hogwarts but is this a false sense of secury?  The action  entertament  this book never stop Please read 
I Like to thk of this book not only f young kids but f all kids this book gives children a vivid imagation  helps them underst why books can be great  this book is  filled wh details  themes  gives the reader somethg to dream about wonder about  This is a fantastic non fiction fantasy book that helps children get off from watchg TV  lets them sk to there own imagation of a wld unlike there own 
Amazg! This describes my le exactly-- only Harry is a boy does magic lives  Engl  has a lot me adventures But I thk everyone can identy wh Harry He is a Real Kid I bought copies of this f me my three teens (age 1615  13) stocked up the public library shelves I can hardly wa f the next one!
In book one you get to know Harry his friends  enemies  book two you just fd out a ltle me about Hagrid  Voldemt (although the sty is extremely good)  book three you fd out how Voldemt found his parents to kill them you get to know James Potter's friends  a ltle me about their relationship wh Severus Snape (as well as a lot me I can't tell you  here)Enough of troductions this is where the real action begs besides fdg out what the suation was when Voldemt was at his full power you'll see a stronger me determed  even me powerful Harry Potter on this book he will be fced to fight f his le not only  an ancient tradional wizard contest but he'll face his enemies  will have to defend himself   dieWh a great  unexpected endg like the ones J K Rowlg has already gotten us used to this is by far the scariest me thrilg book of the series so far believe me you'll be beggg f time to pass quickly so you can get your hs on the fth book ASAP
As a mother of three  a devout Christian I have enjoyed the Harry Potter series up until now  The first three books although not equal were all fun  imagative wh just enough suspense  adventure to be excg This book was simply too dark  disturbg f children   bothers me that Harry Potter marketg is creasgly beg aimed at children as the books themselves are becomg less child-like  This book was ridiculously long  sely needed an ed  I was very unsettled by the crease  not just bad language but also unkd talk  thoughts between characters who are supposed to be the &quotgood guys&quot  F stance callg one another names wantg to h someone because of disagreement beltlg one another the list goes on  on  The whole thg just left a bad taste  Wst of all was the unbelievably cruel  abrupt death of Cedric surely the most noble of all the characters  this book cludg Harry!  Ms Rowlg seems to want to troduce me adult concepts  her books  I underst that desire but  that is the plan the marketg should not be aimed at children  Of course children are me fgivg readers than adults are  the obvious plot holes don't bother them as much  The most obvious one beg why didn't Mad Eye Moody give Harry a ptkey ANYTIME durg the school year  Altogether a disappotg book  yet still a book about characters that my children have come to know  like  It wked f me to read  aloud to my younger children  Unftunately I allowed my eleven year old to read this book befe I did  I've realized that I will no longer be able to let my children read anyme Harry Potter books until I've read them first  Too bad that parents now need to screen Ms Rowlg's books rather than just enjoy them
This book is one of the best books I have ever read  It is fantastic  I recommend  to anyone  i thk that no one could fail to like   So I hope you have  already  have read  as many times as I have but  you haven'tbuy  now!  See  you can read   less than 3  a half hours - thats what i did the first time I read !
The me I read of this series the me convced I become that JK Rowlg is the JRR Tolkien of our generation  What started out as a whimsical children's series a la Roald Dahl is now veerg to darker but equally captivatg waters as an epic battle between good  evil begs to take shape  I loved this book!  It made me laugh   made me cry  (And I desperately want my own house-elf!  Which of course I plan to clothe  compensate!)  As a Christian I wouldn't hesate to recommend these books to anyone I know  I believe the good Ld gave us our imagations to craft just such well-wrten fantasies  Ms Rowlg has been exceptionally blessed  The theme of good vs evil is val to Chrstian theology just as  is to these wonderfully wrten  delightful novels
This book  all the others  the series are phenomenal reads  I couldn't put them down any of them  read about one a day  I'd fish one then head back to the ste f the next  I'm dyg to read the fth one  can't wa f the movie  Rowlg should be very proud of herself f the thgs she has achieved wh these books  Not only do they enterta children they enterta adults like me as well  The plots are revealed  a timely manner that also allows f the maximum suspense  The characters are very well-developed even the m ones  Rowlg's descriptions are very detailed -- I can almost see Ron asleep durg Profess Bns' lectures!  These books are great  my friends  I all love them very much!
That the next book won't be out f a long time!  Eagerly awag the next stallment  the adventures of Harry Potter  his friends  Our children fd this book totally absbg to read  a real vocabulary-builder
They are the best books ever! I can't stop my self  can't even image what I am gog to do after I fish this one (Harry Potter IV) I have read Chese edion befe but I want to tell you If you can please don't read any translated edion they are absolutely not so good as the igal one There might be some vocabulary there but after one  two chapters you must fd you don't need dictionary any me It is easy  full of fun I don't feel I was readg a giant feign-language book I highly recommend this one f any one still believes  magic  anyone wants to start you first English book I couldn't even wre an English letter now I can
This book seemed to be a good sequel at first - until I read a certa section  the back which had gy violence that I a fourteen year old! could barely hle I mean I went to the bathroom after readg the end  just stood there cryg because  scared me so badly Now I'm not expectg everyone to have the same reaction - I'm sure many people my age could easily hle  no doubt - but this is just a warng to eager kids who haven't read   parents who want to read  aloud to their kids -  is defely not f all who enjoyed the first book
Harry Potter  the Goblet of FireHarry Potter is a wizard a famous wizard This is his fourth year at Hogwart's School of Wchcraft  Wizardy  he is  f a big adventure In this book the Triwizard Tournament is takg place  The Goblet of Fire decides which wizard from each house should enter The Triwizard Tournament cludes a series of tests a wizard has to pass  der to w the Triwizard Cup However Harry's name mysteriously pops out of the goblet whout him puttg   Wst of all someone is wag f Harry-someone evil
When JK Rowlg first tried to publish Harry Potter  the Scerers Stone publishers told her that  was to long f children Children read the book  loved ! The second (longer) book was just as popular The third (longer!) was JUST as popular as the preceedg And then after a long wa the fourth book appeared  broke recds here  there  was amazgly popular! Not only are the styles  the Harry Potter series wonderfully creative  terestg but they are funny clever  enticg They allow children to feel imptant  the length themselves prove that Ms Rowlg does not look down upon children Below average children average  children who have an IQ of 200 have no way of lookg down on this book because  is spectacular This book is very dferent  has started s own genre Three cheers f Harry Potter
The fourth book was very excg  Personally the second one was my fave but this one adds a new twist to the tale  I can't wa f book 5!!
I thought this book was so great  I could not stop Readg this book F hours I would s down  read all day
Harry Potter a lonely 14 year old boy is brought to a wld of imagation where his dreams can come true to fulfill his desty Harry Potter is at his fourth year at Hogwarts School of wchcraft  wizardry  However befe that he wants to go to the Quiddch wld cup where thgs out of the dary happen cludg a sign of Ld Voldemt that hasn't been seen f 13 years  Then at his fth year a competion is takg place that hasn't been competed  f over a hundred years Harry must put his bravery  wisdom first  he is to survive the encounterThe ma conflict to this book is that always be assertive  be true to yourself  you are to ever be all that you can be I recommend that this book can be read anybody who seems terested  this book I like this book because I've always liked fantasy  this book pushes that to s limsI would give this book 5 stars because of s style  well-wrten fm
Five Stars is not enoughThe eloquent  gracious tale of young Master Potter's education (as a wizard  as a person) contues  this LARGE reader of further adventures at HogWartz!If you are new to Ms Rowlg's tales back out to the search screen  get yourself a copy of the first volume [try to locate the UK release  possible but fget locatg a copy at a re-sale shop]  try this semal comg of age wk  a slightly "lighter" varietyIf you couldn't wa [but have waed f some reason] then Your Time Is Now der immediately  get ready to have to avoid any unsympathetic associates as you are swept away yet aga by Harry Ron Albus Hermoe Hedwig Hargid Snape He Who Must Not Be Named Peeves  all the rest durg the contug advenures of our boy Harry
As Harry Potter grows up he starts to get to me serious trouble This time he has an even bigger showdown wh Ld Voldemt which he seems to be able to survive only because of his magical background - a magician growg up wh the harrowg tales of you - know - who's terrible fce would have probably just died of fright seeg him arrise agaWe also see how Harry  his friends fally start growg up  becomg teenagers - gog to balls gettg terested  the oppose gender This 'growg' up is accompanied by a darker mood throughout the whole book which starts out as an cident  the Quiddch Wld Cup when Death Eaters (Ld Voldermt's suppters) cause some trouble   climaxes as we see Ld Voldermt ressurected  starts gatherg his followers aga even though this event was to be expected sce the first book where we learned about the Dark Ld's tries to grab the scere's stoneJK Rowlg still has the knack of ventg many 'magical' surprises f us such as aparatg  'splchg' as new magical tricks que a b me fmation on the dark arts  some histy of the events befe  after Ld Voldermt has fallen  of course - we're beg troduced to dferent wizardg schools  fally underst why Hagrid is so big!The only faults I fd wh this book  I've taken off a star f are:1) The plan of fetchg Harry Potter by lettg him survive through the Triwizard context  then turng the cup to a ptkey sounded a ltle too complex   was hard to guarantee that Harry would even be allowed to compete  wng seems me improbable - why not give him a ptkey  a me simple  direct way when everythg else was ready?2) Hermione's fight f elves' rights started wh a big bang but after a while we stopped hearg about  - why?
This book is a great book  the Harry Potter series If you loved the first books you will love this one It is excellent There is even me plot  action  this one than the last 3 The bad part is someone dies but i'm not tellg who! You need to read the book It defatly keeps you on your toes
JK Rowlg takes the readto the magical wld of Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire  This book is the fourth  longest  the series   my opion the best  As n all the books the sty begs wh Harry's le  the Dursley household  After beg extremely mistreaed hemoves to his wizardg friend Ron's house where they attend the Quiddch Wld Cup a popular spt  the majical wld  Harry aong wh Ron's family prepare themselves f another school year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  They learn of the new contest the Goblet of Fire  Harry is surprisgly entered after the rules strictly stated he was too young  How  why was he entered?  I suggest readg the book  fdg out f oneself  It's a captivatg book the twists  turns  the plot made me unable to put  down  This book is the best of the series because  gives a better lok to the Magical Wld durg Harry's stay wh Ron's family the Weaseleys  This would be a great book f anyone who likes fantasy  a grippg plot
JK Rowlg is a Master at weavg her magic  this 4th book is no exception  I have been so impressed wh her abily to captivate me as an adult reader  The combation of her sty tellg character development hum  creation of an nocent imagary wld keeps me fascated  anxious to turn each page  It is such a refreshg change of pace from so much of the entertament wld which highlights murder sex  adultry I have thoughly enjoyed each  every Harry Potter book  can hardly wa f the next  I hate to fish them!
Just kiddg People just don't realize that Harry is growg up  this series The challenges that he faces keep gettg harder  harder I thk this series is wonderful because  encourages kids to read And maybe s somewhat violent  scary at times but honestly would you rather have your kid read  watch violent scary television?
This book is really the best  the series Sure there's a lot of detail but the purpose is so that you can get a firm picture of what's gog on  your head I love fantasy sties  I never imaged beg able to read one this good I really can't wa f the next books to come because I'm absolutely sure that they will get better  better as we go along  sce this one was so good I know the next one will be credible!
this is the best book  the seriesI've read  2 times (well 1  a half cause I lost the book) I hope number five is thouss of pages longthe longer the better once you start you cant stop read '
The first three books were fun  charmg I can see why there was so much hype  anticipation f the fourth book What happened? Puttg aside the hrible edg job which resulted  potless overused dialogue danglg sub-plots etc - the tone of the Harry Potter series has left the realm of children's books I am  my 30s  I found &quotthe death&quot to be one of the cruelest thgs I've ever read - not even takg to account that this book is aimed f people 9-12! I don't see how the auth can recapture the tone set  the first three books after the very dark turn the sty has taken It's like all along we've been suckg on this delicious lollipop only to fd that the center is not very tasty at all A very disturbg book
The 4th books  this series is wonderful imagenative  even a ltle thought-provokg The &quotMad-eye&quot end was suprisg  made this book a page-turner And to people who say this needed to be shter I say &quotIf six-year-olds can read  why can't you?&quot I loved the volume of  because I was gettg tired of my fave fantasy books beg only 100 pages long The only bad thg about  was end where Voldemt seems to w I hope this will be rectafied  the next book It is still a defate must-read
This has got to be one of my most fave books of all time I thk the HP books are gettg better  better (Not to dis the first book of course!) If you like action hum spts romance  a great book this one is f you!!! If you haven't read  yet FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE READ IT!!!!!
This book is the best of the series so far All of the Harry Potter books are amazg  they all have a very smooth transion from one to the other which is what keeps the reader hooked I bought the Goblet of Fire when  first came out   was the last copy that the bookste had!!! This book is just fantastic there are so many wds to describe  The emotions  this book are so well wrten that you feel the anger the pa the happess  the srows of all of the people  the book Especially at the end of the tournament when Ld Voldemt turns to a real fce to be reckoned wh  Cedric is killed I felt Cedric's parents pa when Harry took Cedric's body back home I thk that was the most saddest part of the whole Harry Potter series  the most well wrten I believe The way that Ms Rowlg potrayed that whole cident was so realistic that I felt I was gog through the whole thg first h that I was actually  the book! I would recommend this book to everyone I know regardless of what their age group is though I myself am much older than the age group this book was wrten f but this is one series that can be loved by people of all ages
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire by J K Rowlg is completely rivetg You can get lost side another wld  you will never want to come back It is truly a magical experience When you read  you wer to a whole new universe where you do not have to thk about your problems  troubles You can feel what  is like to be a young wizard  exple so many new possibilies It is imagative yet educational at the same time You can discover new wds  learn what to do when your best friend becomes jealous  rude It is whout a doubt the best Harry Potter book that J K Rowlg has wrten so far It is completely enchantg  captivatg It makes  seem like anythg is possible even magic I could read  over  over aga  never get tired of  It teaches readers to be proud st up f themselves  feel sympathy towards others Harry Potter makes children enjoy readg me   is even good f adults It is defely a book f the whole family
I read this book to my 8-year old son   took us 7 months! The sty is fascatg  enjoyable as are the other Harry Potter books but  you're gog to read to your child I recommend numbers 1 to 3  This book was 734 pages  when you read only 5  10 pages a night you feel like nothg has happened! In my opion Ms Rowlg has used far too much detail such as explag how the wches  wizards get to the Quiddch Wld Cup via a ptkey This fmation was imptant later but surely not  such depth We read the climax twice because Harry relates   detail to Dumblede Many of the conversations were also lengthy whout buildg plot The sty got to be very complicated  some of the vocabulary was also dficult f my 8-year-old to underst (His fave is Harry Potter Nr 3) It all adds up to a fascatg sty padded to an unnecessarily long book
I believe that this book is excellent because JK Rowlg displays a wonderful example of freedom of speech this book gives people a view on what ia a prized piece of lurature  a model f fantasy This book has educational value because  demonstrates crect fmat  although no religious concepts tackled right off enriches young children to young adults mds wh readg skills as well as proper use of mechanics
One of the best books ever wrten (my pot of view only)  All four novels are defe wks of art  They all will be remembered  many years to come  Jumpg on the Harry Potter bwagon pretty late I'm well read  most well known auths  also lesser lights too  But I can say wh much honesty that this book is one of the best ever wrten  It triggers emotions of all sts from humour to great saddness  And  does this  me  is wrten  the most simple fashion that  can be read on  on whout any real need f bra stra  Aimed at children but can be read by all ages This book is a must f all
I believed that book three was pivotal however after readg 4 I st crected  It was defelty  terestg twist wh Cedric Diggy dyg  I still thk that  the end Profess Snape will turncoat  I hope somewhere down the le Dudley Dursley looses wa  his parents get some kd of rude awakeng f the mistreatment of Harry  I am eagerly anticipatg Book 5
It's time f Harry to move up to some new technology  prove that his power is versatile  broom-platfm dependent  It's time to start flyg motcycles around  Or snowmobiles  The broom is only emblematic of a static view of Old English wchcraft  I hope this auth can shake Harry out of the broom paradigm particularly sce the broom is also suggestive of gender confusion on his part  Maj le conflict awas yound Harry  I'll have to learn all about  sce I'm stuck readg  conversg  Talmudic detail wh my daughter on this seemgly exhasutible topic
Ms Rowlg sure knows how to capture an audience She lures you  wh a problem then builds  up until you thk there's no me But wa! Look at this 's an unexpected turn Get used to  This book is loaded wh them There is always some way  which all four books are connected From Hermione  Vikt Krum together to Harry's Triwizard Tournament this book will make you want to read all 700+ pages at once Enjoy  while you can because a new one will be out sooner than you thk
the book is the best because  is creative  lets us kids live what Harry is livg  lets us be magicians  lets us underst the Why of wrg  readg It isn't like the books that are bg  wich nothg happens until you reach the climax  is the kd of book  wich you underst what is happeng  thk of ideas to herlp escape Flich  Voldemt Ever scce I read the books I have had new ideas f my wrg essays  my wrg   have improved alot becausre I now have the chance to underst what JK Rowlg is thkg when she was wrg the book   my md the ideas are fmed  the action is unbeleveable because I get the chance to like what I am readg I personaly have read each one twice  am readg the first one f the third time  I always thk I am the one wriong the book  believe I am just downloadg my ideas  the book is just fmg  my md The book is the best book  the wldI recomend  to every personSe los recomiendo es lo maximo I have read many othere books too  believe me they are nothg compared to Harry Potter books  once you've read them you will see what I mean I can't wa f books 56  7 Congratulations JK Rowlg you are thebest wrer there is  your imagation is like a kids md that lets anythg he sees be fmed wyh new characteristics  creative  teachable wds f us to not only underst but also learn I am  very proud of my english  my French is gettg better but the books open the gates to creativy  let me say thet  all the books  the wld were as good as this one I would change a TV f a library card any time But  you buy this book you will have the power to take your childs md away from TV  me to fantasy Believe you should buy the book
Book is just brilliant!!! Although  was rather thick (over 700 pages) I read   2 days!!! Can you image? I just couldn't stop readg I missed the school just because I spend all day readg ! If you buy  you will not regret  that's f sure!! Trust me!!! I am really lookg fward to get the next Harry's adventures! I wanna know how  will end  how  is gog to be  his next school year!!! SO DO NOT HESITATE - JUST BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is que possibly the best book ever wrten let alone the best so far of this series  Don't get me wrong the other three books get five stars as well but this one leaves you on the edge of your seat wantg me  The addional length flies by  gives a me -depth look at Harry  This is by far my fave book of the series at least until the next one comes out
What a great book  Will hold children's attentions AND trigue adults  If you haven't read all of the books  this magnicent series please do so NOW Thank you!
I commute 2 hours a day  listeng to Harry Potter has been a God send  This latest release &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is by far the best book to date I can't wa f the next book Harrys best adventure yet Ron Hermone  Haggard are still helpg Harry out  I miss the Illustrations by just gettg the books on tape but the reader misses Jim Daily's excellent sty tellg He can do magic wh your imagation
I have read all the books about 20 times  was suprised at Jk Rowlg's lack of a ma plot  this book All the other books  a very suspenseful atmosphere  a big twist where as this book focused maly on the triwizard compion  Harry startg to like girls The end was great but f many people the dark endg was a b disturbg because  feshadows that the upcomg books may not be the happy  fantastic wld of magic that entranced so many people  the first book Despe the flaws  this book  is defetly better than any other book i have ever read apart from the rest of the harry potter series this book has plot just not the kd that is usually seen  Jk Rowlg's books
The Goblet of Fire is one of the best books that I have ever read I'm not a child but a 36 year old woman I thk that this book allows one to exple thier own imagations through the characters F me  actually helped wh my depression The book contas a lot of suspense  suprises  was always a thrill to read what was gog to happen next I was so pleased wh this book that I bought my nieces  nephews Harry Potter books of thier own One of my nephews actually got extra cred f brgg his to school We also have discussions about the book This book is a must have f any child's book collection
`The Goblet of Fire' is book 4  the Harry Potter series by J K Rowlg  It is also the largest book to date  this series  To fully appreciate this one you simply must read the precedg three  Book 4 takes a completely dferent turn from the first three wh an entirely unconventional year at Hogwarts  In this book Harry Potter get exposed  a big way to the ternational wld of wizardry by first attendg the `Quiddch Wld Cup'  later becomg a part of a very excg  secret competion between two other wizardg schools like Hogwarts  The characters from precedg books are  full swg  this one  as usual JK Rowlg troduces even me colful  excg characters  this edion  Addionally there is the alarmg return of the frighteng 'He who must not be named'  There is nothg que like the imagation of this auth  is simply wonderful  brilliant  She really has an credible gt f capturg the reader  the most unusual  excg adventures  This book has kd of a dark  scary endg unlike the precedg three  All the same however   sets up the reader wh screamg curiosy f the fth-comg book 5  You will simply enjoy this one as the whole sty broadens out to become a huge global adventure  Harry Potter is the ultimate hero  This series has a unique way of spanng the generations of readers  anyone lookg f somethg fun  entertag to read should defely dig to this series  You will fd yourself captured like none other wh this imagative  refreshg creation  Further the illustrations by Mary Grpre are just right throughout the book to keep you turng page after page  The biggest problem wh this book is that  leaves you ravenously wantg to read book 5   has not been released yet!  A remarkable sty   has me totally captured!  You will simply love !
Take Tolke's gt  wrg add a dash of Roald Dahl's humour  the enthrallg use of wds by Louise Cooper  u get JK Rowlg Out of the series my favoure is Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire gog back to Hogwarts a series of adventures  danger once aga follow Harry like a curse Now wh double the pages comes double the adventure I really loved   I don't know how some people hate  Harry Potter rulez but I don't thk the idea f a movie was good  spoils the imagation that we conjure up each time we read the book
I've heard a lot of cricism about JK Rowlg's books but I must say that anythg that keeps children readg  not watchg television has got to be good  In the US we constantly see articles about declg leracy rates  the amount of television that an average child watches durg the day  I am ecstatic to see the response from Rowlg's books  I am 20 years old  I have read books one through four twice  And just thkg about Harry Ron  Hermione makes me want to read them a third time  I'm not the only one eher  My 56 year old father also enjoys them  He says that they remd him of "The Hobb" series by JRR Tolkien fun  imagative And they are just that fantasy  fun!The thought of anyone thkg that these books somehow condone occults  Satan seems absolutely ludacrist  I've always been an avid reader but these books are just too temptg to pass up  And I don't mean temptg by the way of SatanIf we really want to "save" our children from the devil  all other sts of evil that some people thk are associated wh these books let's focus on the people that raise the children not an auth tryg to make children happy  Just thk about  JK Rowlg didn't have to contue wh the third  fourth book  she didn't want to  So many books were bought wh the first  second edions that she could have been set f le  But stead she chose to do somethg that made her  millions of other people  the wld happy  She contued to make us laugh wh these booksI've heard so many sties about parents readg these books to their children stead of watchg a TV program together  Now what do you thk that a child will remember me stg together  silence watchg a rerun of Sabra  a delightful half-hour of readg wh their Mom  Dad?  I thk that anyone who has read these books knows the answer to thatI'd suggest these books to anyone whether you can read them  two days  two years these books are just too good to missher you can read them  two days  two years these books are just too good to miss
Fast spaced action f hero  his friends nothg is ever easy n is  simple  Each cner has a new twist  unexpected challenge f Harry  wh each turn you fd the friends ga knowledge understg  experience
At over 700 pages Rowlgs latest stallment of the Harry Potter saga could have used some judicious edg Includg almost every character troduced so far  a slew of new ones this book just has too much gog on From the Quiddch Wld Cup to the Tri-Wizard tournament this book bounces from one maj event to another wh ltle of the character development that Rowlg has become justly known f Me trouble f Hagrid me problems wh Snape  red herrgs abound  this massive tome The most compellg aspect of this novel is the understg that Voldemt's evil is a powerful one  manests self hribly  the climax of this tale  remds the reader that all is not laughs  good times f Hogwart's most famous student Hopefully Rowlg will get back on track wh the next stallment Sometimes less is me
Yes I liked the book as the other three  I read   a couple of days but I have to say (sry to the other fans) that 's not as good as the previous books It's twice as long as the others which could not be a problem but Mrs Rowlg felt that she had to add new messages to the tale such as the freedom of the po elves caught  a slavery sistem by the magiciams themselves  other allusions about human equaly that appeals to me like cheap maly  Besides the &quotsurprise effect&quot (wh the addg of new characters  elements) tends to be a route that wh every new part of the saga is gettg me  me complicated to justy Other than that 's terestg (This review is based on the spanish translation of the book)
Wh all of the hype surroundg Harry Potter I would bet that many people will pass over these books as nothg me than a fad That would be unftunate  I was one of the people who bought them on a whim I was takg a friend of me to the Atlanta airpt when I noticed &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot on the shelf at a bookste Knowg that they would fly off the shelves  I didn't grab a copy (I had heard about the book on the news that eveng) I bought a copy Not only that but I bought a copy of each of them (I'm one of those people who  the heat of the moment believes that  I don't get one now I'll never be able to!)I decided I would give them to my 8 year old niece f Christmas Now I heard the sties about how &quotevil&quot the books were supposed to be so I decided to read the first one - just to see I was HOOKEDI read all the books the week I bought them I gave my niece a card  $2000 f ChristmasSure these books may be the epome of mass market publication And you might get sick of seeg Harry Potter everywhere But when  comes down to  the books are good Igne the trkets the bookends posters glasses stuffed animals  all the hype Buy the books take  from this 30+ year old kid - they are every b as enjoyable as they are made out to be
After readg all three of the previous Harry Potter books  sequence I fally arrived to this one The Goblet of Fire  Although a b timidated by s enmous size I was determed to tackle this novel as well thus endg my Harry Potter experience (f the time beg)  I whizzed through The Goblet of Fire due to s enthrallg plot  explosive action  JK Rowlg contued to amaze me wh her credible creativy  imagation by cludg Harry  events such as the famous Triwizard Tournament  yet another encounter wh &quotHe Who Must Not Be Named&quot  As impressed as I was wh The Goblet of Fire I must adm that my fave of the tremendous four book series was the first one  These great fantasy adventure books are defately dested to become classics!!!
I must adm I am addictedIts like ciggaretts once you start you cant stop I am eighteen  embarressed to adm  but I read the whole series not once but twice  enjoyed  thoughly I dont care who you are  how cool you thk you are  you read this book you wont feel as  your time has been wasted It is a wonderful sequel to the series servg  justice
Harry Potter books are the clearly the best f people who are terested  mystery magic  scerers The Goblet of Fire is the last sequel of the Harry Potter books  to get an idea of the whole experience you must read the first three books In the sequels you really get to the action I recomend these books to anybody who loves to use their imagation!
Harry potter  the goblet of fire gives me than u got from any of the other books  has a great plot  u'll love the tournament so read 
JK Rowlg has created another magical sty this time wh the fabled Goblet of Fire  This fourth book  the Harry Potter series is  my opion the best  Harry Hermoe  Todd get to all kds of amazg suations  &quotYou Know Who&quot makes his biggest attempt to kill Harry  At first this book looked a ltle timidatg weighg  at over 700 pages but I loved  all  read   less than a week  Adults  children alike can enjoy Rowlg's wrgs  should not be scared off by the lenght  suject matter  The magic of this series is why the fth book is so anticipated  Don't be afraid to start on any book they are designed so that anyone can start a book  not be lost  You don't have to read them  der even though  will make  me fun  So people of all ages get this book you will not be disappoted!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is by far the best-- most thought-provokg-- the series  While  starts off  typical zany fashion as the Weasleys fetch Harry to attend the Quiddch Wld Cup fals complete wh strange travelg arrangements  spells gale the book quickly veers to me turbulent waters as the Wld Cup gatherg is terried by the sightg of the Dark Mark not seen sce the dreaded Ld Voldemt stalked the wizardg wld  To further complicate matters Harry is explicably chosen to compete  the Triwizard Tournament held between Hogwarts  two other wizardg schools  fds himself contendg wh much me than he expectedOlder kids  Harry's many adult fans will fd &quotGoblet of Fire&quot to be compellg readg  This is by far the darkest book  the series wh some extradarily chillg scenes (yes there's even some bloodshed)  Parents of younger Harry Potter fans may want to take a look through the book befe passg  on--there is some mild profany (the d-wd  the h-wd)  suations that may confuse  frighten ltle ones particularly towards the end  The length (734 pages) may also be timidatg f some kids  JK Rowlg however is developg to an amazg fantasy wrer  She is obviously aware of Harry's maturg audience  each book is a ltle me complex a ltle deeper-- ultimately better than the last
This was most defately the best book i have ever read  my le  I thought  was way over rated but I was wrong  The new tri-wizard tournament is very cool deed especially the last task!  This is certian buy f everyone 11 to 111  I would have given this 999999999 billion stars but I couldent!  :-(
This book is GREAT  Like the other three books the real bad guy who's stirrg thgs up this time at Hogwarts is once aga a SURPRISE  Around the second third of the book everythg turns serious  all of Harry's daily le challenges seem less than trivial  This makes this book have me weight than the others  i thk i am by no means the only one to stay up all night to see what happens  This book draws you deeper to the wizardg wld  seems that Harry is almost all but losg his ties to the muggle wld  Even so he is STILL after 4 years havg revelations about the wizard wld  Good thg he has Ron f a friend does he?  There are about 4  5 dferent mysteries gog on  this one some small some huge (the Goblet of Fire one comg to md)  Hermione's character is refced  this one her brilliance  loyalty are a big help to Harry  Harry isn't the only person to notice her good qualies  If you have read the other books I'm SURE you can't wa to fd out what happens wh Sirius Snape ChoRich  plot suspensful colful characters (each wh their dferent side--McGonagall strict yet soft Dumblede powerful yet humous Snape &quotevil&quot yetwell there's one mystery that's gonna have to wa f the next book--)  please read  me than once  You'll fd ltle thgs feshadowg that makes you say &quotOH!&quot  Thgs that made sense befe will have a whole dferent meang the second time don't be timidated by the lengthIf anythg  should be longer!!!!!
I found this book great but  kd of missed some action While  had a great plot  had only 3 great parts one ok  over 700 pages!!! I've read childrens books wh a better action ratio Other than that  was very well put together The way the plot was made you guess 'till the very end I espesially liked the endg because suprises are what I like  a good book
The Goblet of Fire is a magnicent book f several reasons  First Ms Rowlg constantly rewards the reader who has read the other three books by mentiong details ( then reeratg the details) from the other books  addg me complexies to the various nuggets of fmation  Second although book starts off a b slower than the other three noevels this is due to the richer  me complicated sty le (as compared to the other three novels)  The me sophisticated sty le should please adult readers as the plot is me complex  eventually far scarier than the other three novels  Don't miss this book!  (I'm 34 - no one is too old to read these books!)
Rowlg at her spfiest! I was extremely happy to fd out this book was over 700 pages because I'm a fast reader&quotGoblet of Fire&quot took four hours to read but of course I read  over  over aga The only problem wh a 700-page hardcover book is  can be dficult to hold  the bathtub (Don't ask) JK is best at the ltle details that make Harry Potter books so fun to readBertie Bott's Every Flav Beans  the mysterious  amusg attractg powers of the veela f example Now I have to twiddle my fgers  anticipation of the next stallment which I know will shatter s own recd f books published To bide your time I suggest the schoolbooks JK wrote f Comic Relief especially &quotFantastic Beasts  Where to Fd Them&quot which cludes a description of the Puffske a sweet  cuddly child's pet who enjoys eatg boogers
I am very sure that JK Rowlg could have expressed everythg that this book needs  put  about 100  200 less pages It still has a lot of plots  adventures wh the multi school tournament  the whole fight wh Voldemt aga I thk he should die  the next book I am kd of tired about readg about people sayg you know who  he is so scary  the book It is just bg I did like the idea of Harry beg magicaly put to the tournament by some fce that put his name to the Goblet of fire It was hard to put down because you just had to know what amazg catastrophe that Harry can save the day at I bet that Harry  that girl that was also  the tourmnament are gog to marry at the end of the series Who knows? I need a good read some time so I am lookg fward to JK Rowlg to come out wh her book some time :)
This is certaly the best Harry Potter book of all of them Harry is the best quiddch player I would recomend this book to anyone  evryone So go to your nearest bookste  but  because I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN because  is so good
This book is very well wrten  It adds comdy suspense action  much me  It is about a boy who discovers he is a wizard  He goes to a school called Hogwarts  This is a special school f wizards  wches  Harry is extremely glad f this school sce he lives wh his aunt  uncle  His parents were killed by an evil wizard  Harry's aunt  uncle are very mean to Harry  treat their son Dudley much better  spoil him  But sce Harry started learng magic his family were afraid f their lives  At school Harry was chosen f a tournament  Even though there are only suppose to be three champions Harry was chosen by the Goblet of Fire to be the fourth  Gog the through the challenges he discovers that someone wants him dead  He survives the first two events but at the end of his third Harry is transpted to a far away place  The evil wizard who killed Harry's parents planned the transptation so he could fally kill Harry  But to fd out what happens you are gog to need to read the book
Wds cannot convey the genius of The Goblet of Fire Wh every addion to the Harry Potter series JK Rowlg outdoes herself I don't know how she can top this magnicent wk but I'm eager to fd out The Goblet of Fire has become one of my fave books even though I'm 17 I fished this book  2 days because I just couldn't put  down Every page was better than the last Harry Potter is f people of all ages The plots are so tricate  captivatg All I have to say is read this book  you won't be disappoted I've read  over  over aga  the wa f the 5th book is drivg me crazy but I'm sure 'll be wth the wa
Harry's gettg older that's f sure The first page of this book absolutely will give you a shock It's DIFFERENT Our wizard had to deal not only wh a mean teacher pile of homewks  quiddch trag But here  this book he had to deal wh a confusion of gettg a girl f the Ball face a gigantic dragon love triangle lack of friends  respect  the Ld Voldemt himself I assure you you can't possibly put this one down  had to read  aga  aga even  you don't want to Another superb wk of MsRowlg10 thumbs up!
i started readg the harry potter series about a month ago well i could not stop readg the books! i was completly adictied to them but when i saw how big the 4th book was i was discouraged i never liked readg thick books wh the excuse that  would last fever to read them i have read harry potter  the golblet of fire  3 days!!!!!!!!!  eventhough the action is kda long to get started the book get unbearably excg at the end  you just won't want to stop readg  to my opion this is the best book  the serie so far  is a book i recommend to anyone whether adult  not now i can't wa f the 5th book to come out i can't even believe i have re-read the serie 8 times!!!!!!!!!!  who cares  the books are f children 9-12! i'm 14  that doesn't mean i can't enjoy readg the books too!
Nmally when somethg is as publicized as this book was  can disappot  not live up to expectations 'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' is a defe exception to this rule The one thg f me that makes the whole series phenomenon so good is the way that all the books are terlked together so cleverly I don't mean that the characters reappear  each novel although this is obviously true What I'm talkg about is the way  you read each book  the series you will notice many ltle details mentioned earlier on sprg up at later pots  the books As an example I give the fact that  book 1 when Harry goes to buy his w he is told that his father James's w was excellent f transfiguration In book three we learn that Harry's father was an animagus somethg that requires expertize  transfiguration There are many other details like this which you will notice  you reread the series Book four the Goblet of Fire  particular is an excellent piece of modern lerature Aside from the cool ltle references back to earlier books the best part of this novel is the tense drama  fear that JK Rowlg expresses   me so than has appeared  the first three books Many people seem to dismiss the Harry Potter books as 'just f kids' but I can assure you that they can be enjoyed equally by adults on a dferent level While kids may like the magic  excement adults will enjoy the complexy of the plot  the lks which I mentioned earlier on I have yet to meet a sgle person young  old male  female who has read this book  not enjoyed  F those who believe that Harry Potter is anti-Christian I urge you to read the series befe makg this judgement  you will see that underneath the surface of wches  wizards lie strong Christian mals Fgive me is I'm wrong but I thk that Albus Dumblede the prcipal of Harry's school is supposed to be a metaph f Jesus  that the loss of the 'Elixir of le'  book one is the symbol of his mtaly Although I'm reviewg 'The Goblet of Fire' I recommend that you read the previous three books first to get full enjoyment of the series However havg said that this book can equally st alone The only m quibble I have wh this book is the fact that due to s length  take que a while to get started  the English edion of the book there are around 150 pages of scene settg befe Harry even arrives at school However all these pages are hugely relevant to the plot  necessary f this sty This really doesn't detract from the qualy of the book a great deal   is still hugely enjoyable despe this All that is left to say is roll on book 5!!!!of the 'Elixir of le'  book one is the symbol of his mtaly Although I'm reviewg 'The Goblet of Fire' I recommend that you read the previous three books first to get full enjoyment of the series However havg said that this book can equally st alone The only m quibble I have wh this book is the fact that due to s length  take que a while to get started  the English edion of the book there are around 150 pages of scene settg befe Harry even arrives at school However all these pages are hugely relevant to the plot  necessary f this sty This really doesn't detract from the qualy of the book a great deal   is still hugely enjoyable despe this All that is left to say is roll on book 5!!!!
this book was great of the whole series number 3 was the best but this comes  a close seconedharry is growg up  this book he has a crush on a girl over coures there the usall dangers to over come also a bunch of other miadvrentures are throw 
Over the summer I was fced to read this series I thaught that  would be pretty dumb sce I'm  highschool I loved  In the first 3 books Harry survived by luck but now he's growg to a young man The book is full of suspense action  once i started readg  i couldn't put  down This series just gets better every bookI cant wa f book 5
Me violent  probably a b scarier than the first three  the series this was still a good book to read I do thk  was better than most long adult level books some of those could be cut  half whout losg much of value So many people these days whether child  adult can't be bothered to read anythg wh such length  sure is good to fd somethg so many will read
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a very terestg book that you will never give up readg  It had caught my attention  the first few pages that I read  the begng eventhough the whole book has seven hundred  thirty four pages total  This book really set up a part of delight  hric images  every page  Sometimes the book got very dreadful sce the chapters were so long but still  has lots of twists  turns   that makes you want to read on no matter what  But no matter what anybody thks I thk  deserves a 4  This book rocks!
This is a sty about a young boy named Harry Potter who attends  is  his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Widardry  His le long enemy Voldemt is planng to kill Harry f revenge  Voldemt has been plottg this revenge f 13 years  This fourth sequel  this spectacular series is a must read  I especially like Harry's fave spt Quidch which he has had natural talent  sce his very first time on a broomstick  The one drawback to this book is 's great length  It can become tiresome  wag f the plot to unfold  I recommend this book to people ages 10  older  A Middle School student would enjoy  greatly  Also teachers will fd this book has good readg qualies  lots of plot potential  I would recommend this book to others  thk highly of this entire series

As a parent I highly recommend this series f those who want to encourage readg  imagation  their children
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire what an awesome book! The fourth stallment fds our hero at the Quiddch Wld Cup  then back to Hogwarts f his fourth year! The Triwizard Tournament is beg held at the school this year  everybody's all exced until Prof Dumblede restricts the entries to students older than seventeen On the night they pick the name the Goblet of Fire (they put their names  to enter) picked three  thenmysteriouslywho's name should appear but Harry Potter's?

Just  case you're a parent  want to know what all the fuss is about Harry Potter is a young boy who discovers that he is the pahned son of two well-respected magicians beg raised by dary  brutish relatives Despe what the few crics say all the books discuss self-reliance trust  mal behavi  sound on various themes resonant wh children: loss of a parent superpowers  facg fears wh courage Each book describes the adventures of successive years  a magical boardg school where Harry  his companions are beg structed  magical arts Harry who is kd of shy  modest is an unwtg celebry beacuse of his deceased parents' status - this is me usually a hdrance than helpIn Goblet of Fire Harry is allowed to compete  a contest to determe the wldwide school champion of magic: Harry is one of the youngest ever to be allowed to compete which causes accusations of favism  some bterness from his usually steadfast friends The plot twists keep the reader terested all the way through the book  the endg is a shockerThis book is an excellent progression  this series Don't thk of  as readg a &quotkids' book&quot - Harry Potter can appeal to the misf young adult  us all As an adult  would be easy to dismiss JK Rowlg's excellent  imagative series as another media creation - were  not f the fact that the books appeal to a wide range of ages  spire each reader to use their imagations  read Use these great books as an opptuny to share an enthusiasm wh your kids  fd out how much you'll enjoy yourself!
I thought that Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a kd of a tough book because you had to read a lot of magic wds  A book like this is not read by a lot of kids  my third grade class because wd passed that  was not a good book  was stupid but I thk someone could not have fun readg  so he decided that he would not let anyone else have fun readg  I have read all four books  just could not put the four books down so  you want a good book read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  It is about a boy named Harry Potter who goes to a castle called Hogwarts  he gets romly picked f a Tournament called the Triwizard Tournament but who put his name  the Goblet?  Read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire to learn me!note:Read the first book first then the second then the third then the fourthBY JK Rowlg  Illustrat is Mary Grpre
I've been lookg f a series of books like this particular set ever sce CS Lewis's &quotChronicles of Narnia&quotThat's what? A period of over 10 years? Yeah 's been awhile Ohh I was a skeptic first (Harry who?) until I browed &quotScerer's Stone&quot from a fellow freshman I'm a changed personThe fourth book is a culmation of excement emotion  just pla fervent page turng readg Wd of caution - read the first three  you'll never get through this book alive ( why would you want to?Half the fun is beg immersed totally  this alternate wld of Rowlg's) It's one of those books that begs a quick sequel - but Rowlg's a hell of a marketer  the fth stallment won't be soon enough  comg f anyone It's amazg - the deadly serious (lerally) problems that Harry encounters  this book are ever so present (nay - crease tenfold is me like )  yet s still the kd of book a child should read  even encourages the adult reader to look at  from perspectives that should be had once  a while (we take thgs way too seriously f our own good after we turn 19)The plot's development tears at the heartstrgs of the reader as the scenes wh Harry's parents the death of a rival  the maturg of Harry  terms of love  courage come  go The mystery of Snape the powers of Dumblede the  hr of the very very changed wld that is presented at the end of the novel is enough to make any follower of this epic just breathe wh amazement at the skill of the auth  creatg a good styBuy the series  you haven't yet Few auths create wlds where we'd want to stay as Rowlg has done This one's a keeper I beg her to release the fth book as soon as possible We Muggles can only take so much after all

I've read so-called best sellers that do not reach up to her ankles The sty is engagg  entertag   you are too sophisticated to be able to take a ltle predictabily then 's your bad luck How realistic  &quotbelievable&quot do want a book to be? This is supposed to be an escape from realy not a repetion of your day at wkAs to the endg  you are one of those over-protective parents who attempt to screen their kids from anythg BAD you might want to read this first As far as I'm concerned a ltle violence  a book doesn't hurt As a child I've always reveled  a direct threat to the ma character I wanted to be SCARED It made my stomach tgle And guess what? I'm not out there shootg up school classrooms I have que lerally never hurt a fly  I thk we're too wried about what kd of example books  media give to our children THEY DON'T - WE AS THE PARENTS DO The media are meant as entertament  release  as long as we are our kids' role models that is all they will beRead on Just f the fun of  Don't play the cric just enjoy 
I'm 20 years old  I've just been troduced to Harry Potter  his wonderful friends  I can't believe  took me this long to take the advice of my friends  read JK Rowlg's books  They are the best books I have ever had the pleasure of readg  I bought all four  hardback  I read them  two days  These books are addictg  I thk Goblet of Fire is the best so far  I can't wa f the fth  the series  I've become a diehard fan  I love these books!
i really thk that anyone who enjoys readg can enjoy these books I heard all the commotion about the series when  started  i really didnt thk much about  but now that i have read this- i am gog to have to read the others Its a very volvg sty  i wish they would stop marketg  just to children  younger kids because i really believe  is me age nuetral than most people would thk There is a good mix of language   content that kids can learn from possibly but also language that can be comprehended  understood me competently by those slightly older readers anyway s a good book  defiely one that youll fd yourself stuck to your chair f-  once you fish  you'll be wag f the sequel (as I am now)
The fourth book out of four  the magnicent Harry Potter series is great!  It kept me on the edge of my seat  did not want to put the book down lterally  By far the best book that I have ever read  I can not wa untill the fth book comes out  I hope  is soon  Nothg bad to say about this book only spectacular  marvelous thgs about this fantasy that keeps youy on the edge of your seatI suggest you read the first three books befe readg the fourthIt all begs when Harry is wh his Uncle Aunt  annoyg fat cous  It is almost time to return to Hogwarts the school of wch craft  Harry gets owls (his way of communicatg wh friends) from his pals who have tickets to the Quiddch CupFrom there on this great sty just seems to get better  betterI will leave you to fd out what happens after the Quiddch cupGood Luck  Happy Readg!
I come from a Christian family  we have no problem wh Harry Potter at all It really all depends on  you have problems wh your children readg about wchcraft  wizardry Children should have no trouble determg what is good  what is evil The first 3 books are great as far as I am concerned f any child that can read However the fourth book does get violent  darker than the other books I would not recommend  to any child younger than 13 The thg that's bad about troducg the books to children when they are 7  8 years old is that they will zoom through the first 3  want to get their hs on the 4th one The Harry Potter books are great  I highly recommend them Adults will love them too! I am 30  I absolutely love them! My children are still too young but I plan to let them read them as soon as I thk they are ready
As an aspirg wrer ( as a grown up wh a grown up daughter) I bought book 1 to see what all the fuss was about  Well I was simply enthalled from page 1  promptly bought books 2-4  I read day  night until fished enjoyg each book me than the lastSimply put the law of averages is agast Rowlg pleasg everyone but I can see why *practically* everyone is as enthalled as I am  In an era of &quotstream of consciousness&quot &quothow-to&quot  &quottell-all&quot memis Rowlg has concocted a delightful STORY!!The wld Rowlg created f Harry is astoundg   believable  Everythg fs from the flyg brooms to wizard education to spts to dragons  How imagative  And an adult readg these books can look back  remember their first dress-up dance (hled very well by Rowlg  book 4)  remember school mates just like Harry  his classmates  Doubtless they will also take a moment  two to image grown up versions of those classmates  f those they no longer know will wonder  they lived up to ( down to) their potential  And of course we all like a good vs evil sty after all &quot    decent people are so easy to manipulate   &quot (Book 4) but they w  the end don't they?Each book covers a year  Harry's le  One might thk this would get bg  Not so  The plot of each book is que dferent  builds up  suspense until the surprisg end  Each book is also better than the last  There is polics hum sadness fantasy  a poison pen repter (another imagative wonder)  these books  Rowlg  Harry Potter has boys  girls ( adults) readg aga  That alone is wth 5 stars!!
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series takes a serious turn from the previous Scerer's Stone Chamber of Secrets  Prisoner of Azkaban I like the way Ms Rowlg is addg a darker tone as opposed to the cheerful begng set  the first three There are moments of sheer terr but  makes the sty tellg excg  unfgettable   As I read the Goblet of Fire I began to notice the set up f the fal three books that will conclude the series I throughly enjoyed readg the Goblet of Fire f a neteen year old that's que a surprise I'm lookg fward to book five the Order of the Phoenix as we can tell that the sty will surpass any predictions about s plot
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a very trigug book wh many well thought out characters  Th plot is amazg wh many twist  turns to leave you gaspg f me  This is truly a masterpiece  One of the best fantasy novels sce the Ld of the Rgs  The plot combes all the maj aspects of a wonderful novel  to one such as:  action fantasy mystery suspence betrayal hr  almost every other aspect you can imaje  The book starts wh The Qutich Wld Cup  Somethg very strange happens there  The dark mark is cast!  The dark mark is the sign of "you know who"  this time he may be back!  It is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts  there is a very special activy planned volvg three ancient wizardog schools that hasn't happened f centuries  The Triwizard Tournament  Do these strange accurances have anythg  common?  Is this some master plot to kill Harry?  The only way your gog to fd out is  you go  read   If you havent read the first three yet turn of your computer right now  go get them!!!  Other wise der this book asap!!!
This is a good book no doubt However I felt that the book could have been eded down a ltle b Rowlg spends a good ption of the early part of book just messg around wh ltle subplots that don't come to anythg at the end I felt that while the sty was engagg as  the other books wh a ltle edg this book could have been the best  the series
Harry Potter  the goblet of fire is a very excg  unpredictable book  Its about an phan boy named Harry Potter who is a wizard  He was sent to live wh his aunt  uncle who want nothg to do wh him  His parents were killed by the evil Ld Voldemt who tried to kill him as a baby but the spell backfired  Harry became a household name  Now he is gog back to the wizard school (Hogwarts) to his friends Hermione Granger  Ron Weasley  Hermione is a very smart girl who is always at the top of her class  Ron is a very po boy wh many brothers  Now Harry is off to another year of mischief  excement
Passwd: Caput Draconi:) I must confess that the fourth book of the series is the only that I have not read yet but I have no doubt that  is as fantastic as the first three My country has only published the first one because the rest have not been translated yet  books  English are practically unavailable here I found  some bookshop a rather terrible (as to the qualy) edions of the second  the third book but there was no fourth  they said there won't be eher I could of course have that through Internet but unftunately the prices there are sry to say not available f a country where the best students'scholarship does not exceed 15 dollars  So I wre  a pledge: has anyone  the wide wide wld (www:) got a spare copy of the fourth book that he/she could share wh me? There are such a great number of edions you f stance have decided to buy a new collects'edion of the book  throw out your old one please don't do  f there is a po Potterfan far  the Eastern Europe that longs to read ! If you could help me  one  another way I would be most thankful You can email me to the followg address: gilda_ri@yahoocom Happy Potterreadg to all!
The readg level f this book is 9-12 but don't let that put you off of this creative series The media is gushg about these books but don't let that put you off There's a movie comg out but don't let that put you off If you haven't read this books you're obviously missg somethg This book (The series fact) has somethg f everyone Mische  Fun f the younger ones  themes only adults will pick up on Unfgettable characters plots  images will float to your conversations (&quotyeah she's a Hermione Granger all right)  this will be a fulproof way to connect wh your children neices grchildren so on overall  almost everyone who picks up the books like them won't you too?
This is an awesome book Harry has another counter wh Voldemt  meets his parents (st of) If you look there is a mistake  the of book James comes out befe Lily! Do not be fooled  isn't a plot twist!!
My fiancee  I started readg Harry Potter  the sprg of 2000  we have read all four books  We've done so  an unusual manner -- I read them aloud to her ( started when she had a severe migrae  her head hurt too badly to let her watch TV  read)  Our readg has followed a pattern: we slowly pick through chapters f the first third of a book as Rowlg gathers all the strgs from the previous books  gets the kids back to Hogwarts then we pick up speed as the plot picks up  We usually read the last third of the book  a day  Goblet of Fire was no dferent  The first third was (f me) the best begng to a Harry Potter book yet  the pace stayed swt from the first page to the last  We read the last 200+ pages  one night fishg around 2am  Wk the next day was not funAbsolutely amazg wrg brilliant characters well thought-out plots tremendous wrten imagery  This is the best book yet -- darker than the previous books but the dficulties faced by Harry  his friends are well constructed  the very sad endg is a powerfully done piece of wrg that speaks volumes about good  evil  It also shows some of the powerful potential wh Harry  what his parents must have been like durg Voldemt's reign  (By the way we now have me reason than ever to say that 's a BAD idea to mess wh Dumblede)  I look fward to book 5
actually i thk this book id one of the best though 's extremly long  It should be easy to read f almost every readg level even f those begg english  Once aga Harry Ron  Hermione take us on another thrillg adventure  Of course  Malfoy Crabbe  Goyle are volved but they take the back seat  this book  It seems that they have no Defence agast Dark Arts teacher  Profess Moody (aka Mad Eye Moody) is just the person to fill the posion  This year the tri-wizard tournament is takg place  so Hogwarts  2 other schools get together at Hogwarts  beg the cerimony  Now usually three names come out of the hat but this time a fourth came out  Of course  had Harry Potter on   Thus Harry must compete wh the others to w the tournament  stay alive but wh voldemt  the backround watchg how long will harry last  This is a very good book that shows how friends must stick together to defeat evil  If you like Harry Potter you might wanna check out stys like Redwall

No matter how many me novels about the now famous Harry Potter are published I feel they will all be judged agast this one Kd of like the FDR of the seriesI st by my earlier reviews of previous Harry Potter books when I wrote that Rowlg wres wh the growg perception of an agg boy In this fourth volume she sees the wld me fully  through older eyes than previously Harry is growg  so is his wldThis is one fe piece of lerature Rowlg sets a stage early  a way remiscent of some of the great hr wrers of the times And this book is less fantasy adventure as  ends up beg hric In one of the longest climactic sequences I've read  ages she unfolds her plot's essence  sets the monsters loose  you just can't help readg  You can't stop And why should you?All the thgs you want to happen  this book actually happen Harry shows hts of his greatness The only thg that happened that I didn't like was that  endedI am contually impressed by the scope of the Harry Potter novels as well as Rowlg's remarkable abily to realize an epic vision But the previous three were complete wh me  less defe closure Not so here This one will have you swimmg the pond  crossg the country  flyg the Edburgh  knockg at Rowlg's do demg book five I underst 's due out  2002
Well here  is folks! Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire This is the Fourth Harry Potter Book  the series  I would say the best! Many people say that the begng was a b slow but those people don't realize how bg the book would be whout ! It sets the stage f the rest of the book wh  Harry's Dream  which he sees Voldemt planng to kill him The Death Eaters returng  makg spt of muggles  the Dark Mark which is mysteriously fired to the sky at the Wld CupNow I have to ask you:  all these strange thg hadn't happened would you be exced of Vikt Krums Arrival? Would you fd anythg wrong wh Bertha Jks disappearance? Would you have even the SLIGHTEST idea who they were talkg about when they said Mad-Eye-Moody? I thk notF all of those people who haven't read the book yet try not too thk thgs like &quotthis is sooo bg&quot  &quotI'm never gog to fish!&quot because J K Rowlg never cludes anythg that dosen't have a purpose  the plot   you thk  is a b bg at the begng then just keep sluggg along until you get past the stuff that was bg you to death f I can ASSURE you that  is very terestg once you get past the openg of the plot  to the school year wh pesky repters Jolly Mistry Members  House Elf protestsI guess all I can say is that whether you thought the begng was good  not there is no question that the bulk of  was funny lively  entertag
I fd the book well wrten The names are great It was a wonderful adventure felt like I was there myself There's magic mystery mayhem all wraped together  a neat packageIt shows the value of true friendshipThgs aren't alway what  seems Once you start you don't want to stop 's addictive readg

The fourth book of the quartet is as magical as the first The wld of Hogwarts  Harry Potter is full of magnicence  magic! I have grown to love Harry Hermione Ron Neville  especially the pranks of Fred  Gege What is so special about the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is that  has an added realism to s wld of flyg brooms giants  gobls Potter is brave  he proves that one just needs a lot of courage determation  resourcefulness to fight evil even   has dark magic  is too powerful He is the hero  every child Still brimmg wh lerary magic  great lessons f children of all ages Harry Potter is a quartet of books I would love to have  my library
Most people would crge at the idea of readg a book over 700 pages long  Yet somehow this book didn't create that effect especially from me a slave to the prted wd  Harry Potter is an ternational phenomenon  this book is no exception  Harry goes to the International Quiddch Championship wh the Weaselys  goes to Hogwarts from there  There he fds out the Quiddch cup had been canceled (don't groan)  Instead they would take part  the Triwizards Tournament  which one wizard each from three dferent wizardg schools: Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang take part  dangerous tests of skill  In der to enter you must be 17  each school gets only one contestant each so naturally Harry is surprised when he gets selected as Hogwarts' second champion!  Ltle does he know that Voldemt is lurkg behd every cner  is slowly gag power
Harry Potter is a 14 year old wizard who attends Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  When he was just  fant he amazgly escaped the wrath of the most feared wizard of all Ld Voldermt  sent him to hidg  Ever sce Voldermt has wanted revengeAt school Harry's best friends are Ron Weasly  Hermoe Granger  This year everyone fds out that a Triwizard tournament is to be held at Hogwarts this year  In this tournament three schools choose one champion who compete agast each other  three tasks  Although the age mimum is 16  only three people can be chosen Harry is somehow picked along wh Cedric Diggy from Hogwarts as well  Each of the four champions have to successfully complete three tasks  der to w  Harry completes the first two tasks wh flyg cols along wh his other opponents  The last task is to navigate through a meerg laberynth  fend off dangerous creatures To fd out what happens  the last task  fd out who is the wner you will have to purchase this book  read  f yourself This book has many shockg twists  turns that make is wthy of my recommendation to anyone of any age  It is an epic tale of adventure  is easy to comprehend  I defately recommend  to anybody who likes to read
All through high school I have hated the books my school assigned  School tought me that readg is bg because there is no such thg as a good book  Although Harry Potter has changed all that  After readg book 1 on a plane outof bdom I was hooked to the series  have each book  The only reason people don't like 's magical aspect is because  is new  There is no me magic  Harry Potter than  Hansel  Gretal  Read this book you will love !!!!!
I'm 14 years old  i can't help readg through these Harry Potter books  2-3 days  Well this one kept me tide over f almost 4-5 days!  I loved this book  all the other Harry Potter books  If you are agast Harry Potter I dare you to read one of them  see  you're still agast !

&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is defely the best book from the Harry Potter series  the best book I ever read J K Rowlg is a genious The book is excg  spellbdg full of hum  not bg f even a moment The plot is me terestg than ever  J K Rowlg cleverly hides hts about the endg which you can only notice the second time your read No matter how much you try you could never guess what's comg next! 743 pages of the most fascanatg fiction I ever read!
In the fourth book of this series Harry is at the Fourth Year  Hoghwart's  not only his classes are gettg me dficult but his le also Compared to the previous books this one is me complex 's full of plots  subplots but that doesn't detract from  In fact  enhances !!! We're troduced to a lot of new characters  keep meetg the old ones Harry is growg up   shows!!!!The endg of this book is great  sad at the same time (probably because le is sad  great at the same time too!!) Some of the facts of Harry's past  future are startg to unravel  the promise of me to come is there f Book 5 A great read Don't miss 
This book is excellent but I felt  left too many loose ends But i am sure these will be tied up  book 5 which sadly won't be out till next year (I thk!)  The Goblet of Fire is great you can not put  down till you have read  all! The endg is so heart wrenchg  Miss Rowlg shows she has the Magic! All I say is buy this book you will like  's as good  not better than the others I can't decide which is my favoure-book 3  this Truely brilliant
Once aga JK Rowlg managed to grab my attention  reta  throughout 700+ pages  Imagation abounds as Harry faces a very challengg  tryg suation  The book was funny wty  ventive  However I was a ltle disappoted wh the sad endg  felt that  was unnecessary  As I'm sure peple would not like f me to reveal the endg  case they have not read the book I will refra from divulgg the endg  Still  cast a slight shadow over the book
This book is full of action  Every where Harry goes there is somethg new poppg up  I give this book a 5 star because  is the bast fiction book I have ever read  ( this does not clude Harry Potter 12 3) I do recommend you go to your bookste  Amazoncom  buy   The people that thk this book is a bad book NO they are just scared that  they read  then  could happen Or they don't believe  magical stuff but  you are like that I recommend that you der this book  give  a chance  Almost  everybody  the US has this novel BUY IT READ IT  is not that hard  And  you don't want to start at book #4 then buy book #1  wk your way up  The first time I started readg these books I was just board  saw a coppy on the back   school  saw a coppy on the back shelf  I started readg   I felt like I had to fish the book that day that is how good  is Good Luck on choosg  I hope I was a help
In July of 2000 this book was first released  I wondered what all the fuss was about As a 40 year old adult I wondered who on earth is Harry Potter? My curiosy piqued I picked up the paper copy of Book 1  fally start to read   mid January It is now mid February  I just fished Book 4 Goblet of Fire All I can say is Ms Rowlg really knows how to sp a yarn! This was the first time  years I stayed up until 1:30  the mng wh a book on a wk night because I couldn't put the book down until I'd fished  And the illiustrations are wonderful as wellI am so hooked! This delightful series of books brgs back memies of my own childhood when you were smaller than everyone else  had to deal wh mean teachers  other adults on their levelThese books have everythg: mystery drama pathos evil relatives rotten teachers school bullies  the feelg of flyg you get when somethg  your school child le FINALLY goes right!I will be among the people pre-derg Book 5 from Amazon when  is avaliable  be stg  the le at the movie theatre  November!Lastly I'd like to say THANK YOU to Ms Rowlg f givg us a wonderful sty that you can read to your grmother as well as your three year old Harry Potter is the son we all wish we could have  the child we wish we could have been By the end of this book I wish I could have traded places wh Mrs Weasley  hugged Harry myself!PS And I wish I could admister a nice swt kick to the nether regions of Harry's Aunt  Uncle Dursley What hrid people! They deserve whatever they get from Harry's magical friends!
JK Rowlg has done  aga wh HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE  I have enjoyed every book  the series  Book 4 is no exception  One could compare Rowlg's wk favably wh CS Lewis' NARNIA CHRONICLES  Susan Cooper's under-appreciated series THE DARK IS RISING  This is fiction f children which is engagg  enjoyable f adults as well  One of the thgs I appreciate most about Harry Potter is that he is growg up  these novels  like many of us his comg of age will not be entirely pleasant  successful  Granted occasionally thgs are slanted a b  his fav   would perhaps be me honest  the evil characters  Rowlg's books were evil due to outside fluences rather than their own personal wickedness but I rarely fd myself thkg about such matters when I'm actually readg the books  Harry Potter's struggles  discoveries are what make these books magnicent the wizardry element is just a b of fantasy that spices thgs up at times  After all what child ( adult) wouldn't want a broomstick that could make you fly?THE GOBLET OF FIRE dragged out a b at times which is why  doesn't get five stars but make no mistake the Harry Potter series books are defely wth readg whether you're 12  92 years old
This is the fourth book of the series   you have not read the first three I would recommend you to buy them Goblet of Fire is the latest of the series  the most enjoyable I just can't wa f the fth book
I love Harry Potter as do many members of my family This is my fave so far although  is a b darker than the previous I would suggest readg the three previous befe you read this one  will help you underst thgs much better! Do not let the 'size' of this book daunt you I overheard one woman  the bookste sayg  'looked like Clancy's Bear  the Dragon' This books reads very quickly  believe you me you will not be able to put  down!
Thgs take a dark turn at Hogwarts  this 4th  latest stallment of Rowlg's phenomenal Harry Potter series  It is also twice as long as s predecesss  Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better  While the climax is rivetg -  very frighteng - I felt there were moments scattered throughout the book that somewhat dragged I didn't have this complat wh the other three Still I kept turng the pages desperately wantg to know what was gog to happen nextRowlg troduces plenty of new characters - Profess &quotMad Eye&quot Moody is a really welcome addion -  contues to flesh out such familiar ones as Hermione Ron Hagrid  - of course - Harry who at fourteen is startg to come of age  This novel also features the rather hric -  I suppose evable - death of another fairly maj playerRowlg contues to impress me wh her seemgly limless creativy  I contued to be surprised  delighted   also rather repulsed by some of her less savy characters  cidents  A stm is defely gatherg  I look fward to seeg where thgs lead  the fth  subsequent volumes
Wow  Remember: Constant vigilance  Pay attentions to all the m details  Like the previous 3 books this is a page-turner In spe of the thickness of this book every chapter is fun too read  Rowlg does a good enough job to save a few details f her next few books  the series Lots of suspense  feshadowg Remember constant vigilance while readg!
After gettg this book at a credibly good price of $16 I noticed this book wasn't nearly as good as the other three Exept f the crouches there wasn't much exment  the book &amp the triwizard tournament was extremly dull
Although this book was perhaps a ltle darker than the other three  is a must read!  I do question whether some of this matieral is sued f young readers but I feel that  is appropriate f teenagers  young adults  I cannot wa to get Rol's next book but  will be a long long waF those who want an idea of what this book is about It starts out wh the Wld Cup Quiddch match where the sky is l by the Dark Ld's sign  Then when Harry  group do to school they fd that all Quiddch matched are cancelled at Hogwarts this year because of a cometetion between three school of magic  Harry is entered  chosen as one of the compets (who didn't see that comg?!)  The rest of the book contas Harry  the other compets facg thier challenges  Harry also has personal challenges from not only Malfoy &amp company but also from Ron  Hermione  I am lookg fward to seeg Harry 5th year at Hogwart's  What's next on Harry's agenda of adventures?  Rol please hurry!  I cannot wa f Book 5 6  7 to be published!!!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was an other magial h by Rowlg At the begg Harry  his friends go to the Qutich Wld Cup where somethg dangerous occurs From that pot the plot gets me adventurebound  excg page by page This book is a must read f both the old  young
I loved the book too bad all teachers don't appreciate 
This book is great f anybody!I could be 100 years old   this would still be my fave!JK Rowlg clearly is a very talented wrer! She makes the characters come to le  you can't help but to love them!!!!!You should read this book no matter who you areboy  girl10  100!!!!!!!
These books are good  i can't deny not enjoyg this bookuntil the end that was These books are NOT the best thgs to h the wld of fiction n is JK Rowlg the best auth  the wld In my humble opion that is Stephen Kg's Dark Tower seriesSo Diggys death was a b of a shock but Harry escapg defatly was not Then after that what preceeds is a talk rangg f about twenty pages where (as per usual) good old wise Dumblede explas everythg to Harry  co who just st of nod along Then you get the typical temper tantrem where Harry shouts a lot at grown ups (why can't he learn respect) This is the most annoyg thg about the bookIn the third book when harry pots his w at Sirius he says somethg like &quotAre you gog to kill me Harry?&quot Well evidently he wasn't because accdg to THIS book he doesn't know the curse yet alone makg  wk ( how DO you  wk anyway?And why does a wizardg society celebrate Christmas when Cristians are completly agast any kd of scery  magic? Seems a b strange that's allAnother stupid thg about this book is that self-righteus polically crect Hemione gog on about those stupid house elfs No one cares! Who is she to decide what's  there best terests?Sry to some people who haven't read anythg other than this but 's nothg special
If you haven't read books 1 2  3 don't read this This book is defately &quotpivotal&quot The suspense is built masterfully The new characters are credible HarryRead the book to fd out the endg of this sentence Enjoy the mystery once aga I eagerly awa book 5
Once I was done wh Harry Potter #4 I was still thkg about  like I had done wh the other books I've thought about  f a long time  have come to a few thgs There are many thgs to enjoy  the book such as the Quiddch Wld Cup the Triwizard Tournament  the compellg endg But this book isn't whout flaws- such as why didn't Ld Voldemt try returng to power  the previous books stead of tryg to kill Harry all the time? He did try  the first book but  didn't have much to do wh Harry till the end Also wh Harry  the other kids at the age of fourteen the all too ltle b of romance  the book wasn't realistic I mean people might not start havg romantic relationships until that age but what about romantic thoughts? Another thg is the 'cocidences' long explanations The 'concidences' such as how Ld Voldemt could've risen aga whout Harry made me thk about how JK Rowlg could've improved  that spot Also the lengthy  complicated plan of usg the Triwizard Cup could've been shtened to somethg by far me simple  perhaps me effective- Ld Voldemt could've killed Harry then But of course there are three me books to go  many me possibilies And maybe me narrow escapes  JK Rowlg keeps on wrg wh her fmula of 1 The Dursleys 2 Out of the Dursleys 3 At Hogwarts 4 Danger brews along wh mysteries remag unsolved 5 Mysteries solved  lengthy explanations  an apocolyptic end battle But knowg Rowlg  her knack f suprises that might all change  book five six  seven which are expected to be much darker than ever Some ways Rowlg could improve is by usg a dferent sty fmat stead of just stickg new stuff  the old to make  look new develop the characters a ltle me (Harry Ron  Hermoe will be turng fteen!  make Ld Voldemt me of a bad guy  actually give him realistic  at least terestg motives stead of sany f dog bad thgs On the other h there were some very valid good parts of the book F example JK Rowlg's skill f suprises kept people quessg Although most of the characters seem to be thkg that the same person ( st of person) was behd  all stead of thkg deeper There was also the fact that all the characters are very unique (though perhaps underdeveloped) So f all these various reasons I rate Harry Potter #4 four stars Hum  suspense did make up f a lot but I'll be keepg  md these pots  flaws as I awa the fth book  eventually read estg motives stead of sany f dog bad thgs On the other h there were some very valid good parts of the book F example JK Rowlg's skill f suprises kept people quessg Although most of the characters seem to be thkg that the same person ( st of person) was behd  all stead of thkg deeper There was also the fact that all the characters are very unique (though perhaps underdeveloped) So f all these various reasons I rate Harry Potter #4 four stars Hum  suspense did make up f a lot but I'll be keepg  md these pots  flaws as I awa the fth book  eventually read 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an excg fast-paced book I suggest the 4th Harry Potter book to anyone who is lookg f an adventure  an trestg book  Like the other Harry Potter books pre-datg   is an excg  adventurous book to all young readers  even some older ones as well  I would suggest you read the previous Harry Potter books The Scerers Stone The Chamber of Secrets  The Prisoner of Azkaban to catch up on this thiswld famous sty of a fictional boy his le  In conclusion I believe that any one lookg f a good book should read this magical tale captivatg readers of all ages
These Harry books are nice funny - dark too but as you deg deeper to the material you always see some light  delight tooOne of the thgs that disturb me is that few people mention how close these books are to the seven Narnia-sties as wrten by CSLewis These were wrten f children too - but  the same way even me appreciated as people grow older CSLewis was a christian (explicly) - however  his Narnia sties nothg christian is mentioned directly - n do you fd &quotcheap&quot signs as to christian values At a first glance you get beauty  ugly light  darkness (yes wches  all kds of figures too)  4 children -  only 2 of them  some of the books - who grew up  learn credible thgs But  many thgs Harry Potter remds exactly of all that - except that CSLewis wasn't fluenced by the stupidy of today's Pokemon-stuff JKRowlg is  some way
Durg the first week of my first grade I fell sick I had to rema at home f over three weeks I was very sad because I didn't want to be left alone while all the other kids were makg their first contact wh the school  s numerous secrets I had heard so much about (teachers homewk- yes I was a very naive young boy) Wishg to cheer me up my mother decided to read me The Lion the Wch  the Wardrobe by CS Lewis the first of the Narnia series This was one of my first contacts wh fairy tales Each mng I woke up lookg fward to hearg the adventures of Lucy Peter Susan  Edmund  the magical l of Narnia I still remember the troduction of the book wrten by CS Lewis It said: "Dear Lucy I wrote this sty f you but when I began  I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books As a result you are already too old f fairy tales  by the time  is prted  bound you will be older still But some day you will be old enough to start readg fairy tales aga You can then take  down from some upper shelf dust   tell me what you thk of " I didn't underst  then but  seems so crystal clear to me todayWhen I first heard about the huge "wave" caused by Harry Potter series I didn't pay much attention to  True I heard that children  adults all over the wld were crazy about the ltle nerdish like boy  his friends but I remaed too deaf to hear I couldn't underst how older people could be so fond of this Harry Potter guy?

This book has some fantastic subversive themes runng through  I enjoyed the three novels that preceded Goblet of Fire but while readg this one I just kept chucklg to myself as I realized that millions of dynamic young mds are absbg the lessons  this book As kids read  re-read this delightful sty they learn to distrust sensationalist news media (Ra Skeeter) as well as people  authy (Mister of Magic Cnelius Fudge) who willgly turn a bld eye to the unpopular truths that threaten their posions ally themselves wh malevolent fces (the Dements) when convenient  tentionally whip up public hysteria  prejudice to margalize my groups (giants  half-giants)  Much thanks to JK Rowlgs f wkg all of these lessons  conscious autonomy to such an engagg  entertag narrative
JK Rowlg's wrg is changg  's f the better &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is much longer than any of the precedg three books  wrten at a much me sophisticated level The edg is tighter the focus me detailed  the pace faster Still the wrg remas accessible to kids as  is simple economical  visualRowlg's imagation is first-rate lerally conjurg up all sts of magical creatures  aptly-named people (each wh their own personaly) She also creates some delightful plays on wds particularly  her use of Lat msels of wds f spell names&quotGoblet of Fire&quot is not just longer than previous stalments but is me serious (dealg wh themes of love death friendship  betrayal) darker (wh me liberal  graphic violence particularly towards the end)  sister (evil on the upsurge no simple &quotgood ws&quot endg) It is much like the &quotEmpire Strikes Back&quot a darker me tricate  me severe part of the series that fills out the backsty  provides many new plot twists The next few books promise much
I resisted the Harry Potter phenomenon  then fally gave  out of sheer curiosy  The series of books has renewed my fah  kids  their appete f good stytellg  Harry Potter is a likeable character  Despe rather dire circumstances he doesn't mope  feel sry f himself  A rather desirable role model f kids  The magical wld woven by the auth is imagative  utterly compellg  This book is long  almost feels like two sties - Harry's summer  adventure at the Quiddich match befe school starts  then his adventure at school  competg  the great contest  But  does hold together despe s length  leaves you eager f Book #5  Brg  on!
Harry Potter has taken the wld by stm  Wh s excellent sty le s -depth sometimes amusg characters  other elements of the sty make this the best book I have ever had the pleasure of readg  I do not believe this is a book f children but  is a book f all  I have many friends  relatives readg this book who are well older than me  They have enjoyed  just as much as me  are eagerly anticipatg the next stallment of this fantastic book  In the meantime I have dered the &quotHarry Potter Schoolbooks: Quiddch Through the Ages  Fantastic Beasts  Where to Fd Them&quot from this very se (Amazon) to hold me over until Book 5 which will be called &quotHarry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix&quot  I give this series 2 million 473 thous 5 hundred  32 stars
This was by far the best out of the four I am f one year studg abroad  cha I'm not sure  the 5th one's come out yet but of the first four this exceded all expectations i held f  I am 13  just reccently started readg  large quanties this was the book that really got me started I was very happy to hear that this book was gog to be a long one ltle did i know f at the end of all three of the others i was left wantg me 734 pages! I haven't seen the book  6 months 's still  Akron ohio on my bedside table  i remember the page numberof that book not only because 's a fairly easy number to remember but because i fd myself decussg harry potter facts wh my english teacher that i remember loads of facts from this book  i believe that's because everythg  that book was amazgly terestg I found myself  my last days  america stayg  my room f hours at a time readg the sties of harry  his friends Most of all i would have to say i liked the way that every sgle event 'kept me on my toes'  Everythg wh this sty was terestg not  a thk 's terestg  fget about  5 mutes later kd of terestg but  a kd of terestg where you actually set the book down (how ever hard that is to do)  thk about that event by self f however long you what f know one could ever get tired of thkg of the events I liked how the dferent characts from dferent cultures teracted wh each other whether  helpg one another  plotg agast each other wh all their strength These ar emy reasons f givg this book 4stars
Havg read Books 1-3 I am me than ready to tackle Book 4 despe 's length  And I must say that the series remds of the great books of my youth cludg Narnia  A Wrkle  TIme But even adults can learn somethg  My father died 2 years ago  Harry's relationship wh his parents resonates wh me especially  the sty le of Book 3  In case you've fgotten about your loves  your losses read Harry PotterPS - I thk that Ms Rowlg owes us Yanks a translation of certa terms  ideas to American  I fd  hard to believe that Americans really underst the system at Hogwarts!
I am 15 years old  live  Greece my sister (21 yrs old) one day decided to buy me the 4th book of the Harry Potter seriesF the past three days i had exams  yet found the time to read this great book  If u thk  is just a lame book f kids thk agaThe book is a ptal of fantasy i had fgotten all about fantasy yet i cant wa f the 5th book of the series to come outThe book presents  very comftg mix of action plot  frienship  The settg is magical  u liked the books relatg to the l of Narnia (The Lion the wch  the waredrobe)  you will like this ten times meRowlg creates a wld which is  the range of possibily  the reader's md trully can fly to a magical wld which can be possible to some extentI recommend you read  a book of all ages  races a book f you to remember friends  the magical thoughts you once thought
When I fished the last page of 'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' I could only close the book  s stunned I am 16 years old  started readg Harry Potter out of my own curiosy I fished the first three wh two weeks   did not take me long to figure out that these were no 'kid' books as I had thoughtBefe I even began to tackle the monster fourth novel I already knew that Rowlg had cast a magical spell over me wh wds I prowled through the halls of Hogwarts wh Harry Ron  Hermione I zoomed through the skies on my Firebolt I avoided evil professs such as Snape I won't spoil the plot of the fourth novel f you but Harry  Voldemt meet to duke  out aga And 's far far me serious than anythg that has happened so farAlthough the book was 734 pages I never got bed  I never wanted  to end Considerably darker than the easy-gog first novel 'Goblet of Fire' delves to the me complicated themes of good vs evil self-sacrice  fgiveness A wd of warng though  you have not read the first three novels upon readg this book you will not enjoy  to s fullest extent The connectg plot structures between the dferent books are absolutely astonishg I can't wa f book five
Just as I thk that JK Rowlg cannot pull me  any further she tops  wh this book  I found  to be the most terestg most well-wrten of the bunchNot once was I bed  fact I groaned whenever I had to put the book down  Although 's lengthy the readg time flies by  In fact I read  wh less than one week  The endg was surprisg  the development of the characters was much better than the last threeI am lookg fward to readg the next stallments of Harry Potter series  I only hope they can top the suspense trigue  overall superbness of this book!
This is the thickest volume so far  the series of adventure of Harry Potter  what an adventure  is! JK Rowlg returned to her best fm  takg us through the magical wld of Harry Potter Personally I felt that the first three books were too similar   JK Rowlg would contue the same fmula  the fourth book this outstg series might lose my terest It appeared that my wry was unjustied though because while there are some familiar events from previous books most of the events  this book are new  me excg than ever Now that Harry was four years older than when we first know him he started to develop teenager's problems eg love  jealousy While the most of the book is delightful  contas some of the funniest events  the series (ballroom dance came to my md) the last part of the book also contas the darkest most thrillg moment of the series so far All of the characters  this book are terestg  less stereotypical Overall  you are a fan of Harry Potter this is a must-read If you're disappoted wh the 2nd  3rd book then this one might renew your fah  the series Now I can't wa f the next sequel!
Overall this is an terestg sty but sadly is a disappotg turn f the series  The ed should have taken out a red pen f this one  Entire passages not only could have been but should have been slashed  Much of the plot is predictable somethg that surprised me after the twists  turns of the first 3 books  The only redeemg qualies are a strong climax  the fact that the kids are showg signs of maturg  rather accurately as well
I am an adult  have read all 4 books I personally loved the 4th book but I thk the few curse wds  filthy jokes could have been left out sce this book is tended f ages 9-12 The auth totally changed wrg method f this book  I am disgusted I am also a Christian  do not disapprove of the sty content just leave out the filth  Children are readg these f Heaven's sake!
Though this is easily the meatiest of the Harry Potter series at over 700 pages I ripped through   about six hours -- this is keep-you-up-at-night extradarily engrossg readg The excement extends from the fact that Ron  Harry are begng to notice girls to Harry's vision of his parents (I'll try not to say me f fear of spoilg)My fave part of this series -- which I began readg on a lark at Christmas to see what all the fuss was about -- is watchg Harry Potter *grow up* I'm 22  I can remember readg series like *The Baby-Ster's Club*  *Sweet Valley High* where the characters were eternally eighth graders  high school junis respectively It's completely refreshg to see Harry mature  confront ever me dficult aspects of his past as he gets farther through Hogwarts yet the fun of the series is absolutely not lostI'll be first  le  at least fightg f that posion the day we get to see Harry turn fteen  start another year
I hadn't planned to read the latest publishg sensation but I read Harry Potter's adventures over Christmas  while I cannot say that  has won a place  my heart as a favoure I enjoyed myself hugely while readg It is not as though Rowlg's idea is terribly igal although she has revialised the old 'wizard's school' sty wh elements like Quiddch  details like the choosg of a w ( a w choosg a wizard/wch)  of course great charaters like Hagrid  Hermione really make the sties fascatg even f reader familiar wh the genre  What really sts out is her deft touch of humour her tensely volved plots (of which this book 4 is a stellar example  is amazg to compare  wh the precedg 3 books -  is so much me controlled  water-tight no loose-ends considerg how complex  was)  her effective way of evokg emotion at crucial pots of her sty eg Harry's longg f his parents is a constant theme  concepts such as love loyalty  friendship are expledAll the cricism regardg wch-craft surroundg the Rowlg mystique are que laughable  Magic is the subject-matter of the book - to compla agast the Harry Potter books is to compla agast the a large proption of the whole genre  fantasy as a whole  Are we to be deprived of such imagation  fiction on the basis of religious tolerance?I was struck by the level of &quotdarkness&quot  the books but  tends to be gross (descriptions of Voldemt are pretty grim)  not violent f violence sake  In fact the death of Cedric Diggy was dealt wh  one of the me humane ways I have seen death dealt wh  recent examples of media  It is not taken lightly  the bookAll  all I am left anticipatg wh millions of other readers Book 5!  Keep up the good wk Ms Rowlg
JK Rowlg has proven herself to be a terric wrer as shown  the previous Harry Potter books but this one is perhaps the most telligent of them all  The unexpected plot twists the sheer brilliance the style of her wrg they all add up to a great novel  Ty clues hidden throughout the book will seem unimptant but 's the small aspects that have the most signicant impact on the sty A must-have f mystery lovers hr lovers  really anyone who knows how to read
J K Rowlg's Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire is an excellent book to add to the already amazg collection of Harry Potter books  This book adds to Rowlg's astoundg imagation  She uses so many amazg elements  the book  F example she has all the people that are  photographs come to le  can move around throughout the picture  others as well  These have been  all the Harry Potter collection but  this book the pictures go to a new level which is that the people  the pictures are seen all over the school  which Harry attends  Rowlg also adds dragons  mermaids to Goblet of Fire which are extradary descriptions  The one thg that makes this book dferent from all the other Harry Potter book's is the amount of new elements that come from the school  Harry has to do a lot me school  the reader learns along wh Harry how to do disarmg spells swim underwater whout air travel through time defeat a dragon  travel through time  Also a very new element is The Triwizard Tournament which takes the place of Quiddch a game played on broomsticks  The Triwizard Tournament is a tournament of three tasks  This tournament is very dangerous  is le threateng  Of course what would a Harry Potter book be like whout a villa?  Harry has to deal wh Ld Voldermt once aga  on the way he makes some amazg discoveries about himself  his family  The book is filled immense detail  takes the reader's imagation  heart on a roller-coaster ride that is full of the twist turns  loops all over

OK OK I'm the last person on earth to review The Goblet of Fire I was virtually fced by my 10 year old daughter to read the first Harry Potter book that I purchased f her a few years ago As soon as I fished that tome I was on to 2 then 3  now 4 As a 39 year old adult I never thought the magic could return but  has JK Rowlg is certaly wthy of every wonderful thg that can be wrten about her She teaches us much like Gene Roddenbury did  Star Trek Well done Ms Rowlg! I can't wa f 5 The magic is back!  Kev Hogan 
This book was exellent I would reccomend this book to anybody I reccomend This book because I can relate to  After the summer I look fward to gog to school aga Anoter reason I relate to this is that I have some friends  there is a bully like Malfoy  every school This book does a good job of mixg fiction  non-fiction That is an imptant qualy to me when I read a non-fiction book Even  's a ltle realy Overall the most imptant thg to me is beg able to relate to the charicters
This is yet another stant classic  the Harry Potter series It's a sharp slick novel that will have you guessg until the very end  beyond After readg the last le of the book you will want to know me Hopefully Ms Rowlg won't keep us wag long  Harry is growg up  startg to face real grown up thgs such as crushes school dances   thoughts of le as an adult wizard There's treachery afoot at Hogwarts  Harry is voluntarily thrown right to the middle of  Our reluctant hero faces many brutal challenges  eventually comes face to face wh Evil self Don't let the size of this book scare you I read   two days mostly because I couldn't put  down! Treat yourself to a wonderful novel
I thought that  was good but not that good the other Harry Potter  books i liked better It is still a defate read  you have read the other three I thk  lacks the igaly of the others but mabey thats becasue i have read the others so many times that this one beg new seems way dferent
Through the chapters of &quotThe Unexpected Task&quot  the &quotYule Ball&quot I was laughg VERY hard   all I could do was gush  say &quotA[] fancy each other!&quot I was wried there f a moment sce Harry &amp the rest of the gang are 14 don't they atleast have feelgs f each other? but Alas I got my romance fix  this book :) I really recommend this but  you're a newbie try readg the other books first  DON'T let the page count (gosh 700+!) discourage you! Believe me when you get started readg  time flies by  you're already at the half of the book! It's very charismaticI'm a new fan of the series Not too long ago I refused to read  because of all the hype (I was  a stage where I hated everythg that's popular wk wk but that stage has passed ftunately) but I Fally gave   read Scerer's Stone when my curiousy fally got to me So here I am a new Harry Potter convert! I can't wa f the next book though the Genious Jo(MsRowlg) said that GINNY will have a larger part! she's one of my fave characters Ron Hermione Harryoh I love all of them!
I loved the first 3 Harry Potter books but this one I really did not like the endg  Also the whole book was not that great I almost predicted everythg
This book is mcuh better than any of the previous ones It is funny  charmg yet  begs to deal wh darker issues I do not recommend this book f young children It is frighteng  there is a death I'm sure you all know the basic plot so I won't say me (  you haven't I don't want to give anythg away!) I do have one complat The book does not give a coherent picture of the magical wld There is no explanation of s boundaries  ig It gives the books the appearance of beg poly thought out
I realize that although  seems like I have been readg my whole le I am only  High School  so have a long ways to go yet But I still read a lot me than most people my age  I can honestly say that the Harry Potter books are the best I have ever read ever I really liked this one because of the way  was laid out It was almost like you had three suspenseful endgs (the tournament) but honestly the real endg just blew me away! My heart was poundg I was breathg fast I've never had a book do that to me befe! Beatg my recd f book 3 I stayed up 'till 5:30 AM readg this! Read this book but don't start  when you have a lot to do because I can guarantee you everythg else will take a back seat untill you close the book at the fal page
Befe I read these books I thought all the clam over them was ridiculous  Now after havg read them I still thk  is a b silly (have you SEEN some of the tie- products) but I can underst how  got started - the Harry Potter series is terric  My sister got the first book f Christmas  sce I was curious about the whole Harry Potter thg I decided to see  they lived up to their hype  Whout a doubt they blew my expectations away  These books are addictg - I just went  bought the fourth one sce I couldn't get  from the library fast enough  I enjoyed the fourth one as much as I enjoyed the first three  While  is que a b longer than the others  didn't feel drawn-out as I was readg   (though I agree that  easily could have been 200pgs shter w/ everythg of imptance still  )  the endg was credible  It is annoyg though that  will be a fairly long wa to the next one (especially sce I read the first 4  2 weeks)  As f objections that these books are anti-Christian  promote wchcraft I feel they are unfounded  While I underst this view - the Bible is rather clear  prohibg wchcraft as their &quotmagic&quot is from Satan - this type of magic is not anythg like that  the book  The magic  the books is very similar to the Fce  Star Wars - a power wholly unconnected to any dey( fact most likely created when the universe was created) - where some dividuals have the abily to use the power  choose f themselves whether they will use  f good  f evil  The magic used by Rowlg's characters  the magic prohibed  the Bible are entirely dferent IMHO  only have the misftune of sharg the same name
The book is supposed to be one of the hottest out there but when I fished  I couldn't underst what all the hoopla was about  The book starts out well enough whout the usual dribble at the Dursleys' but  dragged on way too long  I also disliked the fact that Rowlg seemed to condone slavery  When Hermione starts lobbyg agast the slavery of the elves she's a joke  Harry  Ron just laugh at her  convce her that the elves LIKE to be slaves  What kd of message is that?  The dance was also unsatisfacty because Harry didn't even do much wh Cho  This book was supposed to be the begng of his romantic le  yet he's still completely experienced  Some aspects were terestg like the three tasks but the endg left me wantg me  It seemed to be too abrupt  you can believe that about this 700 page book  Anyway I'd say that the book's content didn't mer the frenzy but  you want a cute distraction
Rowlg has a fantastic sty-tellg style that keeps one bound to the book till  is completed  leaves one askg f me  In this fourth book of the series she managed to sp  the emotions that both children  adults relate  feel f  their dferent wlds
When i first heard of the Harry Potter books- I thought &quotHow stupid!&quot but these books proved otherwise  The fourth book - my fave- was amazg  It showed good friendship between Harry  his friend Ron who envy's harry's fame  Hermione is the top student at Hogwarts  The enemy Draco comes wh new terestg sties everytime they meet  But most imptantly wh the Dark Ld risg aga  Harry's name secretly put  the Goblet of Fire  who is his friend  who's tryg to kill him?
This was a fantastic book By far the best one yet  my personal opion The plots were great   really kept you readg  I thought  was so great that Rowlg  took a defe change  events at Hogwarts I loved the twist at the end of Harry battlg agast Voldemt Rowlg isn't keepg Harry Potter a ltle kid like a lot of children auths do wh their characters She is lettg him grow up  lettg the reader see that he is maturg I like the way she does that because  not only makes the books enjoyable to kids but to teenagers  adults as well Rowlg is one of the most talented auths today She derserves all the cred she gets
This book did not disappot me  the slightest  I thought nothg could be better after the third book but I was clearly wrong  It is a delightful read  on a higher level than her previous books  terms of plot character depiction  The characters of Harry Hermione Ron  even the new characters really seem alive to meThis is what really made Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire an enjoyable  entertag book f me to read  We see me of the dynamics of Harry's wld  not just one aspect of 
After pickg up the book  noticg  was somewhere near the same size as &quotThe Grapes of Wrath&quot I didn't thk  was possible f a young child to read   That was all befe I read the first chapter  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot was the third out of the series f me to read  easily the best  Once you pick up  s a hard book to put down  The problem that I noticed wh the others is simply I wanted to read me  me  the books weren't long enough this one gave me even me satisfaction  entertament  If your buyg this book f your child  will teach him  her that they can conquer long books  The readg level isn't very high but almost anyone can enjoy   I found myself daydreamg about &quotQuidch&quot the spt played on broom sticks  wonderg myself what  would be like to perfm magic  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot allows you to escape the wld  which we live   live wh our imagations  a wld were people like you  me are outcasts  fall  love wh those who are dferent  If your anywhere from the age of 5 to 95 then you can enjoy the wonderful wld of magic  Harry Potter
JK Rowlg never ceases to amaze! When I first saw that Goblet of Fire was a 700+ page-book I decided that she had fally lost her md  She hasn't  Here is a 700-page book that will keep children riveted the entire way Rowlg is brilliant  She laces the book wh multiple sties all trigug  And her characters  sense of hum just get sharper  sharper wh each book Goblet of Fire is a book that you purchase to read to your kids then fd yourself sneakg off to enjoy on your own!
JK Rowlg has done  aga  told the magical  excg sty of the boy of Prive drive Harry PotterThis is the fourth book of the Harry Potter series  Harry is  his fourth year at Hogwarts(the magical school) This year their is gog to be the Triwizard Tournament takg place f the first time  ages  Harry wants to jo the Tournament but he's not aloud to jo because he's to young Will Harry put his name  even though he's to young  will he leave the Tournament alone? Read the Great fourth book of this wonderful series I would suggest readg the other three befe readg thisEnjoy!
When I started readg this book I knew  was gog to be my fave book  the Harry Potter series!Sce then I have read this book about 10 times  listened to  beg read on CD about 5 times (which is 17 CDs to listen to)The plot of this book is great  There is great suspense     makes you want to stay up all night to see what happens nextThe Harry Potter books  my opion are kd of like Philip Pullman's Golden Compass  Subtle Kne but they are not as far-fetched  easier to understHarry Potter is an phan who lives wh his non-magical aunt  uncle  He is a wizard  attends Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry along wh his best friends Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger  This year the Triwizard Tournament takes place at Hogwarts  someone mysteriously enters his name to the Goblet of Fire the judge of who would be the wthiest contestant to perfm the three tasks from Hogwarts Durmstrang  Beauxbatons (other wizardg schools)This is the longest book  the Harry Potter series so far but  my opion  is the best!
Harry Potter fans will be once aga delighted wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire JK Rowlg's fourth book about the adventurous young wizard Harry Potter This particular book contues to Harry's fourth school year at Hogwarts a wizardg school f young wizards  wches  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire takes the reader to the Triwizard Tournament a dangerous event wh dragons mazes  other surprises An underage Harry is entered  the contest  must compete wh other wizards from rival schools Harry ends up meetg his old enemy &quotyou know who&quot  a terryg dual of ws  magic  What makes this book best sellg is the auth's imagative  ventive style - her fascatg characters made-up vocabulary  clever ventions One really neat character is Hagrid who was kicked out of Hogwts  now lives on the edge of the school Harry  his friends vis Hagrid  fd out all sts of terestg facts about the school cludg teacher rivalries old friends  other mysterious trivia  JK Rowlg displays her creativy wh her fun vented wds Muggle is one of the coolest wd because  is what we are humans Some other fun to say wds are Hufflepuff Slyther Gryffd  Ravenclaw which are the names of the rival dms at Hogwarts  Another wd that has a great name  meang is Omniocular an vention  which  &quotyou can replay action  slow everythg down   they flush up a play-by-play breakdown  you need &quot(93) These wizard-like boculars are used to watch Quiddch games (wizard's rugby)  Rowlg's imagation goes on  on wh other magical ventions cludg flags that sg songs visibily coats dragons  magical cy  Along wh the good vs evil theme seen  previous Harry Potter books Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire has a theme of loyalty Harry Hermione  Ron's friendship was one of loyalty F example when Hermione  Ron got to a fight Harry helped them become friends aga Harry's relationship wh the house elves was also a loyal one Harry offered to reward their service of cookg  cleang wh pay but they didn't believe that house elves should be paid Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of those rare books that any muggle would enjoy! Rowlg's creativy wh her characters made-up vocabulary  ventions would appeal to readers of all ages From flyg broomsticks to ptkey transptation this book is the way to gogot to a fight Harry helped them become friends aga Harry's relationship wh the house elves was also a loyal one Harry offered to reward their service of cookg  cleang wh pay but they didn't believe that house elves should be paid Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of those rare books that any muggle would enjoy! Rowlg's creativy wh her characters made-up vocabulary  ventions would appeal to readers of all ages From flyg broomsticks to ptkey transptation this book is the way to go
I first began readg the Harry Potter series me than a year ago after learng that kids were abong video games  TV to read It must be good I thought but what could  possibly offer adults? But I loved the first three books  reserved a copy of Goblet of Fire two months befe  came outI won't address the plot pots etc because the other reviews have done that so well  because I want to make a dferent pot: Adults should read this book This book Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts is wonderful And  is appropriate f children AND adults Adults need to stop sneerg at Harry Potter The sty  vocabulary are not beneath any reader (Rowlg uses wds such as &quotunctuous&quot  &quotsycophantically&quot wds I didn't know until college) So adults get over   give  a try
Each book  the Harry Potter series seems to be an improvement over the one befe  I've liked all of the books but this one is my fave so far It starts out  the Riddle house a change from the begng of the first 3 books which seems to signal that this book is darker than the others From there we learn that Harry has been ved to the Quiddch Wld Cup wh the Weasleys which provides f comic relief as the wizards try to act like muggles The plot moves fairly slowly throughout the book but contues to flow nicely  The only places  seems to stumble are wh Hermione's battle to free the house elves (I still don't really see the pot behd that plotle)  the lengthy fight between Ron  Harry  The endg felt rushed  some places but also seemed to take fever All  all though this book is defely wth your time to read- no matter what your age I just hope the 5th one comes out soon
Okay I adm I bought the book f my daughter  But you know what they say you should always try to keep up wh what your kids are to  Well  sounds like a good excuse anyway  I fished  the first day after  came!  Personally I thk this one is the best so far  (I had to check the others out - too)First off  be aware this is a hefty one  Over 700 pages  It reads very quickly  is full of not only great action but me cerebral action as well  We fd out a b me about some of the stard characters - Hagrid's background f example We also learn me of the wizardg communy  general And of the schools  their methods specically ( me ways than one)Rowlg is dog a great job of developg the characters as the books go on  Harry  Ron are growg up some  They're even st of begng to notice girls My only crique is that Harry  never seems to be  the wrong n does he lose  As she is makg other characters me  me realistic  Harry seems to be becomg less  less so  She still keeps a fair balance of his secury there but he is becomg somewhat over confident  me than a ltle spoiled  (I'm sure Snape would be me snide about   but he essentially is begng to sound crect sometimes)Incidentally  after I &quotchecked  out&quot f my daughter she also sat down  read  stoppg only when we fced her to eat sleep play  She has sce read  2 me times  So  nothg else I would recommend this book on the basis that   can hold a 7 year old's attention like that  spe of 's size  my cricisms Rowlg is obviously dog somethg right
When you thk that the 3rd book is the best of Harry Potter thk aga The Goblet of Fire is MUCH better JK Rowlg has misty me wh this book  kept me readg this whole book whole night throughAga  this 4th book when you thk that you know what will happen next thk aga Aga JK Rowlg has provide us a great endg which is very hard  not impossible to guess but still make a whole lot of sense  make  very very terestg It gives me a sigh of pleasure  a smile after fishg JK Rowlg has made a great move by dog a triwizard tournament  this 4th book avoidg another quiddch tournament that would appear to be redundant Also the troduction to other magical school around the globe has given this book another spark  open up a whole big possibilies of what will be comg up next  the 5th Harry PotterThis book has also give me personal touch to some of the ma characters which was lackg  the 3 previous books It is very lovely of how the book pictures Hermyone Ron Fred Gege Percy Longbottom  several other  me vivid way It also gives a better ptrayal of the You-Know-Who  his followersCan't wa f the 5th Book  hope  is at least as good as this one
i read this book the longest time ago  i'm bed right now so i decided to wre this review  Anyway i thought this was another great stallment  the series  Sadly  was the weakest  The book as a whole was good but the begng was bg  It seemed to me like rowlg was just wrg filler f the book to look bigger  longer  The endg however was grippg  held me onto the book  If  weren't f the endg this would have been a complete disappotment stead of the m one  turned out to be
Reasons why I didn't like this book as much as the others 1 It could have been about 400 pages but so many unnecessary subplots  repetions required about three hundred pages 2 The whole &quota character will die&quot thg turned out to be a maj disappotmentFirst of all revealg  the death of a character  der to hype up the book wasn't fair to the readers It took the surprise away But there wasn't any surprise because I new Rollg wouldn't have the guts to kill of an imptant character  3Voldemt is like your typical bad guy Just pla old bad He plots to kill Harry  most dficult way  as always is foiled I wish Rollg had killed him off  the second  third book  troduced new villiansAlso the plot is gettg too childish f me I ask myself questions like &quot shouldn't magic people be ignent  all they know is magic?&quot all the time 4 My fal complat is that shouldn't Harry be disturbed  his Aunt  uncle always treated him like that? somethg to thk about
embarrassg as  may be f a person my age (14) to say this is a good book!! actually much to the annoyance of my parents i usually pick up books such as the sweet valley series  love sties  makg out but this was so hyped up that i was kd of curious about  so i bought   stashed  at the back of my closet until a couple days ago this book rocks!! 's funny  has action everythg!! 's even got some romance (hee hee) cho chang should so get wh harry!! *lol* my dad rolled his eyes when i said this out loud while readg the book  the livg room!! anyway this book is REALLY great   totally lives up to the hype get !! (even  you're fced to hide  when your friends come over!)
i had been avoidg dear old Harry Potter till a week ago Then I picked up the first book (you know beg at  the begng)  have read the four books almost back to back First was enchantg second was bg third picked up magic aga  the fourth just splatters  all over the place like a big gy picture Sure 's darker sure there's death  mayhem  all kds of dark arts but 700 pages befe you come to the the duel that fizzes  comparison to the earlier endgsEverythg is overdone  this book stretched to the extent that  leaves you tired  yet dissatsied I am remded of a dialog somewhere the auth had too much material  never made any choices just threw everythg  The result? It's huge mostly not-funny (Ron Weasly is almost not present wh his wisecracks f a good part of the book)  doesn't leave a happy feelg at the end despe your efft to stick wh the 700 odd pagesI thk the next book should just have footnotes f references to earlier occurences To read pages about how quiddch   histy of Dursleys  so on gets irratg sometimes
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of the most enjoyable books I have read  a long time  The sty becomes so  depth much like the previous books that you connect wh the characters Harry is the type of person that will always make the right decision  any suation  f this I admire him  His friends are as much enjoyable  the sty as him Wh each decision Harry makes his friends play a val role  this is the reason I enjoyed this book so much Because there is not just one hero throughout the book The book does not follow the sty of just one person Harry's friends are cluded  almost every suation which makes the sty a very enjoyable read!
***New Material***I don't suppose anyone will ever see this coda but recently (2012) I have been re-readg the series out loud to my six year-old daughter I have a renewed respect fo JK Rowlg's talent as a wrer - not f her plot  her imagative universe but her simple abily to construct an elegant sentence Readg out loud is a tremendous test of that aspect of a wrer's craft Both the Philosopher's Stone  the Chamber of Secrets are a pleasure to say I cannot say that however of the Goblet of Fire does not Rowlg's prose is noticeably me leaden  convoluted It is weighed down wh unnecessary modiers There are thickets of unterestg cidental details which get  the way of the plot's progression This is a far less "wrerly" efft I wonder whether the dems of the publisher's schedule became overwhelmg f  feels verily like the sub-edg stage has been skipped on this book To such a pot that I don't thk I can brg myself to start the next one(I have downgraded my ratg)***Origal Review***After three books you couldn't help noticg a pretty rigid plot fmula  the Harry Potter books: Harry starts out  Privet Drive goes to Hogwarts sglehedly ws a val Quiddch match encounters eher a mysterious but seemgly friendly character who turns out (a) to have an anagram f a name  (b) be  the service of Voldemt but eventually manages to save the day whout completely squashg you-know-whoThe good news is that while not abong her idiom  The Goblet of Fire JK Rowlg has allowed herself to drt loose of these mogs  evolve Harry's wld: the wizardg universe is signicantly dferent at the end of this book than  was at the begng You couldn't say that about the first threeWh each book Rowlg has developed her lerary aspirations: the Goblet of Fire is pretty baroque compared to the roughly-hewn Philosopher's Stone I thk she manages to stay the right side of the self-dulgence le though:  remas to be seen whether Rowlg can resist the temptation to stray over  next time roundRowlg's stctive gt f stytellg is generally absbg but is by no means perfect: at the end there is some fairly ham-fisted dialogue that exists only f plot exposion While she isn't the first wrer to lean on this particular shovel (Conan-Doyle's Dr Watson character existed almost exclusively to allow Sherlock Holmes to expla parts of the plot Conan-Doyle couldn't be bothered settg out properly) this doesn't mean  isn't a flaw Ultimately Harry Potter is a wonderful creation  such sales are an achievement which cannot be explaed away as a product of canny marketg  sheer fluke But this early on n can you properly gauge how Harry stacks up agast Bilbo Baggs  Aslan the Lion To my way of lookg at  that's the real testOlly Buxtonroughly-hewn Philosopher's Stone I thk she manages to stay the right side of the self-dulgence le though:  remas to be seen whether Rowlg can resist the temptation to stray over  next time roundRowlg's stctive gt f stytellg is generally absbg but is by no means perfect: at the end there is some fairly ham-fisted dialogue that exists only f plot exposion While she isn't the first wrer to lean on this particular shovel (Conan-Doyle's Dr Watson character existed almost exclusively to allow Sherlock Holmes to expla parts of the plot Conan-Doyle couldn't be bothered settg out properly) this doesn't mean  isn't a flaw Ultimately Harry Potter is a wonderful creation  such sales are an achievement which cannot be explaed away as a product of canny marketg  sheer fluke But this early on n can you properly gauge how Harry stacks up agast Bilbo Baggs  Aslan the Lion To my way of lookg at  that's the real testOlly Buxton
Well I purchased the book back  the summer when  came out wag impatiently f the Wter holiday so that I could really s down  sav this huge tome when I had some time off to do so properly!  It was wth the wa! Incredible that is was even better than I could have imaged  Simply rivetg  I love the way Ms Rowlg has brought children  adults back to readg She is an amazg wrer  I love the wld that she has created
This book you'll be reluctant to put down You can't resist   Sure rivals Ld of the Rgs! I got this book from my aunt as a birthday present  from the moment I read  I just can't fall asleep  eat my dner properly!Rowlg creates a new  wty plot-- woe whout the Quiddch! But I thk that the Triwizard competions are even me excg than the Quiddch matches  F those who haven't read the book yet you'll enjoy the part where Ron  Hermione have a spat--all because she had Krum f a date F most teens:  you want to have your best friend f a date don't take the person as a last rest! It was deliciously funny My sister my aunt  I are all wag f Year Five
This book defely lives up to all expectations It's fantastic! Although  is a b darker than the rest the book certaly is better You fd out all sts of thgs u never knew about Harry  about how magic wks The way Rowlg describes everythg  so much detail makes  all seem so real  believable F all u non-Harry Potter readers out there who are lookg f a great read i defetely reccomend this book Trust me u won't be able to put  down!PS just FYI the next Harry Potter book will be called Harry Potter  the Order of the Phoenix   will be released around November (along wh the movie)
Unftunately like many commercial successes Harry Potter 4 suffers from the dreaded &quotme is better&quot syndrome  Instead of the quick easy read that was a cnerstone of the first three books  the series &quotGoblet of Fire&quot dims by comparison--due maly to s molasses-paced plot development meerg subplots lengthy ( dare I say mostly irrelevant)narratives  overdosg of magic-speak  This book distguishes self from the first three wh s lack of pacg  Nearly 200 pages   the only compellg chapter was the first  Ironically  was that chapter--which was featured  one of the newsweekly magazes--that igally piqued my terest  Harry Potter  spired me to read the first three books  Image the disappotment upon fally readg book four  s entirety only to fd  lackg woefully  Gone is the charm of magic stead replaced wh a bludgeong of hyperbole  enchantment overkill  Then aga perhaps I am merely out of step wh society because I also became bed wh &quotSefeld&quot  wh most other commercial television series after the third season
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an extradary book!The plots are all terric they all have an effect of some st on all the characters  they are very creative And there are a lot of plots throughout the sty so that readers are not bed by readg the same old plot f the whole styThe characters are also great they are all dferent  many ways which is what makes them terestg They all have dferent thoughts  feelgs about everythg And Ms Rowlg uses unimptant characters from the other books aga as ma characters  this book which is greatAnd of course just about everythg  this book is absolutely dferent than anythg we know There is magic  everythg from classes to meals  we've never heard of a Quddch Wld Cup  Triwizard Tournament! The classes are all magic from Transfiguration to Charms to Potions to Defense Agast the Dark Arts And there are ws spells cauldrons  me!Overall Ms Rowlg did an excellent job wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire! The paragraphs above are reasons why this has become one of my fave books  I thk you will like  too  you read ! I can't wa f the next Harry Potter book!
I'm not gog to say that this fourth Harry Potter book is the best thg I've ever read because 's not  But J K Rowlg is  my list of top ten auths along wh C S Lewis J R R Tolke Orson Scott Card Terry Pratchett (why is only one of those auths American?)   others I am a great fan of J K Rowlg though  She has excellent comm over her wd choice  I love to read I get told &quotput that book down&quot probably m than most kids get told &quotturn that TV off&quot  I read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  one day (hey  was summer  school was out)I didn't md the book beg long even   did seem to drag at some pots  turns out later that some key elements pop up  seemgly irrelevant scenes  I love the way that Rowlg gives you absolutely no clue as to who the &quotbad guy&quot is  There are not many auths who would do that  I'd just like to say a few me thgs First: Rowlg never said the books were f children she wouldn't even let her own daughter read  alone Second: To any parents who say that the book is too dark take a look at what your child watches on TV   then re-thk judgg this book Third: To those who say that the endg could have been better  Yes of course  could have!

Excellent  I have read all four of the Harry Potter books  They are just great  Each book has 's own magestical tale of mystery  triumph  You won't be able to put them down  This series is dog wonders f kids makg them want to read  I can assure you that you'll want to read them over  over aga  They're just great  The character development is amazg  It makes you feel as  you are a student at Hogwarts  I strongly urge that you read ALL of the Harry Potter books
In this 4th Harry Potter book Harry Hermoe  Ron travel on platfm ne  three quarters to Hogwarts f their fourth year of wizardry trag but not befe seeg the Quiddch Wld Cup This year there is supposed to be a triwizard tournament where three wizards from opposg schools must figure out clues to their challenges  prepare f them However most of the students cludg Harry Ron  Hermione are dissapoted when they hear that only wizards that are 17 years old may participate because of the high death toll  past years Those who wanted to enter were to put their name  the Goblet of Fire   would choose the most wthy contender from each school When the wizards to be competeg are annouced  Harry's name is released as a fourth wizard even though he didn't enter his nameHarry has to face many challengesnot only  the triwizard tournament  but wh his classes  friends tooAlthough  is very long  still isn't very hard to follow  anyone who has liked the past books will enjoy 
I started readg Harry Potter on a whim just to see what all the fuss was about  I got hooked I can only recommend this  the other three  the series so far f anyone of any age These books will volve you  you can't wa to read each page And f parents you can share somethg wonderful wh your child by readg them together  dicussg the sties  I can't wa f books five through seven I hope the series goes on longer actually They are well wrten to keep the reader terested  volved That's the secret to these books  I highly recommend them to adults  children alike!
This book  my opion is the best book of all time It will be a classic f years to comeWhat's really amazg is that she made these thgs all  her head All the spells the type of magic rules  the pure evil of the charactersI've read all the Harry Potter books  now I listen to them wh my brother After a long day  really helps me calm down I recomend the tape  CD to everyone who has read the book  can't read  Jim Dale does a wonderful job(he's the reader)Another reason I thk this book is so good is because of the thought of havg the power of magic Humans always have loved to have power over thgs  this shows them  a fun way what  would be like to use magic  have that mch power  your hsI recomend this book to every age  anyone who is imagative
This book contutes the adventures of Harry Potter I believe that JK Rowlg did a good job when she wrote this book but  is not her bestThis book talks about Harry's fourth year  wizard school  the return of he-must-not-be-named!It is sure to keep your attention through out!If you have not read the book i suggest that you jump right on   get a copy!It is truly wth your time!
I thk Harry Potter books are defately over-rated! I mean come on! Who  thier right md is terested  a wizard at school wh a big scar on his head?! In my opion they just aren't terestg at all! It gets lots of publicy  goes straight to number one  the chart-  just doesn't deserve ! However well done to JKRowlg because she has probably made millions from  when she was just an average person-  just shows that anybody can do  whether thier books are rubbish  not!
What me can I say I guess the tle sums  up  This book is outstg
It surprises me that these books have caused such a ridiculous ruckus yet the Phil Pullman &quotHis Dark Materials&quot trilogy hasn't seemed to raise an eybrow outside of listservs (where they are enthusiastically discussed) NOTE: This is  no way encouragg any cricism of Pullman His books are simply wonderfulI feel badly that Rowlg has taken such heat f a series that contues to astound  Wh each book the wld she has created comes together  a much me cohesive fashion  Book 4 is notable not only f s novations  adventure ('s a bold move on Rowlg's part to have an entire school year wh no Quiddch matches at the same time  makes sense  keeps us from gettg tired of repetion) Another high pot is that Rowlg develops her sties  adds secondary characters from the other books to help the sty move fward  Did you thk you'd seen the end of the house elvesSirius Black Moang Myrtle  the Dements? Guess aga  Rowlg uses them  this book  terestg ways  By dog this Rowlg also makes each book an essential part of the whole  every sign is potg us fward to book 5Another strong pot of the book is the return of all of our fave characters  the newest developments  Is there some kd of romantic tension between Ron  Hermione? Perish the thought but Rowlg skillfully doles out soap opera hum  hr  balances  very carefully  Rowlg also doesnt spare her magic characters eher  F the past three books we kd of were spl along the &quotmagic good muggles bad&quot les this is feexcept every reader of the book (cludg Rowlg)is a Muggle At times  almost became embarrassg to see non-magical characters seen as lumpish dumb  slovenly  In this book we see that all the magical begs are not so perfect  pure eher most notably  a rather disturbg scene at the Wld Quiddch Cup matches where Muggles are hapless victims of a cruel prank This is good as  begs to erase the rather polarized les that Rowlg had developed  allows us to question our own black  whe beliefs (ie not every oppressed group reacts to oppression  a noble fashion)  Rowlg also gives us the sense of polical awakeng  Hermione as she sees the justice  the suation of the house elves  I am terested to see this suation expled me  other novelsThis book is so far the darkest of the lot  But Harry bravely faces these challenges (cludg an excg  darkly terryg climax) But don't let that dissuade you from readg this 4th book  The only real complat is that Rowlg is htg that she may wa 2 years to release the next book  I hardly fd this fair as the first three books were released all  the span of one year  2 years is too long of a wa  I thk a b unfair to her loyal readers  But we'll see In the meantime I may just beg to read the series over aga to kill time until the next book  I suspect I am not the first person to do that eheress victims of a cruel prank This is good as  begs to erase the rather polarized les that Rowlg had developed  allows us to question our own black  whe beliefs (ie not every oppressed group reacts to oppression  a noble fashion)  Rowlg also gives us the sense of polical awakeng  Hermione as she sees the justice  the suation of the house elves  I am terested to see this suation expled me  other novelsThis book is so far the darkest of the lot  But Harry bravely faces these challenges (cludg an excg  darkly terryg climax) But don't let that dissuade you from readg this 4th book  The only real complat is that Rowlg is htg that she may wa 2 years to release the next book  I hardly fd this fair as the first three books were released all  the span of one year  2 years is too long of a wa  I thk a b unfair to her loyal readers  But we'll see In the meantime I may just beg to read the series over aga to kill time until the next book  I suspect I am not the first person to do that eher
Like many families we bought one f our children  now we are all breathlessly wag each release Goblet of Fire was an unexpected delight as  is the best of the collection yetCurtiss De Vedre - Auth &quotThe Second Comg Of Age&quot
Unftunately  appears that Rowlg has been taken by the same spell as too many auths befe her She has gotten success  has fallen too much  love wh her own wds While the plot motivations  characters  this book are as sound as the previous ones  lerally takes twice as long to make the pot This book has as many cute asides  subplots as the previous three books put together It appears to have been wrten f the fans who are me  love wh the atmosphere than the plotHere's hopg that book five will get thgs back on track  keep the sty movg to a satisfyg conclusion
I can't say enough  Harry Potter Rules!  Anytime I feel like gog on an enchanted ride  I read a Harry Potter Book  Now I need the next one!  What to do?  I'm readg many other great novelsbut Harry takes me where no other book has gone befe  The auth is magnicentthe imagation is credible  I recommend this series to all ages  It is fun entertag  spellbdg
I thk that each  every one of Rowlg's books are fabulous She has true talent This book number IV has been my fave of the series so far I am wag anxiously f the V book I know  will be just as wonderfulI just want to say that while people have a right to voice their opions I thk that 's very idiotic  immature to claim that Rowlg's books are unsuable f impressionable children f fear that they might pick up on the wchcraft I believe that all of the parents who thk this need to trust their children  themselves If they believe that they cannot teach their children that wchcraft is not realist  mal then they are not ready to be parents I also believe that the wchraft that the characters use  these books is not evil  scary Children should know that 's all  fun The people who thk that these wonderful books are evil  promote lyg cheatg  stealg should fd a new book series May I recommend Dr Suess?
This book has so many twists  turns that you won't be able to put  downTherefe I give you an advice:don't start readg this book  the evengIf example ended up stayg up till 6am!I've read the book f 4 times already  only keeps gettg better  JKRowlg has an imagation you can only envyAll the ltle thgs(like the paper wh three sides)are well-thought  cleverBut the most imptant thgs  &quotThe Goblet of the Fire&quot are -naturally- the plotthe humour  the characters of the people    You-Know-who is of course back this time f realWe learn que a lot of HarryDumbledeSnape  all the others The only problem I have is:how on earth will I survive until the next book?
Like the previous three novels JK Rowlg does an excellent job on illustratg the fourth year of Harry's Hogwarts le However  is stg at the same level of a reader's enjoyment but  is about 400 pages longer than the other Perhaps too long
JK Rowlg has developed a great sty le  unfgettable characters wh the Harry Potter series  Each book brgs us deeper  deeper to the strange wacky  sometimes scary wld of young Harry  The fourth year at Hogwarts however has lost somethg - that feelg of youthful nocence  Harry  his friends are startg to feel the pull of the oppose sex  they all have dates f the Yule Ball a beautul dancg extravaganza at Christmas time  But the high pot of the book volves the death of a proment student  some very scary imagery wh regards to the &quotDark Arts&quot  This book is aga fantastic f the older set especially adults but please parents counsel your younger ones strongly  you choose to let them read this one!
This is a great book I have been a fan of the series maly f the way that  remds me of beg a kid f recapturg that sense of wonder that you beg to lose upon enterg high school  consider completely gone by the time you earn your BAThis book was dferent Yes  still fills me wh that sense of wonder tickles me wh clever  fun-soundg names  makes me nostalgic f childhood But there is a dark element to this book that the adult  me found deeply satisfyg Rowlg is on top of her game  this book   the progression of these books is any dication I would say that the next one is gog to be utterly amazgRowlg has crafted an trigug sty a host of fascatg characters (some old faves some new)  has done  all wh a magical zest that is irresistable She deserves all the praise she has received  me Anyone who can make children this exced about readg deserves an award!
This is an excellent book I have always liked these books  I thk this is the best yetIt deals wh real emotions It also deals wh peer pressure which is very hard f kids Harry's age It is like books #1 #2  #3  is impossible to predict what will happen at the end THough this book is fantasy  is also very realistic  Harry is faced wh his biggest challenge yet The endg is what I have been predictg will happen sometime  this series though I really thought that Harry would overcome the problem  the same book that  arises I am not gog to say what the endg is you have to figure out what  is Furtherme I thk the people who say these books are evil  unchristian need to GET A LIFE!
There are a few pots that I want to get across  First no matter what I say I loved   I loved all 4 books (so far) so much I helped make a Harry Potter webse  All of these other reviews expla why 's so great  i agree  But  is misunderstood  JK Rowlg never tended f the book to be f young kids notice the age  is listed f even here on amazoncom  It really is much me mature than  seems  Teenagers will enjoy this book very much as well as younger children  I made my parents read  too  they expected  to be childish yet they both loved   Yes the plot is a ltle dark but not f the older readers who i thk  was tended f igally  Rowlg says that the plots of her future books will be even darkerSome people say that  is agast Judeo-Christian religion  I completely disagree  F those who say that a book focused on wchcraft promotes the wship of a devil is VERY wrong  Why?  Because wchcraft is a religion that's been around f thouss of years - the most popular fm beg Wicca  Wicca is actually a very peaceful nature religion that is  NO way associated wh Satan  And this book is just a nmal magical fantasy book  is not tryg to convert you nocent ltle children  Trust meThe book has had a lot of hype  's great but there are other books which are just as good that haven't gotten as much attention  Be warned that while most people love  everyone has dferent tastes  you might not  It ALMOST lives up to the hypeI give this book a 9/10
This book as well as the previous three is unbelievably excg  I am a teacher  read all four books to my class  When you get to the end of the book  is impossible to put them down  They are so creative  entertag  My class begs me to read me each day  I am so lookg fward to the next book This one really leaves you cravg f me  I am urgg my husb to read them because they are such good readg

As  by &quotmagic&quot JK Rowlg pulls out of her hat yet another of the seven booked Potter saga  This sty takes an terestg perspective  the young boy's le  This book is very pivotal f the series as far as plot is concerned  The book's tricate plot  loopholes make  hard to put down Charmg  delightful to read  seems great f all ages  But once one gets side the plot  predicaments that young Harry fds himself   may not be suable f younger children  Harry triumphs but how?  By lylg stealg  exhibg behavi that is lerally unacceptable  Bad aside  shows to children the imptance of friends  a strong will  determation  Despe the good though the bad triumphs  the ma le: Evil will w back 's power  take control  This is not what we want to expose our children to because  is not true
I've read all four books  so far this is the best one yet  It brgs everythg from Quiddch to creatures  even me seacrets together  magnies  f the reader  Addg to Harry's collection of magical thgs rangg from ws brooms  visible cloaks he recieves omnoculars as a gt which he watches the Quiddch wld cup through I've never read a book  liked  until I started readg the Harry Potter series  Every le is packed wh action  leaves the reader on the edge of his seat wantg to keep readg  I found myself sometimes not able to put the book down  If you lookg f action  adventure I recomend this book f all ages  I'm sure that you won't be dissipoted

The Harry Potter series are sties we read together as a family The sties are excg  entertag f parents as well as children Strong mal messages become pots f discussion ie loyalty honesty love belief  self &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is a darker tale yet s me serious themes are hled  a way that does not frighten children at least not my boys who are highly sensive Any concerns about the sties beg anti-Christian because of magical powers used by characters is  my opion greatly unfounded If read carefully you'll see that Christmas carols are heard durg the holiday seasons  goodness is found  characters (as well as evil  those choosg the &quotdark side&quot) These sties are a joy to read  share
I wonder what's wrong wh me sce the first book i can't stop readg those books JKRowlg is truly amazg I'm 26 yrs old  i love all of Harry Potter series Isn't that weird??? Well 's happeng to me And I wonder when is the fth book will be release??? And my only suggestion is  u never read Harry Potter books befe then don't u dare read  because  is too addictive
This is one of the best books that I have ever read I cannot wa until her 5th book come out! I also cannot express how wonderfully magnicent this book  all of her other books are but this one truly was the best one yet!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire beat all! In this fourth thrillg book by JK Rowlg Harry Potter encounters new people  strange places  The sty jumps smoothly from the Quiddch wld cup to Hogwarts  then to Ld Voldemt  Harry is almost not allowed to go to the Quiddch wld cup but his best friend Ron's' family comes  gets him from his harsh  cruel Aunt  Uncle  When he fally gets to the Quiddch wld cup he has the time of his le until the end of the tournament  It comes about that a few death-eaters (Voldemt suppters) wanted to have a ltle fun so they tture a muggle family f no reason  Their fun is stopped by a fahful death-eater who puts the dark mark  the sky  Harry gets out of this mess  fally makes  to Hogwarts  At Hogwarts he fds out that the mistry of magic is gog to restart the Triwizard Tournament between Hogwarts  two other wizard schools  There are to be only three contestants that are at least sixteen years old  But oddly a fourth contestant is chosen:  Harry Potter  This causes cruption  the school  Everyone thks he cheated  Even his best friends thk he cheated  Fally after two of the tasks he has to perfm his friends believe him  the rest of the school doesn't thk he put his name   When the third task arrives Harry  the other Hogwarts contestant Cedric Diggy fd themselves tied f first  They grab the trophy together  both are taken far away from Hogwarts where Cedric is killed  Harry comes close to beg killed  Voldemt has been wag on them ready to kill Harry after Voldemt gets a new body  Harry barely escapes  time to grab Cedric's body  get back to Hogwarts  I recommend this book to People of all ages!  These Harry Potter books are fun  excg  I am sure you will enjoy them too!
I'm 13 years old  I've read all four Harry Potter books At first I thought they were f ltle kids but then my friend got me started on them  f that I thank her The fourth book is probably the best book  the series so far I loved the twists  turns  the plots  the secrets that were reavealed about some of the characters Any person who likes to have a good time should read Harry Potter You can really get to the characters  fd at least one that you identy wh  absolutely love whether  be our hero Harry Potter himself  grumpy old Profess Snape (who happens to be my fave character!) I never read a book me than once but Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  the rest of the series are defely books I will be revisg aga  aga
The tle of the book I read was Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire by J K Rowlg  This is an adventure fiction book  The Ma characters this time are Hermione Ron Sirius Black Hadgrid  of course Harry  Now at the age of 14 Harry has only two me weeks wh his Muggle relatives befe returng to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  Yet one night a vision harrowg enough to make his scar burn which has Harry on edge  contactg his godfather  hidg Sirius Black  Happily the prospect of attendg the season's premier sptg event the Quiddch Wld Cup is enough to make Harry momentarily fget that Ld Voldemt  his sister familiars the Death Eaters are out f murder  This year there will be no Quiddch matches between Gryffd Ravenclaw Hufflepuff  Slyther Instead Hogwarts will vie wh two other magicians' schools the stylish Beauxbatons  the icy Durmstrang  a Triwizard Tournament Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests  Harry is one of the lucky contenders He passes the first test wh the summong charm summong his Firebolt the second wh gillyweed On the third test Cidic Digy helped him but when they touched the cup at the same time together they were telepted by a ptkey to the place of Ld Voldemt  the Death Eaters f Ld Voldemt to rega his power I would strongly recommend this book to anybody who likes long book wh me than 700 pages you have to be patient to get to good parts  when you beg readg the first chapter you will want to know why  is there because they mention Harry's name about one  twice at the end you see why

As a mother of 2 boys ages 5  10 I igally purchased the first book to read to them at bedtime  Now I am hooked  All of these books are wonderful  great f the imagation of the young  old  This book however is the best!  I thk JK Rowlg has outdone herself  I am not sure how book 5 can get any better  The details are so explici we feel as  we are right there experiencg all of Harry's mischief  fun  My sons are enthralled as I turn the pages  They are terribly put out when I say  is time f bed  Everytime we read another chapter they are just as entranced as the last  It is amazg how well they respond to listeng to a wonderful sty  This book also spired my oldest to become Harry Potter f Halloween  What a delightful imagation these books have unleashed  him

One question I've had that my two sons have shared is WHY  Harry is now a 4th year student at Hogwarts can't he do a simple transfmation spell to lose the hockey tape on his glasses? Although this specic question is not answered  the latest stallment certa aspects suggest the reasons!  Harry as anyone who has even slightly followed the saga by now knows is one of two contestants from Hogwarts selected to serve as champion  a contest that has long been shelved due to the danger between wizardg schools  There are any number of twists  turns along the way some predictable some not As almost everyone also knows by now a ma character dies  this volume  my son tried to tease me by suggestg whom  might be but like my son I will not spoil  f those who don't yet know  Rowlg does a superb job of givg enough leads to suggest any number of characters The whole cident though &quotdarker&quot as others have suggested is nonetheless hled  a dignied fashion f the younger readers of this book  The usual crew is here cludg Hagrid Dumblede Snape  Harry  pals wh some new &quotcast members&quot as well  My personal fave is the yellow journalist wh her magical pen who causes no end of trouble wh her dispatches  the Daily Prophet  As my son says &quotI can't wa til the next book comes out!&quot
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire There would be no use tellg you my name the topic is the book I read  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire that is  This book was my le f about a month well I don't know  you would go that far  But you get the picture  Th book is irresistably fascationg  I do not believe there is anythg like   JK Rowlg is simply a genius  It is one of those books that you believe you are    If you have never felt  I suggest you try is some time  When Harry rides on a broomstick to steal a dragon's golden egg  Oh I tell you 's like jumpg out of  eight sty buildg  Hogwarts school f wizardry is the school that Harry attends  Many thgs that are fishy  down right wierd go on here  Ld Voldemart an evil wizard rises to take control  Sounds spooky doesn't ?  Well you're right  Now I bet your wonderg who Harry Potter is right?  Let me tell you a ltle about him  He is an unusual kid wh a scar on his head  the shape of a lightng bolt  Sounds like a freak?  Wrong!  He is a great friend to anyone who is willg to be his  F stance when Ron Harry's friend gets teased f beg po by Draco Malfoy "the enemy"  Harry is there to back him up  Ever been  a bd like this?  He seems like a friend that I would like to have  My fave part is the conflict between Voldemart  Harry  This i what makes me the most exced  My heart races like a pummel hse  When Harry was entered  the Goblet of Fire  Makg him part of a wizard tournament  Voldemart tries to kill him  When he says" And now face me like a man straight-backed  proud the way your father died" "Now we duel"  That just sends a tgle down my spe  I love 
THE GOBLET OF FIRE IS HARRY'S GREATEST ADVENTURE YET  JK ROWLING JUST KEEPS COMING UP WITH FANTASTIC TWISTS AND TURNS TO HARRY'S BATTLE WITH &quot HE WHO CAN NOT BE NAMED &quot  THE LAST FOUR CHAPTERS ARE INCREDIBLE  I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO SEE WHAT HARRY RON AND HERMOINE GET INTO IN THEIR FIFTH YEAR  PS  I'M SO GLAD HERMOINE'S PRONUNCIATION WAS FINALLY EXPLAINED
Have you ever wondered what  would be like to image  be adventurous ?

To fd out me about what is gog to happen  this mysterious  magical bookYou have  to read the fourth edion of the  fourth edion of  Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire
Well everybody knows that Harry Potter is really entertag well-wrten imagative etc so I won't bother explag what was good about this book It is a good read at first 's really volvg  hard to put downBut what is WITH the endg? It makes no sense at all  by extension the entire book makes no sense After the twist endg the plot becomes an illogical mess! This completely rued  f me I can't like a book after realisg that the entire thg revolves around such a ridiculous oversight It frustrates  angers me far too much********SPOILER WARNING!********[If you do not want the endg revealed do not read the followg:]So what is this gigantic plot hole? Well the entire plot of this book is based on this competion called the Triwizard Tournament that Harry is  The conclusion of the competion is acquirg a trophy Various mysterious fces are wkg to ensure that Harry is allowed to the competion  ws When he grabs the trophy guess what? It's a ptkey that transpts him to Voldemt! Wow now we realise that this was why Harry was led to the tournament  why  was so imptant that he won Sounds good? No! It's not good at all! We know from befe that anythg can be made to a ptkey So why the trophy? Why not his toothbrush? Why not some rom object sent to him by mail? There's no reason at all f all the time  efft gone to makg him w the tournament The entire purpose of everythg  this sty could have been accomplished  about one page Harry opens package owl brgs him Harry touches whatever's side Harry is transpted Easy So WHY did everythg  this book even happen? Is Voldemt that dumb? Is he just a big drama queen? Does he want attention me than he wants Harry?********END OF SPOILER********So  conclusion this sty is absolutely ridiculous I would DIE to be able to ask Rowlg what on earth she was thkg how she could image this was any st of reasonable style And maly did she even thk about the fact that  makes no sense? But how could you overlook such a thg? How can you wre a plot so completely unjustied? There's not even an ATTEMPT to expla why anythg mentioned above was necessary This book completely offends my sense of logicThe previous Harry Potter books had fairly articial fced  somewhat ridiculous plot twists at the end which seemed to be gettg wse So I suppose even  the endg rus the logic of the book  IS the logical progression of the series That's not a good thg This is defely the last one I readlg what on earth she was thkg how she could image this was any st of reasonable style And maly did she even thk about the fact that  makes no sense? But how could you overlook such a thg? How can you wre a plot so completely unjustied? There's not even an ATTEMPT to expla why anythg mentioned above was necessary This book completely offends my sense of logicThe previous Harry Potter books had fairly articial fced  somewhat ridiculous plot twists at the end which seemed to be gettg wse So I suppose even  the endg rus the logic of the book  IS the logical progression of the series That's not a good thg This is defely the last one I read
My we  I just started readg these books this past year We've read all four out loud to each other  love them This book is defely settg the stage f the next three I can't wa to see where Rowlg takes !We're both Christians who take our fah very seriously The whole &quotwch&quot thg did slow us down from readg these books but now that we are--we love them! It's funny wches  warlocks  the wrgs of Tolke  CS Lewis never bothered me I'm not sure why they did here I'm glad I got over ! Rowlgs books are defely wth readg
~*This has to be the best book that has ever been wrten  The auth blends the concepts  keep the book makg sense wh a somewhat magical spice  This book though  is long is a very quick read  fun to re-read over  over aga  Hopefully you're familiar wh the other Harry Potter books befe you read this one otherwise  just may be a slow page turner  It DOES start out kda slow but after the third  fourth chapter  is THE book of the millenium  If you've read all the Harry Potter book except f this one GET THIS BOOK NOW*~
Harry Ron Hermoe  the rest of the gang are dog  aga  JK Rowlg's 4th book of the series Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire  The wrg doesn't simply lie there like  most dary books  jumps out to you  pulls you to a magic wld of wizards dragons quiddch  even You-Know-Who!

I loved the &quotChronicals of Narnia&quot by CS Lewis the &quotChronicals of Pryda&quot by Lloyd Alexer  other similar series as a child  They are magical  Now JK Rowlg has done  aga wh her Harry Potter series!  I love her wk as much as my ne-year-old does!  Beg able to see mals  values re-fced to children is wonderful seeg a child eager to pick up a book  this day  age is fabulous!  This series is a must have f any family
I had kd of heard about the Harry Potter books but never thought anythg of them  I really got terested when the fourth book came out because they had people on the news wag at 12 at night f the stes to open  Me  mom said we just had to get the books to see what was so great about them  The next day we bought the 1st  3rd  I loved the 1st  I am 19  have always disliked to read but I could not but these books down  I was amazed when I read all four of them  about a month  I thk anybody of any age will love these books  I love them so much that I am actually readg them aga till the fth book comes out
This book is hardly a &quotkid's book f adults&quot but rather the oppose  Parents might want to preview  as the endg may be a b much f some children  The character development is amazg   will leave you wantg me while beg satisfied at the same time  There are even some surprises  Get past the hype  evaluate the book on s own mers  s greatness cannot be denied  You'll never want to put  down Probably the best  the series  the wld of wizards wches  mystery
This is the best book so far! The mistry of magic has decided to start havg the tri-wizard tournament aga an all of the students at hogwarts that oar 16 years old can sign up however Harry's name is pulled from the goblet of fire as the fourth champion This gets all of the school mad at him because they all wanted to jo but couldn't  Cedric Diggy the other hogwarts champion who was chosen is a Hufflepuff  the Hufflepuffs rarely ever get any gly Harry's best friend Ron gets jealous   almost rus their friendship  The sty is very well wrten It was terestg to learn a b me about other magical schools  meet some new Characters JK Rowlg left off at just the right pot  the sty wh one huge end to tie up I'll be first  le to get the fh one!
When my mom gave me the first Harry Potter book i thought &quotboy this looks stupid&quot but i started to read  nevertheless First le i was lerally hooked I was under harry potter's spell So i read the second book thought &quotthis is even better!&quot read the third &quotwow this keeps gettg better  better&quot got to the fourth book   was the best of them all Harry Potter's wld is so vivid so fascatg the sty is so absbg 's like you're there  even though I know  isnt real  seems very likely that i could go to London  catch the tra to Hogwarts I love these books--I read this one over 700 pages  less than two days I have read every sgle one at least three times  English plus I'm wkg on the Fnish ones now I highly recommend  to all muggles wches  wizards alike of all ages--you miss out on a lot  you dont read Harry Potter's sty
This book was very greatThe Triwizard Tournament was the best partAfter this bookI can't wa f anyme of the three remag Harry Potter books!
Whether your a muggle  wch  a wizard a deatheater  anaur a 79 year  10 year old you will absolutely love this book!It's filled wh the usual Harry Potter plot twists  newcharacters some you'll love  others you wish would just bebanished to Azkaban You should defiantly read this book unless youhaven't read the other 3 (READ THEM FIRST!!)
This book was absolutely amazg  The best yet!!!  Istrongly recommend the HP series f adults  They're wonderfully mysterious charmg  thoughly upltg sties of good versus evil  I read book 4  two days just couldn't put  down  Rowlgs' references to mythological  lerary images shouldn't be missed  Durg the limed breaks I was able to takefrom readg I found myself re-evaluatg the various plot twists  probable red-herrgs  I can't wa f book 5 unftunately  isn't anticipated until Fall/Wter 2001
This book is very good I thk that  is very entertag  can keep you readg f hours The pages go by like you're readg nothg This book is dferent from all other books cludg the rest of the series In  Harry is picked to represent Hogwarts  a &quotTriwizard Tournament&quot that hasn't been held  over a century It is all about his adventures  this tournament  a zany new twist that I don't want to ru This is a very good book If you're a fan of the series keep readg!!!
I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER  I LOVE HARRY POTTER
What can I say? JK Rowlg has done  aga The fourth book  my opion is the best yet Much me suspensful  violent  seems as  you have reached the climax when you read the first sentance! A total twist  the endg wh Ld Voldemt comg to power aga Couldn't image any book beg better!
Ms Rowlg remds me of Madelee D'Engle - fresh igal ideas fantastic imagery good vs evil thematics  many terestg references to past lerature  play-on-wds  I know children must enjoy the well-developed characters  action - but as an adult readg this book I found all the nuances wonderful I recommend this to anyone who is fdg their current book club choices passe - this one will keep you up at night whether you're 10  50
This book is about a girl who has no mother  And this girl is Alice  She lives wh her brother  father  a house she justed moved  at Sliver Sprgs  Durg the summer she had changed a lot  And because of that she need a mother  a role-moldel  One day when they went to GAP to buy some clothes  her brother got her some pants to try on  was way to big  She tod her brother  he said that  was the smallest size he can fd  Then a GAP staff came  said &quotMay I help you&quot  Alice said that do you have smaller sizes f this pants  She said that these pants were f boys  Alice was so embrassed  So from then on she decided that she needed a mom  a role-model  In this sty she will tell you how sad  awful  is to not have a mom
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  She wres so marvelously about Harry  everyone that this whole book seems almost like a realy to me  Almost because the book ended  Anyway  is such fun seeg Harry grow up  havg his first crush dealg wh bullies  fights wh friends  Everythg that a nmal adolescent goes through  I simply cannot wa until the next book comes out!
Ok first a confession I'm not a kid I didn't brow this from a kid And yes I loved the bookFirst I am absolutely amazed at how many young people  students are readg a book of this sheer size Harry Potter is to be celebrated  f nothg else then spirg young people to readWh that said I have to say that adults will fd this a fun book to read as well It is credibly well wrten  has plenty of action  hum coupled wh transptg us back to the time when we were kids Its terestg how the auth makes many of the adult characters aloof  ecentric wh the kids solvg the problems  beg resourceful It's just like when we were all kids ourselves  thought we could take on the wld  solve all the messes created by adultsRegardless of your age you will be transpted to a magical wld wh a classic good versus evil battle exists wh mystery action  drama It's not wonder cildrenlike the book given how  taps to their imagation  creativyThe auth also has a fun play of wds wh the characters' names Sirus sounds like &quotserious&quot f the character that is always serious  grave Hermione sounds awful lot like &quotHarmony&quot  that's the role she plays as the maturg young lady who keeps tryg to fight f the underdog  mata the peace Crouch is similar to Grouch which he is pretty much through the entire book Harry himself seems to be named after &quotHairy&quot because of all the hairy suations he fds himself I know some conservative Christian groups opposed the book but I have to say that  really is just pla fun fiction The sty taps to children's imagation the way Superman  Tom Swt did f many adults growg up It's fun  should be read as suchI found the book to be immensely fun  a great way to connect wh children that I come accross every day Most of all  remded me of what beg a kid was like  brought back memies I have long fgotten but am grateful that they've returneds like  brought back memies I have long fgotten but am grateful that they've returned
What can I say but this book rocks!  If you have enjoyed Books I - III get ready f 700+ pages of excement  The end of this book is much me tense ( graphic) than the previous wks  So parents of young children may want to read  first so they know what their kids are readg  There are surprises upon surprises  this book  even though Quiddch takes a back seat  this one the TriWizard's Cup will me than satiate your desire f high-paced action  Rowlg also develops the characters much me  this book especially Dumblede Harry  Hagrid  Dumblede has always been somewhat of a mystery but the auth provides some new sights  background of this wonderful characterIt's defely a must read f fans of the series  you will not be disappoted
I read the other three  thought they were great  The same goes f the fourth book  It just seems to me that the books are becomg me realistic each time
When my friend gave me the Harry Potter book to read I looked at   thought she was sane  I read the first one  loved   I read them all  I loved each one me than the other  I loved this one because  kept on the edge of my chair  I wanted to read  all  one night  could have  I didn't have to balance  to keep me busy f one month  The tensy  emotion of this book really captures you  make you feel like you are actually there wh the kids at the school  This book makes you mad at the bad guys  sad when somethg sad happenes almost like you know these people personally  can feel what they are feelg  This book is one of the best books ever wrten  almost everyone loves these books no matter what type of book they like  This book actually makes you believe  magic?
When my mom first told me about dferent books beg wrten about a boy who went away to a magic school i acted  disgust  Then my fiends started readg   i fally read the first one  It was magnicant  My fave on was the Goblet of Fire  I read   3 days  I just couldn't put  down  It has a lot of action  advventure  excment  a part of  has love I recommend  to kids above the age 12
this book is fantastic everyone i know who has read them loves them  everyone else should read them the auth is very talented  the way she sculpts the sties addg seemgly unimptant details that late rpop up  future books (memebr scerers stone? remember how hagrid showed up to drop off harry on a mot bike  he siad he'd browed  from &quotyoung sirius black&quot? i'd fgotten that but come book 3) my school is not allowed to read them because some parents thk they're evil so now NO ONE can read them at school which is seriously unfair as they're all about FIGHTING evil not promotg  anyway they rock
I thk this is a wonderful book f young adults It is adventure whout any negatives
This is defly a good book  I am know as one of the laziest person ever who never reads a sgle book actually fished readg all FOUR of the harry potter books  two weeks  I tensionaly bought these books f my ltle brother  He is 7  I heard so many good thgs about this book so I bought  f him thkg that I am gog to read a couple of pages f him every night(yeah right)  After I started readg I just can't put  down  kept my terest from begng to end  I can't wa f the next book
I felt that Harry Potter #4 was the best  the series so far!!  The Harry Potter series are the best books  whout them I would not have not such a strong terest  readg so many books book!!  Harry Potter is really good   may seem long but you get so to the book that you fish like that(I'm not jokg)
I thk that this is defely a very good book  It really makes you want to read on  the action never stopsexcept at the end  I'm not gog to give anythg away but I will say that I thk the endg could have been a lot better  After the graveyard scene was over I thought that  was gog to get better  when I had fished the book I was left there wh my spirs down because of the endg  They never really settled the whole &quotgraveyard scene&quot dilemma  But I'm guessg  hopg that they will settle   book five  I'm also expectg that there will be a LOT of action  book five settlg the dilemma  I guess we'll see
I loved the sty  the fourth book but there was too much filler  I would recommend the book to people who REALLY love the other books  I thk JK Rowlg could have easily made the book at least 100 pages shter  There was a lot of repeatg  unnecessary parts  the book but the actual sty was just as good as her first 3!
JK Rowlg's Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is her best book yet  The 700 page masterpiece doesn't contradict s self from eher of the other books  I happily re read the series  yet aga I couldn't put the book down  When I misplaced  when I was only half way through readg  f the fth time I was touchy  angry that I had lost   Book four is a joy ride that you can enjoy time  time aga  And f a last thought When is book FIVE comg out?
My mother  law got these books f my son to get me terested  readg  boy did   he now whats me to read them all the time  I fd myself readg ahead to see what happens next  I have fished all 4 books  loved them  I can not wa f the next one
I've always aded readg but anyme I have trouble fdg the time to read f my classes  All the Harry Potter books are enchantg but this fourth book has completely drawn me   I bought  the day  was first released  fished   8 1/2 hours (not consecutive)  I couldn't st that I had to go to wk--I just wanted to keep readg  It is much darker than I would have expected  I knew someone was gog to die  I knew that a ma character couldn't be killed but I wasn't expectg Cedric to fall out of the style so quickly  I'm almost 18 years old but I love these sties  They're easy to read enjoyable  I have a few friends who thk they should be banned  I love to argue this pot wh them  These sties conta some excellent lessons  as f the non-Christian arguements the characters observe Christmas  Easter  Religion is NOT beg depreciated   may not be the focus but  slides  wh ideas of patience trust  goodwill  As f the topic of &quotwchcraft&quot   children don't know the dference between fantasy  realy they need to be taught--NOW  Perhaps younger children should only read these books wh the participation of their parents  Parents have some fun wh this opptuny to be wh your children  Talk to them  They can underst the concept of pretend  you troduce  to them  I ade these books  loan them to my siblgs  friends  They can be terestg conversation-starters  I give a high recommendation
While beg an adult  this book as the three previous volumes beg supposedly f children I was once aga tryg not to read the book to fast  This volume while  keepg wh the past ones f the magical nature of creative ideas was a b me dark  gloomy to me me so f younger children Nonetheless  was que entertag  wth the read
Fally the long awaed fourth book  the Harry Potter series is out  It's Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts  He's eagerly awag to get to Hogwarts just so he won't have to deal wh his muggle parents  When his best friend Ron Weasley asks him  he wants to go to the Quiddch Wld Cup he can't refuse   But when he gets there somethg happens that will affect his 4th year majly  This is a must read f Harry Potter fans
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an excg  fascatg book It is filled wh adventure fantasy  has some thgs about friendship I reccomend this book to people who don't get nightmares after readg somethg scary It is educational f kids because  teaches them the dference between good  evil I thk this book is the best JK Rowlg has a lot of talent as a wrer It has actually spired me to wre myself I hope this book also spires other people to wre books Thank you f readg this review

I thk that f what  costs  how big i twas befe  came out this book wasn't as  goodas i thought i twould be I thk that the first book was defatley the best I would reccomend this book to children 10  older It defetly has some mature parts
The book exples themes that smack of Judeo-Christian maly  the same way that CSLewis  Gege Lucas have engaged us earlier on The gredients are mostly brilliant though a few of the characters  crow-bar plot explanations left the md questiong Such is le What do you want out of a book? Are you a child  an adult? The belief that only children grow is as much a myth as the beautul wld Rowlg creates  her books Adults  children benef from the simple  that is that le  whatever wld can be approached wh fgiveness  posivy I enjoyed the creativy wh the book  I love followg the events that go on It spans every age-group though many thk  sus children We can learn a lot from children  Rowlg ves them to develop wh Harry  this book Her role as a gentle educat is at s most potent  the fourth part  I don't md  beg so at all
This book is one of the best ones yet  this series of magical books JK Rowlgs has aga transpted the reader to a wld of wizards wches mystery  trigue Makg this book like all her others hard to put down If you enjoyed the others this is a must have f your Harry Potter collection!
I love this book I mean I'm 18 years old  I never use to read until one day I had to read a book of 250 pgs  me so I went to the ste  my cous said &quothey Chad why don't you buy that book right there called Harry Potter&quot so I ended up buyg   ever sce then I have never wanted to put  down It has taken me two weeks to read the third  fourth year which I wish  would have taken me longer so that I could have enjoyed  me Now that Ld Voldemt is back I can't wa f the fth year So what I'm tryg to say is that I thk that  is a good book f kids just because  is an attention grabber which will make kids me terested  readg like  did f me Thank you JKRowlg f creatg Harry Potter
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best of the series This novel conta darker style than other three  lots of thrillg  twist events come one by one the Quiddch Wld Cup the Dark Mark the Triwizard Tournament return of the Ld Voldemt fight wh Voldemt Especially after Harry escapg from Voldemt the style seem me excg than ever befe I can't wa f the fth one Well done! Miss Rowlg you have made a classic leagend that generations will talk  read about Harry Potter  this century  fever

I don't mean s bad because I didn't give  5 stars  The book is yes pivotal!  But 3 is still better 2 is better than 1 3 is better than 2 but 3 is better than 4  HOpe you got that!

Harry Potter does  aga!  He triumphs over evil  ws our hearts but this time the evil is far me sophisticated  sidious than befe  The dreaded  feared Ld Voldemt fally returns   his hideous  revoltg fm strikg terr  the hearts of all the magical wld  the readers as well  This book is me sophisticated than the other three because  deals wh complex mal  ethical issues as well as troduces the concept of an evil so vile that even a universal good  nocence is hard pressed to combat  conquer   However the book because of that very complexy is me terestg  thought provokg than the others  Perhaps aimed at a b older reader Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire returns us to the magical wld wh a vengeance as once aga the reader immerses himself  the characters creatures  circumstances of this new wk The fces of good  evil clash as befe but we see Harry  his friends facg ethical dilemmas previously unencountered as they get older  receive me advanced magical trag  The qualies of friendship loyalty  responsibily are strongly presented here as Harry  friends face challenge after challenge  They are also faced wh  ethical decisions that come wh experience  matury  And the bottom le is how hard  will be to wa f the next stallment to fd out what happens next!
I thought that this was one of the best sequels to the harry potter collecton yet It is one of those books that keeps you up ALL night readg  leavg you  suspense as from what is gog to happen next I thk Harry potter is an Excellent book not only f children but f all ages as well It puts you  some st of fantasy wld that your md donsent want to leave  you at times wish that you would be part of that unique wld I thk that one of the greatest thgs about these books is that they let you picutre thgs as you want to The book st of comes  tact wh an imagtive/creative part of the md  lets you see thgs as you want to Thats why i thk that  is so great that there isnt a movie because the movie would just kill everyones own perspective as to what this book is supposed to mean All  all i thk this book is great  recomend  to all

I am a very big fan of JK Rowlg's series of Harry Potter novels I was first exposed to this book  school where people were tellg me that the books were great  I had to read this one So I read all three  fally got to this one This book was great! This book starts of wh a creepy chapter that I thk could have been made a prologue stead of a chapter whatever The book then turns right back to the nmal where Harry is found at the Dursley's house He goes wh Ron  Hermione to the Quiidch Wld Cup where he meets VERY impotrant people He is then shipped off to Hogwarts on the Hogwarts Express where he unftunatly meets the hrible Draco Malfoy When he gets to school there is news that Quiddch season is canceled  the Triwizard tournament will be hel I thk I'll stop here  not give away the plot Please read this book  don't be timidated by the size of  You'll love this book Happy Readg!
What a terric book! Rowlg delivers once aga  There is so much that I like about this book I dont' know where to startFirst lets start wh a mi review  As the book opens Harry is headg off the the Quiddch Wld Cup Ofcourse when he's there somethg happens  's lead to believe that he-who-musn't-be-named will show up soon  As Harry gets set f his 4th year at Hogwarts he soon learns that Quiddch will not be played this year Instead a new contest will be held Triwizards Tournament&quot This is when a couple of Wizards Schools meet (at Hogwarts this year)  one from each School is picked by the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot Harry is to young to be entered but that last name that the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot sps out is our fave wizard Harry Potter  Now who could have put  Potter's name? Was  Snape? Skeeter  Could he do that? You'll have to read to fd outI liked the character of Moody What a great character  I also have been impressed wh Hermoe  She is my fave characterWhat I like is how all of the books flow to each other  how they all srrg board off each other  This book is a b darker than the rest What makes this darker is that fact that there is a murder This isn't spoilg anythg Rowlg made this known befe the book came outWhat also draws me to the series that that we get to know me  me about each of the characters as the books come outI highly suggest that you read this book  Rowlg has a genius md   can easily be seen
Too long too dark! Not f f kids below 16!  I am disappoted from Book 4 Book 1+2 were compact sties givg a certa posive view to the reader May funny passages compensated the message of the non-ideal wld  which Harry too lives This is not the case wh this book Although twice as long the passages are longwded whout much fun partly implausible This book is even f adults tough I cannot recommend this book f children sce albs are guaranteed In contrast to the fmer books Harry now escapes not because of luck AND his abilies but only because the Bad (tm) now eher wants too  makes big blunders The last showdown wh the impost is like a cheap crime novel  which the bad guy talks  talks till fally the police turns up at his back I assume that Rowlg overwks herself  wrecks her creativy  that her truely magnicent first books just needed time to grow I also f the first time had the feelg that Rowlg will wre a long-breathed 7book-series although she has blocked many future options f the sty  book 4 After this book I am sry to say that I WAS a fan of Rowlg All parents please read this book BEFORE you give  to your children ( don't buy   that's still an alternative --))
I love a book that keeps me up all night till I fish   All four books are great I was hooked after the first page I have sced gotten all my adult friends to read the series  Have yet to meet someone who doenst like HArry Potter  Book 5 cant come quick enough till then Im readg what I can to fill  the time
The problem wh the Harry Potter series is that they are startg to lose their freshness The first book was strikgly igal After this the plot grew me terestg  Book 3 but this book doesn't do that much to advance the rather complicated plot  Voldemt's rise is left as an omous ptent f the next booksBy book 4 Rowlg is startg to run out of steam I suspect The imagation is growg a ltle less vivid  the fm is growg predictable The book is still a fun romp But s startg to paleAlso Rowlg does a really bad job of creatg a feelg of menace wh Voldemt The begng chapter is almost farcical- the evil badguy rubbg his hs together  schemg wh his crgg sidekicks Also by this time I've grown tired of all the stard teacher characters- the usual evil Snape stern Mrs McGonagall  the wise but rather whimsical Dumblede One wants to see me development wh the peopleAlso these books are not really adult's books They are fun f them to read But they are defely aimed at children they refuse  are reluctant to deal head-on wh themse like betrayal love  death (Cedric Diggy a ma character? ha And he's the only death)Anyway  you're a Harry Potter fan you should pick this book up but  you didn't like the series don't contue F me the series is begng to fade just a ltle
First of all as many people know the Harry Potter books are wonderful  Instead of followg the hype realize how the auth's style of wrg affects the book  makes  greatWhat lerary devices she uses such as alleration  flashbackThis book is great because when I read  I can relate to the thgs i'm learng  my english class  JK Rowlg makes you feel as  you could become one of the characters  wish you could go to HogwartsI've heard that a lot of schools are banng Harry Potter books from school readg lists I had to read &quotCall of the Wild&quot by Jack London  found  to be very violent w/ a lot of ge  We are allowed to read that because  is a &quotclassic&quot but yet we can't read Harry Potter because  talks about flyg broomsticks  funny magic spells  I mean come on!  How ridiculous is that!  Maj league spts are me violent than Quiddch  And how are flyg broomsticks offensive?First of all because of the hype people thk that kids ages  3-8 can read  be read to  Maybe  wks f some kids but half the stuff I really do not thk they would underst  Its a young adult book me along the les of 9-upThank you f readg what I have to say
Harry Potter is the hero that children need  He always sticks to his prciples  fds himself up agast evil at every turn yet he never gives up  Children need someone like this to look up to  There are no evil saygs  spells comg out of Harry's ws not even when he is up agast the dreaded &quotHe Who Must Not be Named&quot  Clearly the people who thk he is a bad fluence  encouragg evil acts need to go back to school  learn readg comprehension skills  The whole series has not only shown my child the joy of readg but also understg plots  the dference between good  evil  He has someone to cheer f  Readg these sties has been a lot of fun f the family  we look fward to the next one
I don't like the reviews that call these 'the kid's books f adults'  They may have been true f the third book but the first two were no me 'f adults' that 'Charlie  the Chocolate Facty' is  They were defately children's books  They were particularly good children's books  like most children's books enjoyable f adults to read This fourth book is most defately not a children's book  A better way to describe  would be 'an adult's book that children will enjoy' This book is possibly one of the best I've ever read  Rowlg I'm convced is eher an credibly brilliant wrer  me than one person  The characters she has established  the previous books really blossom  this book  Snape  particular I look fward to seeg  future stallments What really made this book great was how real the emotions are among the characters  I'm not ashamed to adm that I was almost  tears when Hagrid said to Harry 'Yeh did as much as yer father would've done an' I can' give yeh no higher praise than that' Read this book  I can give  no higher praise than that
Me complex  me wk to read than earlier stallments Book 4 shows the auth's vision  will entice adult readers to stay f the next three books An action-filled fish is deed a new begng  the battle agast the dark arts Good job
Who says Harry Potter is just f kids? Many many adults have read Harry books  loved them I'm a self-proclaimed Harry addict! JK Rowlg's books are pure enjoyment They're easy to read have great character development  entertag sties   best of all they keep gettg better  better! I can't wa until the next one comes out
JKRowlg has out done herself aga wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire  is extremlly fun to read Good plot  good wrg get this  the other 3 because they are very entertag I have a extra copy of the 4th book i am sailg   f $1500 + s&amph  anyone wants a copy email at ababab1234@hotmailcom nothg is wrong wh the book page wise
This was a great book that was marvelously wrten I absolutely can't wa until the fth book coms out!!
I am 17 but I really like Harry PotterI have read all the books  this is my faveIt has a brillnt style  a brillant  sad endg
As is the case f all great begngs the sequels tend to to become weaker It's natural because the later versions are built upon the igal foundation A version up certaly but never a complete change that awes the readers First goblet of fire doesn't play much role  the book not a likely cidate f becomg the tle of the book Second much of the ideas of Rowlg's are now becomg repetive  new ones are certaly not the magnude of the previous volumesThird the fmat of the book has become so familiar that you can almost feel what's gog to appear next Fourth a great detective-like sty should give readers chance  a rational guidance to solvg the clue Rowlg never gives readers such opptunies The result of the book might be surprisg but lacks the rational flow as to why Triwizard Tournament was necessary why goblet of fire is such an object of fuss why Cedric should die  why Voldemt should go through such deal to relive aga But most imptant of all is wh Harry himself An dary boy as he is he is nevertheless never given any special power  special skill that will necessate him to become a powerful wizard  many sequels to come And even  he were given such power afterward  would certaly look awkward In a wd Harry is becomg rather bg
I liked this Harry Potter book because  lets a character that you get to know well be killed  I thk this makes the book much better because you are not happy  magic l the whole time  I can't wa f the next book to come out  I hear  is supposed to be even darker
I'm 32 years old  igally bought these books f my fant son thkg (wh all the hype gog on) this might be cute to read to him at night We started wh one chapter a night but after the first two nights I couldn't wa any longer  read  all the way through  Then I got my husb to read them  We loved   were hooked!  JK Rowlg has a wonderful wrg style that both children  adults can enjoy  The children characters are easy to relate wh at any age  A great book f parents  children to enjoy TOGETHER!
Yup-this book was a turng pot  the ever-popular Harry Potter series A darker turn addg shades to everythg we thought we already knew about Harry's wld but neher too dark n too convoluted In my view  remaed refreshgly nocent f a sty about young teenagersI'll adm that I thought the first hundred  two hundred pages of the book were slowbut watch out wld! Ms Rowlgs strikes aga wh new characters that become as fascatg  as hysterical as the old onesBartie Crouch the Mistry wizard wh a fatal soft spot nobody would have suspectedBertha Jks a missg Mistry wch wh a passion f gossip that could be the key to Voldemt's returnMad-Eye Moody the battered new DADA struct who isn't afraid to bend the rules  knows all too much about the Dark powers that want Harry deadCedric Diggy the Headboy wh a talent f beatg Harry to what he wants mostRa Skeeter the journalist wh a flare f the wst kd of tabloid journalism  ways of gettg her scoop on HarryThe old characters too take on new terest as Voldemt's past Reign of Terr begs me  me to affect Harry's present  polarize loyalties Why does hapless Neville Longbottom know so much about curses?

As an 8th grade English teacher I enjoy readg children's lerature often I fd 's better than what's out there f people my own age!  I have found all of the Harry Potter books absbg I kept readg well to the night just to see what happened next  I am wrg this review to demonstrate to my students how they can wre their own onle book reviews  I thk 's a great real-le publishg opptuny
I enjoyed this book  couldn't put  down  Rowlgs has created a amazg fantasy wld that is tailed to childern but that can be appreciated by all ages  The problem is most adults over analyze everythg they read  so will never be able to enjoy the book the way a child would  To read this f maximum enjoyment just emerge yourself  doesn't matter what books  resembles  The sty  's characters have a magic  mystery that are completely their own  It is a fantastic sty that allows us to mix the magical wld of Harry Potter  his friends wh the common everyday wld around usI would like to say Thank You to J K Rowlg f creatg a topic that we can share wh children  Your books are sure to be timeless classics
I have read all the Harry Potter books atleast two times each  I been  a maj dispute wh various people over this topic that somepeople believe that Harry Potter should not be all good  Voldermt not be all evil  I do not believe that Harry Potter is all good  Voldermt is all evil  I also believe that JK Rowlg is a good auth  Harry Potter has some characteristics of an evil character Voldermt He can speak the language of snakes which was a maj characteristic of Voldermt  founder of the Slythers  That doesn't seem good to me  Voldermt does demonstrate a few nice pots when he is  fms of others Even though his tentions are bad he can do considerate thgs  I highly recommend this book to everyone because I know you will enjoy 
As you know Harry Potter a 14 year old wizard has always had his wk cut out f him This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts a school f scery  is mad because his fave spt quiddch has been cancelled Instead a triwizard contest that was closed because of the death toll has been reopened The age lim has been set f 17 but Harry's name somehow gets entered  now he has to play  Now Harry has to try  survive the series of events that are placed befe him Soon Harry starts to get the feelg that some one is out to hurt him to kill him Now wh the help of his friends Ron  Herimone he will try  w the competon If you enjoyed the other books by JKRowlg this book is sure to brg out the wizard side of you as you follow Harry through his fourth year at Hogwarts
I have loved all The Potter books but this one is truly the best by farIt deals wh many issues that maybe adults don't want children readg about(slavery prejudice death) but are imptant f tnem to understRowlg deals wh these issues  a way children can underst  hle(over 10yrs old) paves the way f some great values clarication discussions between parents  childrenI thk Harry is a perfect mix of nmal boy  precocious kid  You go Harry!
I really don't consider this book  the same league as the first three  the series The sheer size of the book allows Joanne Rowlg to clude much me detail therefe weavg a me tricate  fascatg sty New characters are bn  old favoures (cludg Dobby the house elf) revised The endg of the book is a lot darker than  any of the other three books  we see what Voldemt is really like  learn the identy of some of the Death Eaters   Despe a predictable mysterious villa (this time s Proffess Moody)  a rather slow start I love this book And Harry's hmones fally start to kick  Brilliant

This is an awesome book full adventure  mystery Im 13 but when I read this book  just absbs me  I can't put  down I feel like I'm actually there It's really very treagg  everyone I know reads Harry Potter I just hope that JK Rowlg contues to wre these books even when Harry's out of Hogwarts so we can read about what his job is who his we is ( maybe even Cho Chang )  all the other excg thgs  his le like fightg Ld Voldemt
This book is one of Rowlg's best The lenght of  makes  much me wth the money The charecters develop much me then  the previous books  she (the auth) disscusses issues like slavery  other thgs However  is still too much of a good  evil thg Volemt is all bad  Harry all good This made the book a ltle wse b/c a truly good auth would make the vill be st of good  the hero have a touch of bad None the less this book is defy wth the money f anyone I have fallen  love wh the books  so has everyone that I know I strongly suggest that you buy this book b/c you will be the better f   you read

I brought this book f my kid who didn't really want to read  I know nothg about Harry Potter other than all the hype One day I decided to pick up the book myself to see what all the hype was about Once I did that I couldn't put  down I thought this book was just f kids but I believe teens  adults will enjoy  as well I believe we all have a ltle adventure/fantasy spot side of us We all would like to fly solve mysteries  be the hero once  a while This book took me away from a lot to the daily hustles  bustles of day I found  a great get awayAND IM A GROWN MAN :)I guess we all should get  touch wh the kid  us from time to time The plot was good   held my attention Just by readg I know  is bound to h TV  the movies soon I will probably read the books pri to this one as well Your kids should love   maybe you as well
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a most read  Frfom start to fish the book has rythm  a good plot  all the qualies of a good book  No book has ever made me feel so volved befe  The book was so amaz that  seemed like I was gog through the events wh the characters  The plot of the sty is:  Harry gets caught up  a contest f the greatest student wizards  he has to go through all these events  contest  Someone put his name  the Goblet of Fire wh dicates who is  the contest  You have to be a certa age to be  the contest  Harry is not old enough but someone put his name  the Goblet of Fire wh uions that know one knew of  Harry has to compete agast Vict Krum who is a great Quiddch cup player  HE played  the Quiddch Wld Cup  was given MVP of the game  Quiddch cup is some st of a st of a spt that has a ltle b of soccer  football combed  Harry has to compete agast Vict who is from one school  Fleur Delacour who was a beuul girl from another school  Cedric who is from the same school as Harry  Harry's school is away from the people  as the Magic school calls the people muggles  The muggles do not fd wizard's very terestg  dislike anythg that has to do wh magic  There is a dark wizard name Voldermont who is out to kill Harry  Harry suspects that Voldermt is behd all his misftune  Harry's prciple is a great man who helps Harry out a lot  His name is Dumblede  You will have to read the book to fd out what happends to Harry  The book goes through triumph  defeat wh Harry  The book shows the thgs that happen  every day le between friends  The book always keeps you on your toes  you never know what is gog to happen next  I would suggest you read the first three harry Potter Books befe your read this one  It will help you underst what is gog on  the book  I have never read a book as good as this one  I recommend that you go to the book ste  get  now!

How does Harry Potter do ?  You thk he has done  all but then you read the next book  How does he do ?  I have read all the books so far  they contue to get better!

No doubt about  JK Rowlg's &quotHarry Potter&quot books DO get better  better wh each volume No 4 &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is gog to be a tough act to follow  I am already lookg fward to No 5I've never been able to see any mer  the opion that so-called children's books cannot be read  enjoyed by adults The Harry Potter series is a perfect example of fe lerature that can be enjoyed by all agesWh each book Harry  his companions age one year As they get older their perspectives ga  matury The wrg becomes me mature  keepg wh the characters' development Book 4  my opion is already at  above the readg level of some adults My husb  I have wked to cultivate rich vocabularies   we had to look up a couple of wds  the dictionaryThe books also take on me  me complex themes: Like the non-magic wld the wizardg communy has s prejudice -- expressed not  terms of sk pigmentation but of magical parentage (Wches   wizards who come from Muggle families are termed &quotMudbloods&quot by pure-blooded magic users) What better way to troduce children to the concept of prejudice   a way that makes abundantly clear that  is  wrong  excusable?Some of the mal issues expled by Harry  his peers are still beg wrestled wh by adults From Book 3 &quotHarry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot one such mal dilemma comes to md  -- When are extreme punishments appropriate  f what crimes?Somethg is noticeably dferent  No 4  comparison wh the three previous books -- f some reason the American publishers decided to leave all the Brish slang tact Generally I was able to deduce the meang through context but  you fd this dficult a query on &quotBrish English&quot turned up several dictionaries of Brish slang available through Amazoncom&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot marks a midway pot  the entire series planned to be seven volumes altogether The book also troduces themes that will carry over  a successive volume  volumes JK Rowlg has hled this well creatg a book that concludes the year's episode neatly but that raises compellg issues that this reader is eagerly awag further developments As I have said befe I do not feel Ms Rowlg's books promote the occult The fantastic circumstances of beg wches  wizards are there but the good characters really do embody many posive tras of humany These are still children however  they have the flaws  preoccupations that children of their age have naturally  Whatever the age of the reader these books have a great deal to offer  I strongly recommend themrry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot marks a midway pot  the entire series planned to be seven volumes altogether The book also troduces themes that will carry over  a successive volume  volumes JK Rowlg has hled this well creatg a book that concludes the year's episode neatly but that raises compellg issues that this reader is eagerly awag further developments As I have said befe I do not feel Ms Rowlg's books promote the occult The fantastic circumstances of beg wches  wizards are there but the good characters really do embody many posive tras of humany These are still children however  they have the flaws  preoccupations that children of their age have naturally  Whatever the age of the reader these books have a great deal to offer  I strongly recommend them
This was a very entertag  excg book  It keeps you wonderg  is the best book yet  JK Rowlg has out done herself once aga  blessed us wh this great book  Harry is faced wh another plan from You-Know-Who which succeeds  Two other schools come to Hogwarts to participate  a dangerous  possible death tnament  As Harry grows  fds feelgs  tries livg through a fight wh Ron he tries to stay alive  Wh You-Know-Who back to power will he survive another year at Hogwarts?

I had put up wh the hype f long enough  I gave   I bought all four books  read them one after the other  I hid the dustjackets so no one would guess I was readg &quotkid&quot books  But much to my OWN surprise -- I enjoyed them  It is a break from our everyday rushed serious nose to the grdstone existence to actually s down  read somethg simply f the enjoyment  Do yourself a fav -- buy the book  read   Then  you're too embarrassed to keep  on your shelf wh your REAL books -- give  to your kids -- they'll enjoy  just as much ( not me) than you!
I am 42 years old I kept seeg the Harry Potter books beg reviewed everwhere  I wondered what all the fuss was about  Well durg a very busy time at wk I bought the first couple of books  poured through them  It was the best thg I could have done  The imagation of the auth allows the reader to place themselves to the book  a vivid l where one would love to experience  These books are full of adventure hum  suspense It is pure joy to read  non stop fun  Plus she captures the emotions of a boy better than anyone could image After fishg the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot I wanted me  I may just pick up the first book  start aga Although this book was ment f a children of Harry's age group  allows grown-ups the feelg of youth
Harry Potter has always been my fave It is the best book of the century Once you start readg  you can't put  down There is not one part of the book that is not excg Harry is great He makes so much sense It just all comes alive  your head sometimes you don't know  your readg     The Harry Potter books will enterta people f as long as they are out
This is a pretty fun book This new teacher f dark magic called &quotmad eyed moody&quot comes to hogwarts The first time he uses magic is when Malfoy picks on Harry Anyway  was a fun book
This book was a wonderful experience to read fm begng to end  Like all the others  failed to disappot me despe beg a sequel  I also liked how  has set up a huge conflict not only between Voldemt  Harry but throughout the entire Wizard wld  I enjoyed the Wld Cup but wish  would have been a bigger presence  the book beg that  won't occur aga until Harry's out of Hogwarts  The one thg I thought lacked  this book is an amazg trip like the one the reader goes through  the end of Azkaban ( you haven't read  hold on to you seats you're  f a ride!)  However I don't know what I'm complag about this is another great book  wish I could fast fward to July so I can read Book 5
Every time I read a Harry Potter book I say &quotthere will never be a better book than that!&quot then I read the next one  i say  aga but this time #4  IS the best The Harry Potter searies are the best books I have ever read I can assure you no one will ever wre a book better than Harry Potter ANYONE  EVERYONE who reads this books falls  love wh Harry Ron Hermione Dumblede  all of the rest of them I've read them all multiple times  they get better every time In my opion 4 is the best  then 2 then 1 then 3 I wish I would wake up one day a wch image gog to Hogwarts!  But 's never happened so I'll just have to be happyy wh beg a Muggle  wag untill #5!
Very resourceful imagation is what makes Harry Potter (All parts!)an amazg pleasure to read Beg a very frequent reader I have to say that Harry Potter really got me gog The amount of detail wh which J K Rowlg has created the wld of wchcraft  wizardry makes you wonder   really exists At the age of 24 I am certa that this kd of imagation is not bound by age Quiddchthe mistryYou-Know-Whothe triwizard tournamentall of  Book 4 is yet another masterpiece! Beg almost double the size of the previous books  was still not long enough to satisfy my hunger f me  I among many other Harry Potter lovers cannot wa till next July f Book 5
&quotHarry Potter Mus a Certa Flavour&quot  by Peter H Gleick (&quotNew Yk Times&quot July 10 2000)  BERKELEY Cal -- My family like so many others was exced about Saturday's release of yet another  Harry Potter book But although there are many legimate reasons f praisg the series -- the excg  plots the new young readers beg drawn to books the qualy of the wrg -- I am disappoted about  one thg: the decision by Scholastic publisher of the American edion to translate the books from  &quotEnglish&quot to &quotAmerican&quot Scholastic even went so far as to change the tle of the first Harry Potter book  from &quotHarry Potter  the Philosopher's Stone&quot to &quotHarry Potter  the Scerer's Stone&quot Why? Were  the eds wried that some people wouldn't buy the book because they couldn't underst   s  igal language? Were they concerned that some children would be confused by new wds f  otherwise familiar objects  actions?  I like to thk that our society would not collapse  our children started callg their mothers Mum stead  of Mom And I would hate to thk that today's children would be frightened away from an otherwise  thrillg book by readg that the hero is wearg a jumper stead of a sweater  Are we afraid that when presented wh new vocabulary children will shrk away? Or that alternative  spellgs of previously known wds will make children ( adults) suddenly start spellg thgs wrong  sendg school test sces fallg?  A careful readg of both the English  the American edions of &quotHarry Potter  the Scerer's  Stone&quot reveals three kds of substutions The first are spellg dferences: gray f grey col f  colour flav f flavour pajamas f pyjamas recognize f recognise  the like  The second are dferences  common wds  phrases: pch turns to field sellotaped to taped  ftnight to two weeks post to mail boot of car to trunk of car lry to truck  The third are metamphoses of truly English experiences  objects to somethg dferent but  distctly American: crumpets to English muffs f example (a particular odious change  my opion)  My two sons didn't have any dficulty understg the Brish version of the book sent to them by their  aunt  London  I adm to occasionally offerg the meang of a new wd the first time  appeared but don't we do that  wh every book we read to our children  help them read to themselves?  Do we really want children to thk that crumpets are the same as English muffs? Frankly readg about  Harry  Hermione eatg crumpets durg tea is far me terestg to an American than readg about  them eatg English muffs durg a meal  Are any books immune from this kd of devolution from English to &quotAmerican&quot English? Would we s  back  let publishers rewre Charles Dickens  Shakespeare? I can see  now: &quotA Christmas Song&quot  &quotA Sty of Two Cies&quot &quotThe Salesman of Venice&quot  By protectg our children from an occasional misunderstg  trip to the dictionary we are  pretendg that other cultures are  should be the same as ours  By sistg that everythg be Americanized we dumb down our own society rather than enrich   As f Harry Potter's latest adventures my children  I will wa f the Brish version comg by mailweeks post to mail boot of car to trunk of car lry to truck  The third are metamphoses of truly English experiences  objects to somethg dferent but  distctly American: crumpets to English muffs f example (a particular odious change  my opion)  My two sons didn't have any dficulty understg the Brish version of the book sent to them by their  aunt  London  I adm to occasionally offerg the meang of a new wd the first time  appeared but don't we do that  wh every book we read to our children  help them read to themselves?

There are lots of reviews on this book sayg how &quotanti-Christian&quot this book is  If you thk that way you don't have to read   That's all  What about other books about magic?  Let's see What about &quotThe Lion The Wch  The Wardrobe?&quot  They have loads of magic  mystery but no one seems to call them &quotsacreligious&quot  I thk people are just lookg f somethg to compla about  What about how these books &quottry to push children to jo the occult?&quot  No me than &quotGone wh the Wd&quot tells us to take up slavery  &quotLd of the Flies&quot tells us to let our evils out  kill each other  The Harry Potter books are just books that try to strike up the imagation  children that lies dmant due to the fact that television seems to take up a lot of a child's time  If people would thk about  these books have gotten a lot of children to readg which is a good thg  If you have a problem wh such activies then don't read the books  It's as simple as that  Or you can read these wonderful books  let JK Rowlg share her tales of adventure wh you
I will tell you know  you liked the other Harry Potter books then I URGE you to get  But let me warn you  might be kda scary to some kids who don't like murder  stuff that is considered bad Some of the wds  here are a propriate  should not be said any where So I warn you parents  you want to get this book f your child only get   you don't md cuss wds beg added to your childs language
Will Harry redeem us? The answer is sadly no There is neher God n Easter  these books though there is Christmas  the wizards appear to have an satiable appete f food sweets nectar chess  spt(?) There is no sex to speak of other than the blushg engagements of wizards of every age There is no self-knowledge n is there quiry to purpose However I have read these books wh real enjoyment chapter by chapter to my children who are aged six eight  ten  we look fward to the next stallment The plots are fast-paced the people terestg though stereotypical  the events are rivetg But  the context of redemption the thematic content is not threateng to our mals ambions  self-image These books are not an explation of good  evil Harry is a cardboard character  we like him because even though he is meek we know that he will her the earth just as we ourselves hope to Who then is Voldemt?  Is he evil? He kills  ttures f pleasure  even me appallgly he ttures f pleasure  then kills f bedom But this Voldemt  knows a greater me visceral fear than anyone else  the chronicles (see the "Goblet of Fire")  apparently what this is "All About" is that Voldemt wants only one thg immtaly he is afraid to die   his quest f immtaly he must create a hell on earth f all otherwise livg creatures Only Albus Dumblede  the brilliant  enigmatic Headmaster of Hogwarts School is signicantly  his way as is Harry Potter who may pass f Everyman of courage justice  peace The rest of the planet lives  fear of Voldemt as "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named" Havg taken us this far havg engaged the entire wld I pray now that Ms Rowlg will fm us of who we are  of our place  the scheme of thgs There may be much to be learned from these books  as a sequel may I suggest the Old Testament Prophecy of Daniel?
I haven't been this entranced wh a series sce I read Tolkien back  the early 70's  While not as achgly beautul  heartbreakg as the Ld of the Rgs this series defely has earned 's place  great novels of fantasy  J K Rowlg has created a great wld f her characters to exist   There is a lot of humour  these books I am totally entranced of the whole idea of Hogwarts a school f young wizards  The details are so great the ghosts who roam the crids the pictures that have movg people  them Moang Myrtle Diagon AlleyQuiddch  I absolutely do not like spts but I love readg about Quiddch This fourth book is darker  tone but Harry  his friends are also gettg older  If you like a great adventure wh fantasy elements  a helpg of humour read these books  If you're not a kid don't wry you don't have to be a kid to enjoy these  I cannot wa f the next book to come out!
This is the fourth book  the phenomenally successful Harry Potter series about a schoolboy wizard I  many other fans eagerly waed f   I am pleased to say that  does not succumb to the law of wseng sequels (as is so often the case wh popular franchises)   is as good  not better than the first three booksThis fourth sty has a darker me complex tone than befe Harry Potter is now fourteen years old   his fourth year at Hogwarts School wh his friends Ron  Hermione He is growg up  maturg - gone is the wide-eyed annoygly precocious youngster from the first novel  film  the series In this fourth book we meet a sullen often angry teenager who is frightened  confused (especially about girls)  haunted by nightmarish visions of deathLots of dangerous battles are fought (described  pretty violent detail)  as mentioned he starts to take notice of the oppose sex (one girl  particular called Cho Chang - catches his eye) F reasons I won`t go to here this plot pot struck a chd wh me as  contaed some parallels wh an all too brief friendship I had shared wh a girl at collegePlot pots such as these make his character me realistic  show us Harry is not just a `wizard` He is also a regular teenager wh human problems that everyone faces relatg to le love  growg up somethg the readers (dependg how old they are) can relate to (I certaly can)Lots of people say Harry Potter is just a kids` book but I disagree Like the best Disney cartoons  animated features the book wks on a number of levels - as well as beg an excg adventure there are some references  funny jokes that will amuse older people F stance one character is called Ra Skeeter who is a repter f the Daily Prophet newspaper She will do anythg to get a good sty even  that bendg the facts exaggeratg  lyg This allows Rowlg to take humous pot shots at the Brish media  newspaper journalists of the gutter press a joke which adults  older children will underst but may well be missed by youngstersThere are also some parts that could scare young children (f example the rather grisly detail  which the fights are described)I thk the sty is really excg  the complex unpredictable plot will keep you wonderg what will happen next It`s much longer than the last book (the Brish release has over 600 pages!) but the sty is so good that once you start  s really hard to put downThat said the book`s length does turn out to be an issue sometimes Though I would be the first to cricize the early novels (Philosophers/Scerers Stone  particular) f perhaps beg too light  kiddy Harry Potter`s early appeal was combg fantasy elements wh a classic school sty  one tightly plotted package On the whole Goblet of Fire is excellent but  does have a tendency to meer as we move away from that simple templateI found all the nonsense about the Quiddch Wld Cup (a reference to the 1998 Football Wld Cup  France perhaps?) un-necessary after a while f example which could have been cut out  at least shtened -  we would still have been left wh a fe piece of wk whout disruptg the flow of the sty  my opionOn the other h one must admire the auth f tryg to brg me depth to her characters  flesh out their personas which draws the reader to Harry`s wld makg  seem believableOverall I thk this is a truly `magical` styg to take humous pot shots at the Brish media  newspaper journalists of the gutter press a joke which adults  older children will underst but may well be missed by youngstersThere are also some parts that could scare young children (f example the rather grisly detail  which the fights are described)I thk the sty is really excg  the complex unpredictable plot will keep you wonderg what will happen next It`s much longer than the last book (the Brish release has over 600 pages!) but the sty is so good that once you start  s really hard to put downThat said the book`s length does turn out to be an issue sometimes Though I would be the first to cricize the early novels (Philosophers/Scerers Stone  particular) f perhaps beg too light  kiddy Harry Potter`s early appeal was combg fantasy elements wh a classic school sty  one tightly plotted package On the whole Goblet of Fire is excellent but  does have a tendency to meer as we move away from that simple templateI found all the nonsense about the Quiddch Wld Cup (a reference to the 1998 Football Wld Cup  France perhaps?) un-necessary after a while f example which could have been cut out  at least shtened -  we would still have been left wh a fe piece of wk whout disruptg the flow of the sty  my opionOn the other h one must admire the auth f tryg to brg me depth to her characters  flesh out their personas which draws the reader to Harry`s wld makg  seem believableOverall I thk this is a truly `magical` sty
The Harry Potter books are not only wonderful f children but great f adults  I know many christian ganizations are banng this book but I beg to dfer  I'm christian  they are wrten wh the same tensy as the Narnia Chronicles wrten by CS Lewis  He was also a christian  As long as children are readg 700 page books  not playg video games  watchg TV I'm all f   Can't wa f the next book  The wld is full of danger  we should let our kids read books that will help them deal wh those fears  feelgs  Great book series  read the Chronicles of Narnia  you like Harry Potter
Not to say that I'm not a muggle but I just thk that who ever has the nerve to come  here  just dish on Harry Potter gots to go get that book  read  befe they pass judgement  In my 21 years of le  I have never found a book so out there that makes me feel &quotGosh I wish I was at Hogwarts too  that Harry is soooooooooooooooooo cool&quot  I had read all the 4 books  one month because I can't stop wonderg what gog to happen next  I use to wonder why on earh is everyone over Harry Potter  now I know why  Harry Potter  The Fire of Goblet is wonderful I felt that I was there  every time Potter thks that he is beg watch I kept thkg He knows that I'm lookg at him  This book as all the unimagable plot that makes you what on earh is gog on But  makes you heart beat faster  faster because you want to know who's dog what  I feel  love wh Potter the first time i got these books f my siblg  They sist that I buy I f them  I really didn't bother at first but after havg nothg to do  wag to go back to school I picked  upd was amazed at  f the display  had  names  provides  I don't underst how people who are so called christans  God believers felt that a book like Harry Potter can do anythg to their children  What rubbish   makes me just want to send them  the book  see how scared they be  they encounter a big giant ghost wches warlocks  the famous villians  the book  They got to understnad that  Harry Potter can only brighten their day as well as their lives  Right now all i'm wahg f is the 5th book that is out next year  Which i thk is a bummer I was hopg  comes out today  somethg  AAAAAhhhh Muggles we can never really underst that we just have to s back  wa  ahhh yeah If i'm 21  fd this book to be the moster fabulous book on  earth imag children when they read this:)
Harry Potter  the goblet of fire is the best one yet  If you have read any of the previous books you know that they are hard to beat  I am 19 years old  I thought that a book geared f younger readers couldn't be terestg but I read   was amazed  There is a great sty le   is very easy readg  All  all I give  as many stars as they will let me give
Christian parents beware! This is not a book you want your kids to read!  It's amazg to me that Christians have been swept away by the media hype over Harry Potter  have completely overlooked the totally anti-Bible  anti-Christian perspective that the Goblet of Fire was wrten from I know that wizards wches the magical arts astrology necromancy are all said to be the stuff of legends  children's fantasy The ignant  uniated say &quotNo harm done!&quot But I beg to dfer! If you are a Christian parent  you are considerg buyg this book f your children I strongly urge you to read what the Bible says about the magical arts astrology necromancy  the like befe you let your children read this It may seriously affect their spirual health!
the fourth chapter  the harry potter series is amazg  is really good because of these followg event's The Quiddch wld cup  the twizard tournament but all these events ends up  a most unfourtanate way the fourth book shows the darker side of the Harry Potter series readers who had read this book know what I am sayg Other than that  is a adventure filled sty i hope you all enjoy &quotHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire&quot
Tremendous sty  Terric endg: closure mixed wh logical progression to her next book  Rowlg's challenge will be to accomplish the same thg  book 5 now that she's made known that there will be a 6th book  She doesn't pull her punches  has done a great job wh creatg rounded characters warts  all She could've trimmed some of the middle parts whout takg away from the plot (though the entire sty was unmly entertag) especially f the younger readers  On the other h I'm  sure that many readers (myself cluded) enjoy 700+ pages of Harry Potter
&quotGoblet of Fire&quot lives up to all the hype of the media  expectations readers have after readg the first three books It is still very well wrten  very excg This episode of the Harry Potter saga is much longer than the previous tales (743 pages) so we get experience a much me detailed idea of what  is like to live as a wizard  a wch Harry even spends the first several chapters at the Quiddch Wld Cup wh the Weasleys so not all of the book ( the plot) revolves around le at HogwartsThe characters are growg up  as such are gettg much me mature While the development of the characters leads us to the typical realm of adolescence (ie: boys &amp girls dances etc)  also marks a pot where we realize our fictional friends are stronger so expect a me powerful battle between the fces of good  the fces of evil Expect &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot to be much darker then your previous journeys to Harry's wld Don't expect to fd only magic flaved jellybeans  practical jokes also expect fear mutilation  death &quotGoblet of Fire&quot has a much me realistic  heart felt endg than what you will be expectg just keep  md that this is all pivotal to the overall plot of the seven book seriesIn case I have you completely down about the dark side of the new book I might as well mention that we do get to see Sirius  the loveable ltle Dobby as well as some of Dobby's new elf friends
I LOVE all of the Harry Potter books  can't wa f another one! This was maybe the best book yet  when i got to the end i wanted MORE If you havn't read the Harry Potter books yet you need to! I can't wa f the next one but untill then i guess ill just have to keep readg 1-4 over  over aga!
This book is one of Rowlg's best The lenght of  makes  much me wth the money The charecters develop much me then  the previous books  she (the auth) disscusses issues like slavery  other thgs However  is still too much of a good  evil thg Volemt is all bad  Harry all good This made the book a ltle wse b/c a truly good auth would make the vill be st of good  the hero have a touch of bad None the less this book is defy wth the money f anyone I strongly suggest that you buy this book b/c you will be the better f   you read 
As an adult who grew up on JRR Tolke  other Sci-Fi  fantasy greats I am thrilled that the Harry Potter series has become so popular My 11 year son was just as eagerly f the next release as I do  even though the books have gotten amazgly lengthy we both rip through them as quickly as we can When Goblet of Fire came out he read through the entire book  2 days hed  over to me  I stayed up until 5am so I could fish  as well Sce then we have lent  out to numerous friends  relatives who were equally  love wh It has all the classic elements - good agast evil bullies unfair suations misunderstgs the magic that can help you w even when all seems lost If nothg else  is encouragg millions of youngsters to read  an age that tv  computers are replacg books I applaud JK Rowlg  wish her all the success  the wld
Should Quaker kids be readg Harry Potter sties?  As you no doubt know Harry is a wizard  a wld of dragons warlocks magic spells  battles  Reasons why Quaker kids should read Harry Potter:* The Harry Potter books are wonderful f gettg kids terested  READING* Most Quaker adults are Muggles  the books teach kids how to deal wh Muggles* There are too few books out that terest boys  readg - the Potter books get boys AND girls terested  readg* There are too few books out that parents enjoy readg wh their kids* Harry probably has Quaker routes - he's terested  social causes the rights of the underdog  general fairness to all  He even leans toward non-violent solutions to most problems This book especially touches on the social causes as Hermione fights f the rights of the House ElvesI have to confess I found the begng of this book simultaneously bg (too much Quiddch)  questionable as there was some brutaly  I was also saddened toward the end of this book at a death that could have been better hledBut  the big picture the spts theme is of terest to boys (girls too) we can read  talk together  my son's readg terest has gone up 100% sce gog through all 4 of these booksThe only downsize here is that we don't know what to read until  the fth book comes out!
This book unlike the previous 3 is slow  taxg  Rowlg gets caught up  the details  there isn't enough terestg aspects to the sty to susta all the wds a st of Stephen Kg disease  Her lerary style becomes too apparent  a dra  This book desperately needs an edg pass  a return to the wtess  drama of her previous books  I read the previous Harry Potters to my 7 year old (now 8)  he'd beg f another chapter  I would read ahead after he fell asleep  This book puts him to sleep after a couple of pages  I am happy just to put  down to the night  Cannot recommend this one at allJust to qualy this we are only through about 1/3 of the book  Maybe  gets better but I doubt we'll fd out
The Harry Potter Series is an excellently wrten set of books  Theyare very imagative  are an amazg sty from problem toresolution  This is the first set of books that have an endg thatis actually many times me excg than you would thk  Also theyare completely unpredictableNow there are some parents whoabsolutely fbid there children to read them  Some say that theyattempt to promote wchcraft  Satanism  These books are filled tothe cover of magic  magical teachgs  Harry  his friends learnabout the histy of the magical wld the art of potion-makg thetransfiguration (changg one thg to another)  apparion(disappearg from one place  reappearg  another) processesthe magically botanical studies of Herbology the care of magicalcreatures Charms (spells that allow you to move objects protectyourself as well as change the physical appearance of thgs)Divation (aka predictg the future Harry  his friends do not anyway excel  this subject  believe that very few wizardscarry this talent) Astronomy  last  most imptant DefenseAgast the Dark ArtsIt is fun  excg to read about all ofhis classes but let's thk f a mute about one  particularDefense Agast the Dark Arts  People go on  on about the evilDark Ld  the books  about the dark spells  curses that arefeared by Harry  his friends  teachers  But  Harry takes aspecic class to learn how to defend himself agast these eviltopics how can anyone say that these books promote evil wchcraft wizardry  All of the magical people  the books are fearful ofthe Dark Side  are fightg agast  Agast ?  HmmDoesthat really sound as though these books were wrten to promote theDark Side?  Absolutely not!These books were wrten  aretended to be read f the entertament of the reader by enjoygHarry's many adventures at his magical school  How can learng abouthisty of magic potion-makg transfiguration divation charmsastronomy the carg f/of magical plants  animals  DefenseAgast the Dark Arts (there's that wd aga) be sac-religioussatanic  even promotional to violence  sler  If you ask memost of these parents haven't even read these books to know enoughabout them  even  they have they probably have so much freetime that all they care about is havg somethg gripe  complaabout to consume timeAlso I underst that some parents arespeakg out agast the Harry Potter Series because of what they haveheard about   are tryg to protect their children from aChristian pot of view  Well as a le-long Christian that grew uparound the church I would just like to say that I have no objectionsabout readg the Harry Potter Series  As I have said befe thecharacters  these books battle agast the evil Dark Side  Nowthere are those students who believe  the magic  these booksThose students are the types that me than likely have no Christianbackground  I have also heard that there are some kids who wereChristians but now say that magic is the only way  that the Bibleis nothg but a terribly ruly book of sties  rules  Thesestudents have already got problems  they actually believe  thismagic  JK Rowlg states  an terview that she has wrten herbooks f the enjoyment of the reader  Rowlg herself does notbelieve  any of this  She simply wrote some sties f her own even what she thought would be the few people that would read them'sentertament  Never did she guess that her wrgs would bepublished much less become bestsellersIn this InterviewRowlg also states that her fave auth is C S LewisCS Lewis is a bn-aga Christian wh many biblical teachgsYet he wrote the Chronicles of Narnia  I don't know how many timesI've read articles explag how dferent the Harry Potter Series isfrom the Chronicles but still how can an evil wch wh deep darkmagic be so much dferent than the evil Dark Ld  the Harry PotterSeries  My own church family heard our preacher Rev Jeff Wcher32 preach quote after quote from C S Lewis's teachgs  Lewiswres about the fight agast the evil deep dark magical wch Narnia  Rowlg wres about Harry's fight agast the Dark Ld the wizard wld yet CS Lewis is still looked up to f hisbiblical teachgs so why is there so much fuss about Harry Potter?Both series are  the school libraries around the wld  are evenused as English readg tools durg class  both have lerature teachg materials used f teachg other fms of language artsBoth series' have a mal f each chapter  Both series' contabooks that have won awards such as the Parentg Book of the YearAward  So I ask aga what is wrong wh Harry Potter?So fthose students that are turng away from Christiany  areconvertg to these beliefs try to underst that JK Rowlg didnot wre these books to try to encourage Christians to believe magic  No human can magically do anythg so why would anyone believe magic to be real  The purpose  these books were to enterta thereaderA wrer from Beliefnet ([]) says this:&quotThere are some Christians who view these two activies as acontradiction--who thk that Hogwarts is wse than hogwash  thatthe magical scenarios of JK Rowlg's imagation are herentlyun-Christian I would counter that stead these books have thepotential to be profoundly Christian  readers can see past themedium (magic) to the novels' deeper messages about self-sacricethe triumph of good over evil  the glious possibily of humanredemption&quotJust two weeks ago at my school the specialeducation teacher was tellg the school secretary while I was wkg the front office as an eighth grade office-aid that one of herstudents that she had been havg problems wh tryg to keep himcalm quiet  attentive had found the first book  the series was silently tryg to terpret the wds on his own  She thoughtthat  this book appeared to be that terestg to him maybe sheshould read  to him  use his terest  this particular book asa tool to assist her  teachg him how to read  learn better easier  So  even students that are  some way disabled can readunderst  enjoy these books why can't everybody try  at leasthave the chance to read enjoy  underst them  F as I havestated befe those that come to believe that magic is real  aretaken to the Dark Side because of these books are  lessunderstg befe they have read them than after because everyoneshould know that none of these thgs that we read  enjoy readgabout are trueNow let's focus on another of Harry's subjectsDivation  Many believe that the act of tryg to predict the future the Harry Potter Series should not even be wrten  But onceaga Harry does not  any way excel  this subject  believes asHermione said 'that  is a very imprecise branch of magic'  In factdurg Harry's third year at Howarts Hermione disagreed wh theirDivation teacher Profess Trelawney  qu takg theclassNow that is sayg somethg because Hermione is the most clever ofthe three ma characters Harry Ron Weasley  herself  She alsostated at the begng of the year that ' foolish guesswk pretendg to see death omens is what  takes to become a truesee-er then I'm not sure I will be takg this class much longerJust because Rowlg wres about Divation doesn't mean that shebelieves   n is she tryg to encourage her young readers totake on this foolish practice  So  Harry  his friends believethat Profess Trelawney is as they say contuosly an &quotoldfraud&quot Hermione qu takg the class  Ron is alwaysperfmg stupid imations of her then how can anyone say thatRowlg is tryg to promote this strange practice  like I saidbefe anyone who actually believes  this practice  any otherfm of magic is already as Ron believes the headmaster ProfessDumblede is 'off his rocker'WoW!  Can you believe !  Thatbrgs up another topic Profess Dumblede  I've heard othercomplats about some of Dumblede's wise saygs  One f exampleis when  the third book after Harry tells Dumblede that hethought he saw his father but  was really him Dumblede answersby sayg that although he may not have actually seen his father hemay have simply found him side himself  Many argue  reply to thiswise sayg that your parent's  any other ancest's spirs do notrema side you after they are deceased  I agree on this thoughtNo the dead's spirs do not rema side us (only Jesus's doesthat whenever we ask him to) but the memies that we have of themhowever do's imagation are herentlyun-Christian I would counter that stead these books have thepotential to be profoundly Christian  readers can see past themedium (magic) to the novels' deeper messages about self-sacricethe triumph of good over evil  the glious possibily of humanredemption&quotJust two weeks ago at my school the specialeducation teacher was tellg the school secretary while I was wkg the front office as an eighth grade office-aid that one of herstudents that she had been havg problems wh tryg to keep himcalm quiet  attentive had found the first book  the series was silently tryg to terpret the wds on his own  She thoughtthat  this book appeared to be that terestg to him maybe sheshould read  to him  use his terest  this particular book asa tool to assist her  teachg him how to read  learn better easier  So  even students that are  some way disabled can readunderst  enjoy these books why can't everybody try  at leasthave the chance to read enjoy  underst them  F as I havestated befe those that come to believe that magic is real  aretaken to the Dark Side because of these books are  lessunderstg befe they have read them than after because everyoneshould know that none of these thgs that we read  enjoy readgabout are trueNow let's focus on another of Harry's subjectsDivation  Many believe that the act of tryg to predict the future the Harry Potter Series should not even be wrten  But onceaga Harry does not  any way excel  this subject  believes asHermione said 'that  is a very imprecise branch of magic'  In factdurg Harry's third year at Howarts Hermione disagreed wh theirDivation teacher Profess Trelawney  qu takg theclassNow that is sayg somethg because Hermione is the most clever ofthe three ma characters Harry Ron Weasley  herself  She alsostated at the begng of the year that ' foolish guesswk pretendg to see death omens is what  takes to become a truesee-er then I'm not sure I will be takg this class much longerJust because Rowlg wres about Divation doesn't mean that shebelieves   n is she tryg to encourage her young readers totake on this foolish practice  So  Harry  his friends believethat Profess Trelawney is as they say contuosly an &quotoldfraud&quot Hermione qu takg the class  Ron is alwaysperfmg stupid imations of her then how can anyone say thatRowlg is tryg to promote this strange practice  like I saidbefe anyone who actually believes  this practice  any otherfm of magic is already as Ron believes the headmaster ProfessDumblede is 'off his rocker'WoW!

I cannot state  this space what hasn't already been said about the absolute brilliance  genre of JK Rowlgs novel/novels I'm completely sure whout a doubt that 100 years from now these books will fd their home on an old carved mahogany bookshelf next to the likes of AAMilne Beatrix Potter Frank Baum Grimm Brothers Mark Twa Edgar Allen Poe the Bronte Sisters Madelee L'Engle John Stebeck HG Wells Gege Orwell Shakespeare (que possibly!)etcAs readers we are truly lucky to have been a part of this lerary whirlwd  excement  will remember well f generations to come these masterpieces we lovgly call &quotThe Harry Potter Books&quot

The Harry Pter books are the best I've read  a while (And I'm que stgy wh my 5 stars!)  Each book  the series is better than the one befe Can defely be enjoyed by both children AND adults  Rowlg is a brilliant  imagative sty teller
This book is wonderful  I absolutely aded   I have read all of the Harry Potter books at least twice   they are all marvelous  While this one is not the best of them  my opion  is most DEFINITELY nearly tied wh the Prisoner of Azkaban which is my personal fave  Rowlg is an astonishgly clever auth  I hope she reads this because I want her to know exactly how beautul her books are  The Goblet of Fire is a wonderful book full of mystery  suspense comedy  sentimentaly unexpected twists yet leavg readers screamg &quotI KNEW IT!  I KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN! &quot  This is a must read f ANYONE  Some people thk this series is meant f children  that may well be but they are creasgly tense  the way of what one would allow a child to read  Each book tops the last  me ways than one  (although the Prisoner of Azkaban is STILL my fave one thus far) this one is no exception
This book was a deep  enchantg read from the fristn page to the last  Wh the 2 days  took me to read  had trapped my  the deep  me somber atmosphere  Rowlg stated this would be me dark  mysterious   was  Like a greta series  makes you want me  keeps you hungry f the next book  This is the best book  the sty by far!
It's certaly the fullest - double the size of the previous offergs I haven't come across anyone who doesn't enjoy these books She follows the Joe-Bob Briggs rule of sequels which is that the closer a sequel is to the igal the better  will be The fmula is still the same but the mix gets richer  richer wh time Plus there is now a real sty developg through the books as well as Harry's development It really is staggerg how given that there are so many books one book can st out so far - Ms Rowlg really has a magic gt
I know everyone on earth has reviewed this book but I just have to say I love !  I can't wa to have kids to read  to over  over aga!  Hary Potter just sucks you   leaves you wh a warm feelg  a need f me Harry Potter!  I just can't wa f me books!
This is the best Harry Potter book I've ever read!  I thk you should step right side the bookste  BUY IT!  Read some pages  I bet you would be HOOKED!   I bet you would buy all the series  be a fan!  I thk everybody will enjoy this exellent  fantastic book!  I can't wa f the next book!  ooh so good!  BUY IT!
I loved the book! I'm gog to read  f the second time now!  you loved the first three books you'll love this one even me! I can't wa f the 5th one to come out! Read this book  you like alot of adventure  excg turns  twists!
This book is a very good book  I'd say this is the best Harry Potter book so far  He has a lot of close calls because Hogwarts is havg somethg that they haven't done  about 150 years  He has do do 3 tasks f a huge trophy  The Quidch Wld Cup is great  If you haven't read any Harry Potter books you should start readg them  They're really good
I am 28 years old  I am a big fan of Harry Potter One thg I fd tesestg about Harry Potter is how often he  is physically wounded  these books  And yet he is so courageous!  Of course this is a fantasy novel most 14 year olds would be runng to their mommies  I'm glad that Harry Potter can be a hero to the younger readers  I thk the message at the end of the book is clear- Meet your problems head on!  I really like that  I like how the books are gettg me matureDumblede has also been one of my fave characters-I really enjoyed the sight to his le  These books are always suprisg  very imagative  I must say that I am glad we have to wa f the next one  It will give the kids a good chance to read somethg else  Judgg by the endg of the fourth book the next book will be very excg!  What will the wizardg wld do now that Voldemt has his body back?  The good will prevail!
Harry Potter is 14 a dficult time f any teen as their mds bodies  wld go through tremendous changes  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire brgs out all of the issues of adolescence  a charmg  humous manner  JK Rowlg's settg is also changg  The nocence of childhood is encroached by fear  anxiety  The Hogwart wld darkens as evil makes a comeback  All of these evolutions are superbly chestrated by the auth  a manner that is satisfyg  screamg f Book V  Harry is growg  this series is growg as a classic
The Harry Potter sties have taken the wld by stm  There are four of them now  Wrten f pre-  early teen readers Harry's adventures still have appeal f older readers wh the same magic the classic children's tales such as Wd  the Willows Peter Pan  the Pooh sties  Harry was troduced  &quotScerer's Stone&quot along wh his cohts Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger  the rest of the faculty staff  students of the Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizzardry  Harry is an phan livg wh his aunt uncle  cous  an environment that makes Cderella's look good  Harry's mother   father were both magicians  A bad magician Voldemt one on the &quotdark side&quot killed Harry's parents  Sent to live wh his aunt  uncle ( brat of a cous) Harry doesn't know about the magic wld  However Harry is a hero  the magic wld  when he reaches eleven he is admted to the Hogwarts School  Thus beg the adventures  Each of the four books thus far covers one school year  The plan must be f at least seven books because Hogwarts has a seven year curriculum  Each year so far Harry  his friends have foiled an evil scheme to brg back the bad magician Each year the schemes have become me complex  the sty told better  The books have also gotten longer  After the fourth book  spe of Harry's heroism the evil one Voldemt has returned  is ready to beg aga to conquer first the magic wld  then the mundane &quotMuggle&quot wld  There have been some complats about the books because they have wches  magic  But as a character  another sty said &quotMagic alchemy science-what's the dference?&quot  There are fces fightg f good agast fces fightg f evil  Isn't that what Milton  Dante  even Jeremiah wrote about?  In the Harry Potter sties there is no confusion about who are the good guys  who are the bad guys  So the good guys play hockey ridg on broomsticks so what?  It is fun   is entertag  I am certaly lookg fward to Harry's next adventureod guys play hockey ridg on broomsticks so what?  It is fun   is entertag  I am certaly lookg fward to Harry's next adventure
The second I closed book three  this series I opened this one As the freshness had wn of just a ltle b  part three (see my review there) I wondered what counter-measures Mrs Rowlg would use to cope wh this Well she must have noticed the same thg  this book is a ltle departure from the other three novels First  is nearly twice as long as the last one (well great the me Harry the better)  some of the now familiar plot elements of the first three have to take a back-seat  this novel like the Quiddch school-match (f which you get a wld-cup!)  mostly the dary school le  lessons The unsual length of this book makes  a b slow until Harry gets to Hogwarts aga (don't wry after that the book picks up s usual Rowlg-breakneck-pace) but  allows the auth to clude some nice plot-side-les ( you ever wanted to know somethg about &quotmagic-tabloid-journalism&quot  a house-elf liberation front try this one!) which are not exactly necessary f the ma plot but add greatly to the canvas of this novel  the enjoyment of the reader What I mostly enjoyed about this book was that the endless imagation of Mrs Rowlg has not dried up  she was still able to come up wh a surprisg amount of new ideas new facets  each of the characters a suspenseful  que complex plot  f the fourth time wh a slam-bang fale Now a note to concerned parents: If you have read that  this book Harry starts noticg girls  that  is darker than the last ones don't wry you can still let your children read : Yes Harry starts noticg girls but only from a distance nothg me (I wonder  which book Mrs Rowlg will come up wh a girl-friend f Harry  you have read this book you know that there are two contenders)  this book is defely darker than the other books but shoulnd't be too frighteng f smaller children If they're used to fairy-tales  over 10 years old they will be able to cope wh this trust me on that The only complat I have is that the auth put so many loose ends  this book that her struggle to tie them all  the end is too clearly visible the last pages are crammed wh solvg mysteries  explag thgs The construction of the first three novels was a ltle b me elegant But let this not hder you this is still a very satisfyg entertag  spirg novel  simply a great read which is still very well wth another five stars Now I have like so many people out there suffer the terrible deal to wa a long time f the fth book  you bet I will be stg  le when the bookstes open around midnight on some fe day  the future to sell the fth part  this extradary  outstg series to usd they will be able to cope wh this trust me on that The only complat I have is that the auth put so many loose ends  this book that her struggle to tie them all  the end is too clearly visible the last pages are crammed wh solvg mysteries  explag thgs The construction of the first three novels was a ltle b me elegant But let this not hder you this is still a very satisfyg entertag  spirg novel  simply a great read which is still very well wth another five stars Now I have like so many people out there suffer the terrible deal to wa a long time f the fth book  you bet I will be stg  le when the bookstes open around midnight on some fe day  the future to sell the fth part  this extradary  outstg series to us
I didn't read this book I devoured ! I'm 21  Harry Potter's spell caught on me as  I was 12 The books just keep gettg better  better this huge book is read  a couple of days JK Rowlg know how to build her sty so well the end can't be guessed just don't let your children rush to the end just to see how  fishes! Laughter is a constant presence wh the Weasley tws  Ron suspense is often unbearable  you can also cry sometimes Harry Potter's growg up wth watchg! gettg better  better F kids a must-have f grown-ups a burst of fresh air of fantasy

I thought &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot was good but this one is even better! All elements are here: heartbreak jealousy happess romance death suspicionwhat lies next f Harry Potter?Who is the mysterious loyal follower of Voldemt at Hogwarts? Is  Profess McGonagall?This was an excellent book I was on vacation  could barely take my nose out of   Very good just the right amount of magical le  wizardry f a good summer read to somethg basic such as good vs evil If only adult sci/fi fantasy were as simple! Three cheers f JK Rowlg lets get that 5th book out please!
It has been five years   you still haven't read any of the Harry Potter books then congratulations you are crazy!  Read them!  Buy them!  They're wth way me than they are sold f! Everyone from ages 8 to 100 will defely enjoy this book  I GUARRANTEE!  And f all you people who thk 's evil well that's probably because of the wd 'wch' that appears  the books  You are used to that meang an evil woman who curses people  The book are not about that -  the books a wch is simply the female wd f wizard  I can tell you f sure that there are lerally millions of people who thought they were gog to be just another bg book wh long confusg sentences  stupid strange made up wds like  The Ld of The Rgs although that is a very good trilogy  fally tried   couldn't put the book down even  they were embarassed that they were wrong  You will be glad you bought them  you will share them wh your family  friends  good times will be had by all!
The other 3 Best Books were the first three  this seriesJK Rowlg must be one of the best Auth's that I have had the great pleasure of readg  As a 36 year old American Male wh an MBA I would guess that I am not the typical reader  However I have recommended this series of books to several friends f BOTH their children  themselves  I igally purchased this series on the recommendation of a friend of a similar background who was readg the sties to his 8+ year-old son  I must adm that I was skeptical at first but  didn't take but a few pages befe I was completely HOOKED!  I couldn't seem to read fast enough  I have gotten both of my sons (12 &amp 15) to read  enjoy the books as well  My ONLY disappotment is that I have fished them BEFORE Book 5 has been released  I am a DEFINITE fan  I tend to own ALL of the Harry Potter Books  the series  I only wish that JK Rowlg would consider contug the series beyond the Hogwarts' years  I can personally image much opptuny f the style to contue  I will have even WORSE whdrawals once I know that  is over!  BUY ALL THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES  I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE diappoted
This Harry Potter book is 734 pages long therefe allowg a lot of dramatic twists  the plot that completely punch you  the face  leave you thkg &quotWhoa where'd that come from?&quot But JK Rowlg explas everythg  her spell-bdg plots  ultimately you come out wh a very well-wrten excg  suspenseful novel Indeed  is suspenseful largely because of the book's conclusion  a special event that takes place at Hogwarts durg Harry's fourth year A lot of new ideas are entertaed  this book f example JK Rowlg has never let any romance develop among her characters but there is certaly some of that  this book All Harryheads out there must expect this book to be just as good as the others so I won't talk about the plot much anyme I'd like to comment though on the reviews that state Harry Potter as beg un-Christian  violatg Christian beliefs I have heard a lot of thgs concerng this issue one particularly farfetched one sayg that Harry Potter books have been banned by the pope  that one could do magic after readg all books Obviously these are very ludicrous statements only made by people who have no sense of hum adventure darg  imagation I mean come on! I live  the Philippes  I doubt very much that there'd be a Diagon Alley hidden somewhere  Manila  a Hogwarts castle hidg  the secluded nthern isls of my country Some people just need to get  through their heads that these books are f FUN we read them to have a b of a laugh  we learn some pretty good values as well So just let us read our Harry Potter books  peace will ya!
Yeah! It really wth the wag at the library near my home here  NMiami Fl I'm a mother of three ltle angels  let me tell you this is the most hear me the MOST fascatg book that I had ever read to my babies sce they were bn I noticed how exced they get when I say ''s Harry Potter book nigth'  is amazg how quiet they are when i'm readg f them  how anxious they are to go to bed so they could hear a new amazg sty from the ltle boy wh powers  We Love all of your books Thank you f brgg them to my le A+ from all of us  Marlene &amp kids
I thk the Harry Potter books are great  They shouldn't make kids believe  Satan  They just show that JK Rowlg has a great imagation  I thk that they show the love of a mother  the strength  courage of a young boy  It shows how the good conquer the evil  that nobody enjoys the company of a bad person unless they are bad themselves  Everyone should read these books  I've read each of them each twice
I have read all four books now  wh each one I fd a new delightful turn of the imagation  My daughter started readg the books first  pleaded wh me to read too  I'm very glad that she did  I cannot fathom how anyone would make the statement that these books are &quotunchristian&quot  seriously make any other similar comment  Obviously they eher have a very closed ( bg) md  they simply didn't read the books  Harry's humily courage concern f fellow man loyalty  talent that the auth exceptionally ptrays are so very &quotchristianly&quot admirable  I just can't wa f the next book to follow the amazg feats  turn of events  Harry's fth year!
This book is one of Rowlg's best The lenght of  makes  much me wth the money The charecters develop much me then  the previous books  she (the auth) disscusses issues like slavery  other thgs However  is still too much of a good  evil thg Volemt is all bad  Harry all good This made the book a ltle wse b/c a truly good auth would make the vill be st of good  the hero have a touch of bad None the less this book is defy wth the money f anyone I strongly suggest that you buy this book b/c you will be the better f   you read 
This is the best book I have ever read even though I am only  the 13 years old It was so terestg  I couldn't put  down It took me only 2 days to read I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever read any of the Harry Potter books It is a grippg edge of your seat thriller ) Even better than some movies This book is 5 stars out of 5 stars no contest It is f sure the best book ever
I'm absolutely ravg about this book!  (not to mention the 3 others)  Though the plot is darker gloomier  me sister JK Rowlg did not  disappot me f I was able to fish the book  2 days! There were new  characters troduced such as Ra Skeeter Mad-Eye Moody Barty   Crouch the leprechauns the veelas  lots me (too many to mention)  I  would have wanted me action wh the Dursleys though This book is  defely me excg what wh the Triwizard Tournament wh Harry's  first task was to face the fiercest dragon Hurry up JK Rowlg  h  over the rest of the series!  Harry is the BEST!
Harry Potter is a boy whose parents were killed by the wlds most powerful wizard Voldemt In the 4th book Harry goes back to Hogwarts a  wizardg school  his fourth year I like Harry Potter because  basicly  deals wh what most public schoolers deal wh bullies brats  know--alls wst enemies  best friends In Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire there is a special event f wizards that hasn't happened  f 100 years The Triwizard Tournament Harry's name is  &quotacidently&quot put to the Goblet of Fire If you want to learn  what happened next you'll need to read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I thk this is a book f anybody even though  says f kids 9-12
This is the best book i have ever read  I used to not read  my mom bought  f me f christmas i read the first three  a week  When The  4th one came out i read   2 days  I cant fd any other book like   I have read the series over  over  Almost anyone would like this book  I hope JK Rawlg keeps wrg because im gog to go nuts whout the  books
I really loved the first three Harry Potter books but they compare nothg to the fourth one which is  my opion by far the best JK  Rowlg will be comg out wh three me Harry Potter books befe the  series ends I am lookg fward to them I recommend this book to anyone  of any age wh an imagation
I am a 30-somethg year old man  I am not ashamed to I am a Potter junkie! A few months ago I thought the Potter frenzy was just the silliest  thg  that the followers (over 16) were just GITs! Well now I am a GIT!  I came to Potter-mania as a tut f my nephew's readg circle They  read Azkaban (#3)  I went along Three days after fishg I was buyg  the other three books  I just now put down The Goblet of Fire by far he  best of the four (They only get better!) Rowlg has allowed the reader to  grow  change wh Potter The style has kept me fixed Not eatg   drkg  socializg wh my aged peers I feel like a kid aga The  series has exced me beyond anythg I have experienced sce Anne Rice   honestly Rowlg may replace Rice on my top shelf Anyway Goblet is  tense  moves like the giant snakes Harry has encountered Rowlg's  wds wrap around you  hold you fixated until the very end The problem  now that I fished Goblet of Fire iswhat will I do until the next  release I can't st ! And when  is released I will be the first GIT   le f all the TV news cameras to see Orwell wrote  about Big  Brother  I will say  about HarryI love Harry Potter  (BTW the  only thg I will give away is that GIT is a wd I picked up from Ron If  you don't underst who Ron is then read the series!)
Aga a masterpiece of wrg!  I love all the Harry Potter books although the second still has to be my favoure the twists the turns the  excementdrama sadness hatred etc etc Soooo many emotions  one  &quotchildrens&quot book s amazg!  I'm 16  i can still be as  enthusiastic about these books as my 11 year old brother!  You won't  regret readg any of these books   you do you are very strange  deed!
Why the heck are they complag!  They're lerature-deficient kids are fally beg troduced to books  all they can do is compla No  this book is not satanical I'm a Christian not a ddvil-wphipper md  you Why? Because does  have any type of reference to the devil? Well  Ld Voldemt is really evil but they're completely unrelated So what is  they do magic? Are they afraid that they're kids will start practisg  magic? Guess what? It doesn't wk haha! Magic real magic does not exist   the hs of people There are supernatural occurgs but that's  dferent It's not caused by a person by their will The people who are  afraid that this book will encouage anti-Christianism are over-senstive  people like Ned FlersThis book is great better than all the  others But one thg I'm startg to get disturbed on is the lack of  relevance of Ron Weasley Harry is the famous wizard who escaped (not  defeated) Ld Voldemt twice  Hermione Granger is the whiz that aces  every test But what about po Ron? He wanted to come to Hogwarts tryg  to become greats like all his brothers but 4 years has passed  all  he's done is &quotassist&quot Harry on his many quests I would really  like to see Ms Rowlg give Ron some cred other than beg Harry's  sidekickI won't the sty too much away but the Goblet of Fire is  like a judge You put your names     decides the most wthy  champion to participate  the Tri-Wizard Tournament from the 3 magic  schools of Beauxbatons Durmstrang  of course good ol' Hogwarts Even  though Harry couldn't put his name   because he's underage his name  is somehow entered  he's chosen Did some dark wizard put   so  Harry would die  the dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament?

The first thg I noticed when I first picked up this book was the sheer mass  Each book  this stallment is gag girth at this rate book 7  should exceed 1000 pages  I wried that Rowlg might be afflicted wh  successful wrer disease (greater edial control leadg to redundant  unreadable tomes eg Tom Clancy)  My fears proved false  Each page told  an excg deep sty that kept me riveted throughout  And aga I  offer adulation to any wrer that can keep children turng hundreds of  pagesMy only concern upon completg my readg was that Goblet of  Fire might be a b too dark f the youngest readers  This is the  &quotEmpire Strikes Back&quot stallment of the series where our heroes  are put through their greatest losses  most dire perils  Also much  like the 2nd stallment of Star Wars the conclusion is anythg but  aludg to greater conflict to come  As befe I encourage parents to  read wh their children  Not only is this somethg you can share wh  them s defely an activy of greater benef than md-numbg  television sessions  Fally any adult who remembers beg a child will  enjoy what is turng out to be a seriously good wk of stytellg  Rowlg is not underrated ask your children
If you haven't read this book yet you are  f a treat! Come to the magical wld of wchcraft  wizardry  you'll be left wantg me Maybe sendg  letter wh you owl to Harry? Why did this book get  banned?  A really potless thg to do If you thk this book goes  agast Christian beliefs you better check your prospectives Just because  the people  these books practice magic doesn't mean maybe the auth is  thkg that they are  are not Christian This book teaches strong  bonds like how  even  a competion stayg true to your beliefs   friends is a very good thg to do This book was wonderful a very  compellg read After I fished  I was left sayg &quotIs that  ?&quot I certaly hope JK Rowlg wres me after Harry gets out  of Hogwarts about his careerWas anybody else dissapoted that there  were no quiddch matches this year?
I believe this Harry Potter book is the best yet even though  has looks a b gloomy f the future  It has the most wonderful  thought-out  mystery  I suggest  to any one who likes mysteries  magic!  I  can't wa f the next one
When the frenzy over this book started I knew I was missg somethg so I bought  read all three befe startg on this one  I devoured them  This book was terric  If you like readg (yes  general) then you  should give this book a try  I didn't thk I would enjoy  but I  didThe only sad part is that there are still 14 me months until HP5  comes out!
Harry Ron Hermione  all of the others have totally won me over! I own all four books although I loaned the first 3 to my aunt  am  currently tryg my hardest to get them back so I may reread them!  Durg  the countless hours I spent over the Lab Day weekend readg the 4th  book (thanks Grpa! ) I found myself wishg f the millionth time  that I was a wch at Hogwarts flyg high over the Quiddch field  shoppg  Diagon Alley  drkg a butterbeer  Hogsmeade I tried to  slow my readg--I wanted the book to go on  onTo the po po  people who beleve that this book is  any way shape  fm  un-Christian (aHEM! They celebrate Christmas like I've only dreamed  about!) evil  satanic all I can say is  I'm sry that you are missg  out on some  of the best books to ever h the shelf Do they REALLY expect  us to go out  curse them just because of the books?  PleaseI can't  WAIT f the movie! And I am beggg JK Rowlgs not to keep me   suspense any longer than she has to on the wrg of the 5th book  Oh  how I wish I wasn't stuck beg a Muggle
The Harry Potter books get better every time! I'm a Christian  a Harry Potter fan  I see no problem wh any of the books' content (Though I  wouldn't read them to a young kid)  Sometimes I thk JK Rowlg is a  wch herself  put an enchantment over the books I'm addicted! I agree  wh the person who said that 'just because we read these books doesn't  mean we're gog to go out  hex our friends' I mean come on! The 4th  book was a ltle darker than the other 3 though what wh You-Know-Who   everythg The last few chapters had me shak'  my boots! All I  have to say is &quotGood job Ms Rowlg  hurry up  wre the next  book! I'll be the first to buy !&quot
I thk  is absolutely potless f Amazoncom to have the plot to this credible book posted f everyone to see  I read this 700 page book   TWO DAYS count 'em TWO because there was no way I could put  down  The  key to the Harry Potter books is to have no knowledge about what is gog  to happen because that just rus the surprise  Stop tellg everyone the  plot  let them discover  through J K Rowlg's best-sellg wds
I have read all four of the Harry Potter books  I thk that this one was the best  a close race wh the third book  This book is much  darker than the previous three yet 's the up  down roller-coaster  that JK Rowlg takes us on that is so facatg  The begug is very  good  sets the whole mood f the book  f once  didn't start on  Harry's birthday  The characts are deep  well defed yet they never  cease to surprise us as many will fd Hermione did  It's hard to get  bed as the sty progresses  people will meat a few new faces an  anoyg repter WITs(wizards  trag) from other schools  as  always a new defense agast the drk arts teacher  Another reason this  book is so good is tha Ms Rowlg stopped wrg exactly what we wanted  to hear  there f made us feel the emotions of the characts me  I  highly recomend this book especially f older readers  My praise goes  out  toMs rowlg f creatg another mastrpeice
I thk the Harry Potter books are the best ever I am the mother of two girls  all three of use have taken turns readg MsRowlgs Harry  Potter books They are very entertag there are not any other books out  there that a parent can read  share wh their kids that are this good   entertagHer books keep adults  children on the edge of their  seats they are a can't put down book They are f kids ages 8 to 108The  three of us can't wa f books 5-6-7 we hope they are out soonthank you  MsRowlgs f your books
I expected to enjoy this book as I had the earlier ones  I was EXTREMELY disappoted  frankly VERY DISTURBED at the overall tone the  series appears to be takg on  I was especially turned off by the tture  scene  Also I felt that the conversations  suations were becomg  much too hateful to be appropriate f most childrien (ie the referral to  the death eater whose job  is &quotdestroyg dangerous beasts&quot who  will have &quotbetter victims than that soon&quot  the talk of beg  ready f &quota spot of Muggle-tture&quot)  Overall this makes me  believe that the this book  probably the future books  they follow  the same tone ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN ( probably not f most  adults)  The characters  the books have begun focusg too much on hate  revenge lies  killg (per Malfoy &quotMudbloods  Muggle-lovers  first&quot)  This has  fact turned me completely off the series  I  will defely not be lookg fward to the next book because  my  opion there was absolutely nothg about this book that was fun  even  mildly entertag
Okay-JKR gets started off on a great note wh year one  Great wrg  The Book self is great ( the Quidch games are the best )  Next  book  Number 2 JKR is slowg down Quidch isn't mentioned as much  The sty  le  is a b blotchy  the mystery unfolds to quickly together  Fnaly the best book  the first four Year 3  Black is the best  character  Quidch is brought back even me  Hagrid is put to the  sty better than ever  You also meet Harry's parents  a way  Last we  come to year 4  Better than year two  about tied wh number one   sty le  But takg out Quidch was a s of all ss!  The triwizard  cup was very very stupid  You would've thought wh so many pages ( over  700 )  This woud be the best of the four  JKR better pick  up PS If  JKR ever happens to read this fish Dumblede's joke from the begg  of the year banquet!
I read the other Harry Potter books  I thk they've been gog downhill after the 1st one  This one was fun to read but the auth ends  up pullg too many rabbs out of  her hat  Characters appear  the  very end who were  long sce dead  she uses too many twists f an  excellent read  It is apparent that this book is just a setup f the  next one  If you like a book that's self contaed wh  faly  the  end - this isn't 
I am stg here  front of my computer browsg through some of the reviews of HP4  somethg jumps out at me  The kids who have wrten  reviews all have  right  If you have not read HP ( I mean all of  them) you really should not be cricizg them  The books are FANTASY  They are not meant to be realistic I mean come on folks  The idea that  these books are puttg heathen ideas  kids heads are just pla stupid  JK Rowlg has done a superb job  carryg on the outstg job she  has done wh HP 12  3  A great read not to be missed by anyone (even   they are Christian!)
I am well to my 30's  I love these books  I have read all four of them  I am currently re-readg them to my soon to be 9 year old son who  cannot wa until I read him the next chapter  Please tell me when the  next book is due to be release?
This is a great book wh a well wked plot although the books seem to be gettg longer  a ltle off topic at some pots I my brother is a  real Harry Potter fan  he recommended them to me (now I like them as  much as him!)  I can't wa f the 5th one to be published along wh  many other people!  F people who thk this is a fad  that the books  are terrible f their emphasis on magic  wchcraft I say this  These  books have a good philosiphey of good over evil  many old fairy tales   even Santa Claus volve magic!
What can I say? I am nteen years old  I am a Harry Potter addict Jk Rowlg does a wonderful job wh goblet of fire the pages just fly by!  Great f kids as well as f adults! I recommend  to anyone!
I love the Harry Potter books I have read all of them 4 times I have already read the second one twice When I first read  I read   half a day maybe a ltle less My friends  I really like Harry Potter Hey!  I even have my own webse f him  the fantasy game my friends  I play!I really really like Harry Potter I LOVE IT! ue It is f ANY ONE AT ANY AGE!
Okay let's put  this way- Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire kicks- well you know what I don't know why I'm wrg this but f those of you  who haven't even started readg Harry Potter all I can say is your crazy!  If you thk this is just another book that is totally bg   unigal you are SO wrong Here's what happens  this book: there's a  Quiddch Wld Cup (yep 's a wizard spt) where the Mark of the dark  ld Voldemt appears Wizards are suspectg he will return to power  aga Then the Triwizard Competion arrives at Hogwarts (the wizardg  school that Harry attends)  Harry mysteriously becomes the FOURTH  champion There's a Yule Ball too  some certa crushes surface Harry  fights dragons merpeople  a maze where he is lead to Voldemt Then  we fd that someone is not who he seems  someone diescool huh? well  i don't want to give out the end cuz that takes all the fun out of readg  the book Enjoy!
I'm not tryg to crisize Rowlg but I just want to keep my comment open ok?In the past the three Harry Potter series had always stuck  to my head whenever I read them no matter which chapter I was readg   I always tried to fish them as soon as possible because  was really  excg as  I was actually  the book wh HP But this time I got so  bed  the begng I can even see f myself that some of the chapters  can be cut shter  the begng! Ftunately from when HP start dog  tasks till the endg  was very good  some are even pretty  suprisg Although HP was not especially good this time I still look  fward to what is comg what HP will do this time when Voldemont had  fally come back full wh power
My children ages 8  10 anxiously awaed the arrival of the fourth Harry Potter book  We were enthralled by the first three but all of us  agree that &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot was very disappotg  several  ways  F example there were several subplots which were never really  developed  should have been left out  An example of this is Hermone's  defense of the House Elves  I thought that  was  particularly bad  taste to have a magical creature which enjoys beg a slave  speaks  a  way which is remiscent of early depictions of black slaves  My children   I had a hard time followg the plot as the book seemed to ramble on  at times  We were also disturbed at how dark this book was  Was there a  reason f Cedric's fate? Why was there so much violence tture murder   profany  a children's book?  This book also lacked the comic relief  of the other books  It was no longer fun to be Harry's friend  Ms  Rowlgs has a responsibilty to do better next time
I have just fished all four books of the Harry Potter series  just under a month  That may not seem that spectacular except f the fact that  I hated to read  I had never read a book as pleasure readg  the last  book I read was required text  college  I was never able to get to a  sty that could hold my terest f very long even when I loved the  subject matter  But then my we an avid reader startg readg the  Harry Potter series  told me how much she loved them  So one day I  decided to start readg the first book  I was stantly hooked  I read  the first book  about three days  started stantly on the rest of the  series  I went from someone who would rather watch TV to someone carryg  my Potter book everywhere I went so I could read a chapter  two whenever  I could  Harry Potter captured my terest so much that I am now explg  other auths to contue this desire to read  If you know someone who has  struggled wh readg  the past I strongly urge you to give him  her  this series
This sty is another achievement f the auth  She contues to keep the saga fresh  terestg  her 4th Harry Potter book  Harry  his  friends seem like real children  the active md of the wrer always  has somethg new  excg wag ahead f them  the wizard wld  Yes this is a big book but what a wonderful accomplishment f a child to  have tackled  completed the sty Parents  teachers should be  thrilled  because once the wld of books is opened to the md the  terest  readg will contue  Bravo to J K Rowlg f makg our  children want to read
A friend turned me  my we onto the Potter mania  I must say I have enjoyed !  We just fished #4  I wasn't as impressed as wh the  others #3 was my fave!  I guess my complat was that of course #4 has  s surprise that you don't expect  twists all your expectations you  have developed about the characters up to that pot  The only problem   #4 was that the shock was so far off  seperated from the ma plot that   took the next 20 pages to expla  catch up wh how this even  could have happened  It felt like the previous 500 pages were a waste  Don't get me wrong I like surprises I just felt like I was left out of  the buildg up to the surprise I underst this is a children's book   adults are often over crical considerg the book's tended audience  I  will defetly read the Potter series too the end!
I found Harry Potter Four to be a very terestg  enjoyable book It was longer than the previous three but takg to account I was readg  to my 12 year old son this was not a problem The adjectives that are  chosen by the auth are of a higher wd level than your average 10 year  old so I thk a child readg this on their own would have dficulty I  did not like the troduction to swear wds  this book  feel the  auth cheapened the sty by havg to rest to usg them I will read  all the HP sequels Great escape!
Okay so my tle is a cheap attempt at brgg over Star Wars' fanatics but anyone readg the Harry Potter series has to notice some similaries  But enough about that  Book four is here  once aga my three girls  went to a deep state of Pottermania  there is no vacce f that  I've checked  My whole family enjoys readg the series as  truly is  great family entertamentOnce aga we fd Harry at the his aunt   uncle's home but this time he is picked up by the Weasleys  taken to  the Quiddch Wld Cup the Super Bowl of the wizard wld  After the  match the dark mark of Ld Voldermont is seen  the sky  wizards  panic everywhereBack at Hogwarts Harry is mysteriously entered to  the Triwizard Tournament  he is suddenly fced to compete  highly  dangerous tasks f the hon of his school  The action throughout the  book is que tense  the excellent wrg makes  really dficult  to put  down  I turned pages so quickly that I didn't even notice the  737 pagesAll of the regulars are back  some terestg new ones  are added  que nicely  In the Goblet of Fire we fally meet  Voldermont face to face as he tries once aga to brg Harry to an  untimely death  Slowly Voldermont is gatherg up his suppters settg  up the upcommg fth book que nicely  The classic conflict of good vs  evil is sensationally defed   will be que terestg to see  where certa characters eventually sideThis novel has somethg f  everybody as the suspense is credible as usual  The Goblet of Fire is  by far the darkest book of the series so far as  deals wh dficult  topics like cheatg  death but J K Rowlg weaves  together so  well you can't help but enjoy this book  This well wrten book is a must  read f any household that has children    It won't let you down  Pottermania is everywhere
In this book children are encouraged to participate  wch craft  It is pollutg their mds  makg them obsessed wh the occult  If you are  a christian I urge you not to buy these books  pray that they will  decrease  populary!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an awesome book!  JK Rowlg does  aga!  But I wouldn't want to read The end at night!  It's  defly wth 's price  This is just about my fave yet!
I know there are alot of people who are reluctant to read any of the harry booksyet they are really are good i'm not even that big of a fictious reader
i am 16 years old  am absolutely captivated by these books i own copies of books 1 2  4  JK Rowlg is a superb wrer wh a  talent that mpst only hope to match My only hope is that she wres  another set of books eher about harry after he leaves the school   about a new character  I py those who shun Harry Potter because they  are missg somethg that only happens once  a letime- a book that  makes kids want to read that makes parents spend me time wh their  children  that makes headles  me papers than can be counted
As a big fan of Harry Potter series I have enjoyed this book very much but  left me wh a very ambivalent feelg which already surfaced as I  was readg the Prisoner of Azkaban The last few books touch upon very  serious issues: betrayal death murder The question of maly is always  addressed  not  a silly way eher Unftunately the book follows  an almost Hollywood style where no matter what the protagonist does -  he survives  comes back better then ever wh an exception that here he  does not get the girl Alas A ltle less predictabily would be nice as  well as movg on to new villas perhaps?  The book is a wthy read  nevertheless  I would certaly recommend  to anyone  everyone who  reads books
This book is absolutely bg!  All the other Harry Potters are okay not good but not bad but this one is very lame  The style needs a lot of  wk because there are too many other sights happeng  This is another  fad like pokemon  Dragonball/Z/GT I'm  the latter one said but this  fad is cloudg other people's mds!  Just because everyone else likes   means that you don't have to like !  There's probably only 10 people who  actually like this book  all the people who say they like  only say  that because their friends like   as they say so  The populary is  cloudg children's mds so they can't choose whether they like    not  They just like  not because the book is good but everyone else  thks s good  that's not very good on today's generation  This book  isn't wth your money n your time like what you like not what other  people like  Save your money  spend  on the Redwall series those  sties wrten by another Brish auth has me action drama  me  fun to read!
I started readg the Harry Potter books right after the fourth one came out  I can tell you I was not dissapoted  My mother my sister   my two best friends had all read them  were beggg me to read them  At  first I resisted  said that they couldn't be all that they were cracked  up to be but I can now tell you just how wrong I was  After startg the  first book (fally) I fished   the other three  one week  I  thk the fourth one is the best even though the endg is a ltle sad  I  have read the Chronicles of Narnia the Ld of the Rgs  the Redwall  series  liked them tremendously  But I have liked none as much as the  Harry Potter books  They deliver everythg a reader wants  I can say  that I am now hooked  Call me a Harry Potter fanatic  you will (I have  now read all four three times) but I thk  is good f kids ( adults  f that matter) to be readg And congrats to JK Rowlg f givg us  these books that are just so good!
This book rocks! Even my dad is readg  F those that don't like fantasy try the Harry Potter series It's great! Goblet of Fire was a b  long (okay really long!)but  was so good I just wanted  to go on  fever Harry gets to do lots of cool stuff  the sty  even gets a  crush on a girl! Rowlg is great at keepg up wh his age  matury  HP4 brgs back a lot of old characters like Dobby You have got to read  HP4!
I'm not sure why JK Rowlg made this book so LONG  It's over 700 pages  I don't really have a problem wh long books  that's the amount  of space they need to wre a compellg sty but this plot drags  too  many places  There were several times where I began to get bed  had  to fce myself to keep readg  where I became so distracted that I had  to re-read the same part because I hadn't been terested enough to pay  attention  This book could have been eded down to a much quicker me  compellg styHOWEVER other than that I thk  was a wonderful  novel  It had all the creative fascatg elements that made the first 3  so great  Floo powder blast ended skrewts the students from Durmstrang   Beauxbatons the Weasley family etc are all unfgettable elementsThis sequel was also much darker than the other 3 particularly at the  end  This didn't bother me actually I thought  was awesome but   might be a b dficult f parents to expla to young children  First  of all several characters are killed cludg an nocent old man  a  student at Harry's school who readers have grown to like  The evil Ld  Voldemt stages a terryg  successful return to power volvg a  disturbg dark rual which cludes self mutilation by one of his  followers  Voldemt then rounds up his followers  attempts to kill  Harry  a rather terryg scene  However this end scene is also one of  the best parts of the book  It is powerful  well wrten drawg the  reader   leavg you unable to stop until the last page  This endg  was what made the whole book wthwhile to me because this is where  everythg comes together to a cohesive whole (not just elements of this  book but of all the 4 Harry Potter novels) answerg most of the  questions but leavg enough open f the next sequel to contueThis  series is growg from an nocent tale of a young boy who discovers he has  amazg powers  legendary parents to a powerful sty of good vs evil  much like the &quotStar Wars&quot movies  I recommend  to anyone who  enjoys a good sci-fi fantasy children's novel  just a good sty  overallovers he has  amazg powers  legendary parents to a powerful sty of good vs evil  much like the &quotStar Wars&quot movies  I recommend  to anyone who  enjoys a good sci-fi fantasy children's novel  just a good sty  overall
Like her previous books Rowlg has wrten another book that is like Bugsbunny cartoons  There is a low level that children will appreciate   there is the higher level that adults will enjoy
This was a great book!  As a Mom of a 10 year old I decided to read the Harry Potter books to see what she was so exced about Well now I know  They are wonderful books especially f Pagan kids It is about time that  wchcraft was looked at as a culture  not a cult  So why did I give   a 4 star? Simple because compared to the first 3 books  dragged on a b  I was not as captivated as the first 3 but I would still suggest buyg   readg the book  My fave part of the book was when he had to go  the  lake wh the mermaidsthrillg!  I have even started readg my five  year old the series A whole family production A good way to get your  child readg!  CAN&quotT WAIT UNTIL THE MOVIE
These books are  the best books ever published I have read them all  I am startg to read them over aga! anyone who hasn't read the Harry  Potter books should start now I STRONGLY suggest them!  The are great  f all aages!  These books have sprired me so much!  I want to be an  auth!
ok so many Chrisans have slammed this book as anti-Christian  stuff sayg how children have joed the church of satan  wish to put curses  on their muggle teachers f givg them low grades but hello? does the  entire communy readg harry potter thk so? i f one am not  a BIG  hurry to spell anyone n learn these curses why? because i just don't!   anyone had any common sense they would realise that harry potter does not  have those 'zap dead everyone' messages  we see sacrices friendship  human-rights  lots me why can't people see that?i guess  has to  do wh each dividual how they read the book  i as a Christian have  not seen my spirual le go down the dra because i just read the book  to enjoy  just read the book  judge f yourself  is really a  waste  jk rowlg stopped the publishg of harry potter because some  people cannot judge right from wrong
This was the best book  the whole entire wld   was defely the best out of all the Harry Potter books! If you haven't yet read the others  i firmly recommend you do! BECAUSE THEY RULE SOOOOO MUCH IT'S AMAZING!
Befe you start your review on this book thk carefully about what you say so you won't look like a complete ignamus Anyone who says this book  is UNREALISTIC is  f a big shock IT'S FANTASY - OF COURSE IT'S  UNREALISTIC Though this book was double the size of Book 3  took a  while to get started when  does you CANNOT put  down Harry is just  as adably confused as befe (even me so wh the troduction of Cho)  Ron is just as degraded  envious as always (watch out f sparks between  the 2!) Hermione (how the HECK do you say her name?) is just as bray   tense as befe (new wd - SPEW) You can expect that ltle  you-know-what Draco Malfoy to be as hideous as his name  his clonies  Crabbe  Goyle (what convenient names) to be as lamebraed as always  Ra Skeeter is a real WITCH  Hagrid gets a taste of romance F all  Quiddch fans -  you can look fward to Harry beg on the sideles   this book as he cheers on Irel  the Quiddch Wld Cup comg to  you at a lovely deserted mo Wh Anti-Muggle charms  the troduction  of Ptkeys you would expect nothg to go wrong But expect just the  oppose! The only thg I can't underst is why they have a Muggle smack  dab  the centre of this You'll know what I'm talkg about when you read  the book A nice new touch to the Hogwarts scene is Ra Skeeter repter  f the Daily Prophet The book is filled wh her articles made very  untruthful by her Quick-Quotes Quill Three of our fave characters get  dragged through the mud! Ah l'ame! Fally Harry is actg like a  nmal boy havg set his eyes on Cho fellow Ravenclaw Seeker  a  fth year Three new wds - Aur Death-Eater  the Dark Mark Three  new magic wds - Prii Incantatem the Pensieve  Veraserum Also  the return of Padfoot  WmtailFilled to the brim wh new thgs  this book will be read  reread despe s size Enjoy!
I really needed a change of pace  my choice of readg material  I found this  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  I felt like  I was 12 years old aga  I would recommend this book to anyone rangg  from young to older new readers to those of all ages  The plot  themes  associated wh this book have demonstrated the why  is no surprise that  this book is so popular throughout our small globe Go Harry  Go!Richard Mudrich
If you have a child under 13 you probably have this book ( the other three) lyg around your house Fd them  read them -  der of  course If you don't have a child under 13 buy them because you're gog  to have a long wa at the libraryThe Harry Potter series is a lot of  fun It's fluff but 's entertag  well wrten fluff It isn't as  smarmy as some children's fiction can be  f that reason  isn't good  f very young readers If your 7 year old desperately wants the book read   to him  her  be prepared to discuss thgs like lyg to parents  cheatg death  evil Also be prepared to spend a LOOOONG time on the  book - 's over 700 pagesIf your children love Harry Potter 's a  great opptuny to start them on other wonderful children's books like  those wrten by Madele L'Engle Cynthia Voigt CS Lewis  many  others
The tle says  all JK has done  aga actually toppg the Prisoner of Azkaban wh another masterpiece!
The &quotHarry Potter&quot series is the most outstg set of books I've read  some time  Most fantasy auths tend to be you wh tryg  to use such  depth language that you lose sight of the sties theme  As  a Christian I am usg the &quotPotter&quot books to teach my children   a way they can relate to of the daily trials of le  Good agast Evil  has been mankds greatest feat  What side to choose  Do you follow what  is easy  do you fight f the convictions you believe to be right   just  I recently had to fly across the Nation (USA) f a family  illness  In h was the fourth book  the &quotHarry Potter&quot  series  Elderly Gentlemen were askg me (I'm 38) about the book  They  were exced  Several commented that  has their Grchildren readg  We need to encourage our youth to read  If we can fd books as excg   enchantg as these than let's keep gog  As a child I read books by  CS Lewis  others that helped me to underst le a lot better  My  Mother bought me book one of &quotHarry Potter&quot  I scowled  This  is a kids book I told her  Then I fally read   Wow!  I could hardly  wa to see what would happen next  I blasted thru the first 3 books then  had to wa (Anxiously) f 6 months f book 4  They say   is wth  havg  is wth wag  Well I truely agree  I now awa the rest of  the series while I try to fd books of terest from others  I may live   the year 2000 but I love thgs like Kgs  Queens Southern Belles  etc  Why beecause Chivalry Lives even  the 21st Century Star Trek Era  Live Love Laugh  enjoy a Honest Le  Serve other's the way Harry  does  you will be Happy
Even better than the first three this book has a great timele  J K Rowlg's style is greatIf you buy just one book  the future this  is future
Harry Potter is one of those rare characters that can capture the imagaation of both children  adults  I would recomend this book to  anyone age 9  up  And f the cynical adult who thks a childrens book  can not hold their terest well I dare you to read the first chapter   not be hooked  Harry Potter is the perfect adult escape from bills taxes  laundry dishes yard wk  traffic jams  Oh   you are a parent  lookg f somethg f your kids to read while they wa f Potter #5  I would recommend anythg by Zilpha Keatley Snyder particular &quotThe  Headless Cupid&quot  &quotThe Egypt Game&quot  This was my fave  auth at age 11  I thk kids who like Potter will like her sties as  well!
I guess I got spoiled readg first 3 books wh my daughter They were funny entertag suspenseful good sty les Not this one From  chapter one  feels like the wrer was struglg wh the plot never  que sure where to turn next The suspense element is not que there   becomes que ridiculous at the announcement of participants  the  tournament Sadly JK Rowlg slows the tempo of this book to a crawl  fillg pages after pages wh potless dialogs meangless suations   colless characters
I just love this auth  She has captured my son's imagation  he devoured this 4th book  only 6 weeks  (Considerg the length of the  book that is really wonderful)  He has read all of the Harry Potter books   can't wa f the next stallment of Harry Hogwarts Hagrid  all  of the rest  If you are a parent  haven't read these books f yourself  you are really missg out on somethg special  They are extremely  detailed  researched  Bravo!  to JK Rowlg  Keep up the good wk   hurry wh the next year at Hogwarts!
hmmm what can i say? this book is a great one  upholds the magic  mystery of the previous three wh the plot twist that makes  a great  read f anyone after i read this book i had to read  agian  go back  to my fave parts becuase  was so well wrten s hard to belive  that all this came from one womans head!  i wa f the next one!
I'm sry  this reveiw upsets the numerous Harry Potter Fan clubsBUT' I just don't see what all the hype is about PLEASE  isn't that good  OKAY I'll adm the first three were absolutely terfic but this one is  rotten Not only is the plot gettg old (People love him  the begg  aga Then people start dislikg him aga Harry Potter defeats  Voldemt aga  is the hero of everythg aga) But  seems to me  's gettg me appropriate f children I'm not talkg about the  size of the book (which is longer than CRIME AND PUNISHMENT) The language  is gettg stronger There is me cursg  the fourth than  the first  three combed And the violence If yuo thought the three were violent  that was baby stuff compared to this Honestly I know a mother who is  readg this to her first grader  stopped  middle She expected  to  be okay f her but  wasn't Come on I know someone out there agrees wh  me What is all the hype about Book stes stayg open till 12:01 on the  night  came out a radio station had a Harry Potter get together I know  plenty of books that are much better that didn't get half the attention  Wake up!
This is the best one yet I'm 14  I've been readg economics books f the past 6 months  this is by far me terestg (Just goes to show  you that these can appeal to anyone) A wthy follow-up to the previous  threeIn response to the 12-year-old  Seattle who called   &quotmediocre&quot I wholeheartedly disagree I tried to read an O'Brien  book but found 's all hopelessly archaic naval terms  leless  &quotadventure&quot Tolkien is excellent but you can't say 's  realistic You have to remember that these are wrten f a younger age  group - 's just that people of any age can enjoy them Very good job I  tip my hat to you JK Rowlg
The Harry Potter books have been pursug me Like Tom Riddle's diary (*Chamber of Secrets*) they just won't go away  Fally I peeked at  *Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone* (which had been slyly lurkg by my  desk just wag to be found)  I was lost Over a thous pages later  I had negotiated all the books gog whout sleep to fish *The Goblet  of Fire* -- even eatg as I turned the pages (I got chili all over my  shirt)  These books are *good*  These books make me want to be fourteen  aga (what me could I possibly say?)  to go to Hogswarts  Heck I  want  all!  I want an owl  I want an visibily cloak  I want a  broom I want to marry Bill Weasley even though I'm old enough to be his  mother  But most of all like the children who read these books I want  the family romance to come true  Surely my true parents were wches   wizards -- how could  not be? And how can I get a lightng bolt scar  whout cheatg?But I have some m (don't send me Howlers!) quibbles  wh all the books  Like Hermione I'm not pleased wh the care of  magical creatures  I'm pretty darn uncomftable wh those house elves  who are happy beg slaves  can't hle their freedom  It's a ltle  too much  bad taste (I'm avoidg the &quotr&quot wd like crazy)  Then there's the hippogrf that's gog to be executed f scratchg a  disobedient  nasty student  We have benign garden gnomes that are swung  until dizzy  then thrown a distance of fty feet  There's an illic  trade  dragons' eggs -- though we know  book 4 that dragons are  protective of those eggs  Stes sell dragon liver by the pound Unicns  have their tail hairs put to ws (so do phoenixes)  Unicn blood  drunk by you-know-who  Mrakes seem very human deed but their fate is  to be chopped up to bs  Spiders are nasty  Snakes don't do well   this wld  The bottom le is that the wizard wld of Harry Potter  treats s magical creatures the way our human wld f the most part  treats s unmagical creatures  Which is to say not well They appear to  exist only to be used by the wizards  wches I don't like thatBut  I love the book  Will  st the test of time?  I don't know  But I do  know that this dark nightmarish funny quirky book makes f a great  read Read  read  me than once  But consider wearg  some of those  seemgly silly ps that Hermione hs out to help the house elvestreats s magical creatures the way our human wld f the most part  treats s unmagical creatures  Which is to say not well They appear to  exist only to be used by the wizards  wches I don't like thatBut  I love the book  Will  st the test of time?

Am I the only person  the wld who thks that this is the most depressg book ever wrten? Am I the only person  the wld who thks that &quotwatchg&quot Harry beg ttured via blood- lettg maj  scar pa the fear of death the death of a friend tryg to save himself  while sufferg from a long - untreated broken leg seeg his dead  parents hearg them scream  Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome from all  this is ENJOYABLE!  Even wse yet the last chapter assures us that this  is only &quotThe Begng&quot of his trials!
I have all four harry potter books  I love them all they just keep gettg better  better when i fished readg the fourth one i must  say that even though  was the best one of them all i was a ltle  depressed(i was depressed cuz i didn't have the 5th one to read) i ended  up readg the whole series aga  now i've started the series a second  time  am on the third book can you tell yet that i like hary  potter?(lol) my fave characters are the weasly tws the dferce  between the 1st-3rd books  the 4th will astound you astound  amaze  you when i say 's dferent i tell the truth but Rowlgs hasn't lost  her touch  you will be missg out on  alot  you don't read 
The Harry Potter series is one of the best series of books I've read  a long time  They are a lot of fun  full of imagation  This is one of  those books that you will be unable to put down while regrettg every page  turned because  is one less page to read  Goblet of fire is my fave  so far  Filled wh the excement of the first three books Rowlg does  an excellent job of keepg the series alive  vibrant  Some auths  have a tendency to bog down  a long series but this is not the case  here  This is a series that is very much wth your time!
Wow!  Rowlgs really outdid herself  the Goblet of Fire  I can't wa f number five to come out  However my kids probably won't be  readg  until they've gotten a lot older  I'm glad my ten year old  didn't fish number fourThe sty was entertag  engagg the  characters were (once aga) so real you could swear you've actually met  some of them  The tensy however was a b much f a kid's book  I  read the last few chapters last night  had a hard time turng off the  light  Rowlgs is so good at makg the characters come alive  she  didn't just do that wh the kids  teachers at Hogwarts  The vivid  descriptions  the fal chapters made my sk crawl  I can't image  how such ge  terr could be displayed  a movie whout gettg an R  ratg
I thought Book 1 was good but Book 2 was better I thought book 3  couldn't get any better but  was better than 2  Book 4 GOBLET OF FIRE  is INCREDIBLE! You've got to read   jo the legions of us that read    recd breakg time  wag wh baed breath f Book 5  Please hurry Miss Rowlg!!!I've never read anythg so mesmerizg!!!
This book was a great page-turner  The mystery of who was plottg to sabotage Harry  return Ld Voldemt to power was so well-crafted that  I had no idea who the bad guy would turn out to be  The descriptions of  the Triwizard Tournament the feign students  the Yule Ball were all  vibrant  fmed their own livg breathg wld  And even though I  knew someone was gog to die  the book when that character did die   was shockg  heart-breakg  A great read f kids  adults (I'm  nearly 30!)
This was a great book  I would recommend  to all  I would also recommend readg the first 3 books  you would get the full impact of  the book  All I can say is I don't know  the 5th book can get any  better but I'll still look fward to 
This book shows the talents of an extremely good auth  a very imagative plot Actually this would be a superb book   werent f  the hero himself Harry Potter Harry is a mean lucky  rather snobbish  character who never deserves the fame he gets In all four books of the  series he defeats his enemy through luck  the help of some other  character He recieves presents anually but NEVER GIVES ANYONE ANYTHING  BACK!  He is rich yet won't spend a cent on his 'friends' I say keep up  the good stytellg great plots  fantastic use of imagation BUT  GET A NEW CHARACTER! Sheesh!PS: Lets not make too many me 700 page  books ok?PPS: Somehow I dont thk those baculars count what was  that he said? &quotI just wont get you Christmas gts&quot What a JERK!
The sequel to the sequel to the starter sty shows strength  suspense   It sends one up sister staircases of spectacular (though seemly simple) styles   I scerely say that there is no substue f    Seriousness segues silless but scal is certaly seen  the sces  of events  Sieves spies  sister villians are scattered to send  clues to the sgle-mded readers  A superb sense of timacy is sneaked  to a settg one can only synthesize from imagation  Secrets   scatterbras are reprieves from the severy of many suations  There is  seldom a slow moment
JK I love you! This book kept me wantg me I didn`t want to let  down  was sooo good I read till my eyes hurt This book is good all through the 734  32 whatever pages The end is soooo werid I didn`t  expect  at all I can`t wa till the movie comes out Buy the book !
When my daughter took her own money bought Goblet of Fire  read  twice  four days I decided I needed to read these books myself  She  sisted I start wh number one  read through which I did  I enjoyed  the books but I found number 4 unsettlg  I notice the suggested age  range is 9 to 12 but I would not give this book to a child under 12  13  Its not the readg level that bothers me  is the content  There is  real cruelty  this book fratricide  the death of an admirable  character essentially because he is so admirable  Also I wonder why we  read so much about James Potter  how much Harry resembles him  Lilly  Potter gets almost no cred f Harry other than his eyes  Maybe I  notice that me as a mom  Aga I like the books  And so does my 14  year old  But I would not give this book unhesatgly to a middle  schooler unlike the first two  PL Travers is a better choice f that  age
JKRowlg does  aga wh her wonderful Harry Potter Series  her latest book Goblet of Fire  Never has there been a better wrten   magically entertag series f children  adults alike  At the  Hogwarts School of Wizardry you will never know what  who is gog to  come poppg to the scene  Magical creatures  Animalmangus leap to  le  this enchantg serial Harry Ron  Hermoe delighted my entire  family  the first 3 books but Goblet of Fire has surpassed them all  Her  suprise endgs are the keep you guessg right till the end  The best  part of beg a &quotMuggle&quot is beg able to read these charmg  sties  Praise to JKRowlg who has captured her own &quotmagical  w&quot that wres these sties  gives her the gt of a magical  imagation
The Goblet of Fire is a very well wrten book JK Rowlg has the best imagation of any auth I've read Her charects are so realistic that I  can relate them to my own frds I especially like all the animals she  makes up f the Care Magical Creatures classes I also thk 's funny  when Harry Ron  Hermione get  to trouble- you'll see what I mean  Everyone will like - I defetely recomend !
Rowlg's 4th book is a great adventure  can be appreciated on many levels  This sty however is about 200 pages too long  As both an  English teacher  a readg specialist I found myself wonderg  she  was beg paid by the page as the plot really drags at times Otherwise  the characters are developed well  the plot is clever  nicely woven  back to the previous books  (I would suggest that Ms Rowlg request her  publisher's Scholastic hire a qualied experienced proofreader wh a  background  grammar as the errs become downright annoyg at times!)   The climax was excellent  the resolution was hled beautully   Lookg fward to #5
F someone who does not usually enjoy fantasy books I was amazed at how enjoyable these books were  I read the first one to see what all the hype  was about  was hooked!  Each book just gets better  better  How  amazg is  f an auth to wre a series of books that appeals to such  a broad range of readers  I'm a 47 yr old mom  we fight over who gets  these first at our houseme my 15 yr old son my 10 yr old daughter   my husb!  What a goldme this auth has led   If you haven't  read these yet start wh the first one  Although I have heard of some  people who didn't like them (Personally I thk there's somethg wrong  wh them) I bet you'll be hooked too  We can't wa until book 5 is  out!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot the fourth Harry book is the best so far  my opion  I enjoyed the way J K Rowlg kept puttg  twists  turns  the plot because they really kept you on your toes  The descriptions were great  the plot was so trigug that I couldn't  put the book down  There is a very big surprise at  the end but I won't ru !  The Potter books just seem to get bigger  every time this one beg a hefty 734 pages!  The books were wrten to be  read  der  you might get confused  you read them out of der  I  would suggest this book to fans of the Enchanted Fest Chronicles  the  other Harry Potter books

Wow! It fally came out! I had been wag like a year to purchase this book   fally came out!  I read  three times  two days To  date I have read  11 times (boy am i proud of that!)It is as good as (  even better than)the previous books!  I thought  was especially clever  that JKRowlg started the book dferently  that Harry FINALLY got to  see a Stg other than his own! I thk  also added a b me flav  when (cough)-one of the people  the book- died Now I can't wa f  the fth book!  Does anyone know when (approximately) when 'll come  out? F those people who haven't yet read a Harry Potter book (whomever  that may be) I really really suggest  gettg one  any way   STARTING TO READ IT!
Harry potter  the goblet of fire is no-doubt about  then to be a five  star book! Even though  is a children's book when i saw how much my  daughter was readg  I had to pick up the book  I found myself  buyg them all  starts off wh a chillg scene about a hounted house  that is beg used as ld voltimts hidout i will not go to detail  because  will mess up the book f you so all I can say is: BUY IT BUY  IT BUY IT!!! It  is really wth  so you can thank me once you are done  enjoyg the book Have fun  get your cred card out now!
I am a true harry potter fan  have read all 4 books Though I was enchanted by the first 3 of this series I felt that the &quotGoblet&quot fell a b sht of my  my friend's who have read  expectationsF example  the begng of the book Hermione decides to defend the  house elfs (like Dobby)  wks hard to create a club  help them As  the book developps this issue is fgotten Hermione fgets to mention   once meI felt that Cedric Driggy's Charachter was NEVER developped    was a pure shock when (read the book  you will underst)  Some of the everyday le at Hogwarts was lost because of JK's  concentration only on the tournamentThe end of the book came as a  total surprise  I felt that JK had been rushed because certa imptant  details have been fgotten Anyways I still liked the book  thk 's REALLY wth buyg I am  just hopg that book 5 will clear all my questions
I have caught the &quotHarry Potter bug&quot but good - I have devoured all of the series  even special dered book number 4 I thk most of  my &quotgrown-up&quot friends thk I'm whacky but my 8-year-old niece  was very jealous when she heard I'd fished the book befe she did! The  latest book 4 kept me readg to the wee small hours  was a  thrillg adventure me serious perhaps than the previous three   stronger f that Readers won't be disappoted - Harry's challenges   fights agast evil are me fun  me spectacular than ever!However the best aspect of the series is not the magic though  is  very entertag but rather the marvelous relationships among Harry  Hermione Ron Sirius Hagred  Ron's family Children  adults alike  will yearn f the fun  adventures  sacrices shared among Harry   his friends - a great lesson f the true meang of friendship And you  just can't help but be impressed by the headmaster who's so wise  noble   understg  cool that he makes me wish I could have been a  student at Hogswts - he GETS !Please believe the hype  just  give Harry a try - he's a welcome addion to the characters populatg the  imagation of our children  cizens today He's not the smartest the  most ambious  even the most talented student but he knows how to be a  good friend (even  he makes mistakes along the way)  me than this  he has that describable qualy of leadership nate wisdom  sheer  bravado that appeals to the hero-lovg human ce of each of us
BUYERS BEWARE !  THIS BOOK CONTAINS UNNECESSARY PROFANITY!I agree wh Barb Schultz's review Children's books should NOT conta profany I'm surprised so very few readers have made any comments on this issue
I read all four Harry Potter books durg the course of a holiday  the US I loved them from the moment I opened Book 2 (the airpt bookshop  didn't have Book 1) but this is the best yet! Incidentally any scnful  Malfoy-type who says Harry Potter is just f kids  sad adults who need  to grow up (I haven't actually heard anyone say that) can go eat their  wds because I am 17  I thk they are a considerable improvement on  sliced breadIn this fourth book JK Rowlg contues to deal wh  creasgly adult themes as her characters grow older These clude the  much-trumpeted death (I won't say whose)  typical secondary school  boy/girl action which might put off some younger readers (under-tens  maybe) Older readers however will sympathise wh Harry  Ron's  frustrations as they try to fd dates f the Yule Ball (I agree Harry  gigglg defely should be made illegal!)As f the actual plot  this is elegantly crafted as  the previous three books  there are me  shocks  scares than ever  the fal chapters Once aga the wealth  of ltle details about the wizardg wld helps to make  all seem  realI have only one complat to make which is that I will now have to  wa nearly a year f Book 5! How will I survive wh no new wizardg  adventures f so long(unless the movie comes out befe then which seems  unlikely)? Maybe I'll just have to try crashg a trolley to the ticket  barrier between platfms 9  10 at Kg's Cross
At first when I heard about the great deal over the Harry Potter books I wondered what the big deal was then I read the book  It actually takes  you to the sties yourself where you share yourself wh Harry  Hermione Ron Hagrid EVERYONE! You cry at the sad parts you laugh at the  funny ones you get anxious  can't stop readg! I actually try to make   last as long as I can because when 's done 's done (though I've  read them over  over aga)  then all the adventure  magic is gone   you're back to the stupid muggle wld aga! This is the best book I  have ever read Someother of my faves are DrDoltle which is a  marvelous fantastically wrten fantacy novel like the Harry Potter novels  the other novel that is my faves is Harriette the Spy which is a lot  like Harry Potter because  is a fantacy mystery etc all mixed together   a perfect combation! And those  examples I thk expla the way I  thk about the Harry Potter! Sometimes you wish that MsRowlg's wld  could be real so much that you actually get yourself thkg  actually  is real  's a real slap--the-face when you step back to realy  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is my fave one of the  four but they're all very good I MOST DEFINITELY recommend that you read  the books You get to know the people side the book  I must tell you  's like makg new friends!  I'm sure that Ms Rowlg surely knows that  so many children look up to her but f some reason I have to get this  out This may seem very stupid deed but she is somewhat like a hero   a great friend of me  I thank her graciously f lettg me  many  others take a small step out of realy f a while! It really means a lot  to me Ms Rowlg you are a remarkable person  I thank you not only  f me but f all the children out there who look up to you! I put my  heart  soul to this last paragragh  I hope you all underst the  way I feel Thank-youyou all underst the  way I feel Thank-you
I am unftunately a ltle b dissapoted by the 4th book I am  completely terried by the thought Ms Rowls would gradually lose her  deve spiration as this book is not really up to her usual  stardsThere are some mismatches that I couldn't accept such as   the Begng of The School Year feast when after the dishes had been  cleaned Moody appears  samples a sausage And what about his wooden  leg? wouldn't you expect such a talented wizard to fix himself a better  sollution? And there's me I have anyway a problem wh Moody as I feel  his character is very stereotypic- as he is described just as your dary  decent retired pirate OK- so his eye's magical stead of patched so  what  Anyway petty as I may sound as a real junky my heart bs very  fast I sweat  breath heavily as I can't wa f the next one to come!  Hope  will be as thick as this one! And hope Lup's back I really miss  him!
This has to be wh my recent memy the most overhyped  overrated piece of fiction juvenile   otherwise  I recall the eveng of s  first day  beg  a Brooklyn coffee shop  seeg sgle adults  enraptured  a manner comparable to when &quotGWTW&quot first appeared   1936 Back then Scarlett was an unknown quanty whereas Harry is now  a pop icon  However I am sry to say the hoopla attendant to his fourth  appearance is not justied  The sty is  overwrten takg a good  hundred  me pages to really  get gog  needs judicious edg   while dark  grim  spots Rowlg is never as darg as we had all  anticipated she would be  When death does occur as deed  does the  impact is less than I might have imaged  The first three  Potters got to the pot  told their sties  They held one spellbound  like serial clfhangers always wantg me  Book number four gives too  much of a good thg missg the mark mataed by the others  It is  amazg to me how the average child will have the patience to wade through  a tome larger than what the average adult reads  Will I  read number5?  Of course Wh characters havg seeped to our  consciousness there is no way Pottermania can be stopped  Too bad that  number four  claimed to be the &quotturng pot&quot  the series  delivers less than what seemed to be promised
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is a book undergog maj speculation by members of the Christian society Many will say that  is full of  antichristian views  even satanic I read recently  an news article I  recieved from a friend of me that the book is sparkg satanism   children  that JK Rowlg is a satanist herself who made some pretty  anti-christian comments I f one believe that this is ludicrous a book  supptg the struggle of good over evil where good always ws is not  exactly a satanic view Also there is a quote  the fourth book where  Albus Dumbled says &quotcuriosy is not a s&quot That is not  satanic  ant-ichristian no matter how you may try to put  This whole  Harry Potter is wichcraft  non christian is stupid but you never  know The only way to fd out is to talk to the woman herself The book  self was absolutely fantastic I read   two days   as s  predecesss left just enough room f the fth book wich will probably be  recieved even me fanatically than this one The only thg that could be  a turnoff is the death I won't disclose the fmation as to who but I  will say that  makes sense It's not as  the character could have  escaped that would have been dficult to do  their character fbids  them to act dferently than he did causg them to be put to their  prediciment I always read the book to my mom  my sister  toward the  middle of the sty my mom asked who the person who put Harry's name  the  goblet was I asked  she really wanted to know  told her that she  would still be suprised  the end even  I did Wich is true the suprise  twist at the end furiates  at first confuses but only adds to the  wonderfull suspense only Rowlg can weave to her wrightg I would  recomend this book to a slightly older audience than the first three but   was still fantastic
Holy dements!what can I add to about 3000 reviews?  Well let me try a dferent approach pchg this review to those of you avoidg  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot (as well as the series) because you don't care  much f the fantasy genre let alone the kd that wks so many kids to  a frenzy I never cared much f fantasy myself It was always dficult  to wk up terest  wks that created umpteen dferent ltle  characters wh varyg powers  talents scattered across ls that  are only clearly imaged  the auth's head  Mapsappendices  glossaries -- who needs all that!  But then comes this wonderful  sanely imagative wrer named JK Rowlg  Oh JK what have you  done to me?  Turned me to a reader of books that kids are wild about!  But me imptantly how?  Well here's what I suspect: Rowlg  unlike many other fantasy auths has been clever enough to capture a  sense of BALANCE between her fantasy wld  the real wld that we all  share  Hogwart's f all 's magical passageways ghosts  other  quirks IS  many ways similar to the real schools  colleges that we  have attended  The magic  wchcraft professs share many odd   charmg tras that you DO see  their real-le counterparts ( as an  academic I can assure you there really ARE Lockharts Dumbledes  Trelawneys  Snapes out there!)  Every kid has  one way  another  seen home as a st of &quotprison&quot at times  longed f some  degree of power over suations  The magic of Harry Potter is the magic of  our own human aspirations  And  is put fth  a wld that while  fantastical has enough similary to our own that we can feel very much  me a part of   I know I know the Potter books have become a huge  mass-market success but Rowlg is a maj lerary talent even  spe  of all that hoopla  Meover she was clever enough to anticipate the  paranoia of some readers over books about wizards  wches  gently  but deservedly parodies them  the fm of certa &quotmuggles&quot  So  you thk fantasy is not f you please give Harry Potter a try  these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receivg  And  thanks JK f showg a wld of readers that magic does exist  every  nook  cranny of our lives!over books about wizards  wches  gently  but deservedly parodies them  the fm of certa &quotmuggles&quot  So  you thk fantasy is not f you please give Harry Potter a try  these books really DO live up to all the hype they've been receivg  And  thanks JK f showg a wld of readers that magic does exist  every  nook  cranny of our lives!
I recieved the lastest stallment of Harry Potter 2 days ago f my 26th  birthday  Needless to say I found  a compelg read as I have now  fished   I truly expected this one to be the Empire Strikes back of  the Harry Potter books  I was not disappoted  I am also very pleased  that so much of  was kept secret  that I managed to avoid any spoilers  until after I was done I do thk however that due to the darkness of the  book that 10 years old is about the youngest age that should read   I  found myself a ltle b on edge once I was done readg  Basically  this is a wonderful book  the descriptions go beyond fantastic  I can't  wa until the next book comes out
A project another project but this one is about someone she knew nothg about Vada Sultenfuss is  English  the day is almost over In the  last few mutes of class she was told that she had to do a project When  the teacher asked who she was gog to do  on she said she would do  on  her motherWhen she sais that the class was silent  The next week was  sprg break so she wanted to go to LA to see  she could fd anythg  out about her mother's le After fally persuadg her dad to let her  go she was of to LA When she got to the airp she was supposed to fd  a boy named Nick who would take her to her uncle Lucky f her she fds  him  Unlucky f her he has a bad attude Nevertheless the two of them  get a taxi  are off to her uncle's house  F the next five days of  her search f fmation about her mother nothg but misftune cane  her way These adventures create an enjoyablebook that I thk any girl who  likes adventures will have trouble puttg  down until the last page
I will adm  I was addicted to Harry Potter  A few thgs I would like to say though about why I gave  4  not 5 stars  The wrg is  whimsical  fun but the characters lack depth of great books  After the  first chapter the book got bg f the next few  Also the book on the  whole did not seem as excg as the third book  Don't get me wrong  though  I loved the book  Oh yeah I am dreadg the openg of the  movie Harry Potter  The Scerers Stone movie almost always butcher  good books  If you want a book that is a ltle me deep but also  the  same kd of Fantasy genre read Sabriel by Garth Nix  the Golden  Compass by Phillip Pullman
  )  WOW! this book was one great adventure August 14 2000  Reviewer: Richard J Parico (see me  about me) from Lcoln Univ PA Uned States This is by far the greatest  of the four books The way the auth keep you  suspense from page to  page The way she keep the sty  high  tense action around each  coner Harry becomg me powerful  at the same time wiser  the  wizerdg wld around him And his Quiddch skills just blow you away   readg about the triwizard cup was really great I really love this  book  i recomend this book to anyone who hasnt read  peace out JESS!  DID U FIND THIS HELPFUL? YES  NO
This is an absoulote must read book! This book is a great combation of adventuremystery  fantasyIt doesn't even matter that much  you  haven't read the first 3 Harry Potter books (I still recomend them They're  really cool books too! ) Because through the book  explas what thgs  are such as Harry's Histy  what Muggles are  everythg like that  OverallThis is the best book  the WORLD! You Should defately buy It  is a great read f all ages! If you do decide to buy (which I thk you  should) HAPPY READING!Later people! From Giselle(aged 11)
I thk this book is one of the best Harry Potter books yet! It's somethg dferent compared to the other three books out I like how JK  Rowlg came up wh the idea of havg a surprise event at Hogwarts I was  gettg tired of readg about Quiddch  the other books although there  was some of   this one I loved Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I couldn't put  down! I can't wa 'til the 5th one comes out!
Wow that's what I said when I fished Potter 4 I was amazed by the depth  humour of the book I didn't fd out about them till the 3rd  book came out  I almost cried when I had to wa a year f the fourth  All my books have broken bdg the 3rd is broken  about 7 places   I'm not kiddg the 1st just started to break  3 places  the the  wrg on the first three's spe is just about gone Goblet still hasn't  broken but 's just a matter of time
JK Rowlg was very liberal wh her wrg  this stallment of the Harry Potter series  At over 700 pages this book is a heavyweight!  HARRY  POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE has a dferent feel than s predecesss --  a b darker que a b longer (wh no detail left out)  a b me  mature  Harry is defely gettg older   shows  this bookIn  Harry Potter IV the sty gets deeper the plot thickens  the evil is  me serious  We learn a great deal about many thgs  Potter's wld   we get to know some fave characters even better  Of course there  are a few new characters most notably the new Defense Agast the Dark  Arts teacher Mad-Eye Moody who is one of the best characters to date   this seriesReaders of the first three books have no choice but to read  this book  they won't be disappoted!  Rowlg serves up a hungry-man  ption of mystery magic fantasy  fun  this hefty novelIf you  still haven't read the first three books read them right away  then  tuck to the new book!  If you enjoy the readgs of Roald Dahl CS  Lewis  Madelee L'engle the Harry Potter series is a MUST READ
I'm a 45 year old mother of 3 children ages 9-13 I have read all 4 of the Harry Potter books  have had a hard time wag f each one to come  out  prt JK Rowlg has a great imagation f all the dferent  ways she has found to troduce new animals  characters to her wonderful  books  Keep them comg JK f your wk is not just f the kids but  f those adults who like to let their mds soar wh the wild birds that  are the paters of imagation  Thank  you Marti Lozer
To me this was book was Great!  has bs wh mystery bs wh action bs that you gasp to  other wds Rowlg did  aga  anythg better than befe! My fave part was the whole thg!
This is one of the best books that I've ever read The only others that come close to beatg  are the first 3  the series I didn't actually buy any of them f myself - my brother did but everytime he put  down  I'd pick  up f a sneaky read I feel like I know Harry  I miss him  when I actually remember that I can't speak to him like my other friends I  will always believe though that magic is real Hogwarts is real  Harry  is real even  s only  my imagation
I thk Rowlg is an excellent wrer  the sense that the reader is compelled to keep turng the pages  We want to know what happens next  However I did not like the 4th book -- even though I couldn't put  down  In the 1st 3 books I thought  would be great to be part of the wizard  wld  be able to go off to Hogwarts to study under the famed Albus  Dumblede After the Mad Eye Moody swch however I have no fah that  Dumblede actually is Dumblede  that Hogwarts is any better than the  streets of NYC  Might as well be a Muggle  Book 4 is nothg me than  another Star Wars sty wh Harry Potter as Luke Skywalker  Voldmt as  Darth Vader  I liked Harry Potter igally because I wanted to enter  to a wld of magic  In the 4th book I found myself readg a crime  sty   filled my head up wh children dyg  adults trickg   abusg children It reaffirmed f me that  is better not to trust  anyone Certaly not the adults that are &quotpretendg&quot to be your  protect  What will happen next?  Will Hermione turn out to be Voldmt's  assistant  does she die some hrible death as well  No me Harry  Potter f me  I can just watch television to get that kd of violence
I call this the best of the best because the Harry Potter series is the best series of books I've read  the fourth book Goblet of Fire was by far the best  This book has everythg I like while readg suspense  characters I can relate to adventure action mystery magicetc  I  am only fourteen so I can very easily relate to the characters as they grow  older  (Especially Hermione-I'm a ltle like her)  I love this book so  much I have read  about a million times  Okay only three but close  enough!  If you read this book  like  read  aga  you will fd  pots you missed the first time around but now make sense  If you read    don't like  wellthere's somethg wrong wh you!
I saw this book  the school library  read  to see what all the fuss was about  as I suspected  was nothg special I can underst why  the prospect of a boy wh magical powers would appeal to young readers   the auth makes the characters realistic  likeable   's a baddie  very unlikeable Your kept  suspence befe events like the quidiche cup  but when the event actually happens I fd  que bg  badly  thought out there was ltle thought put to how magic was done the  wizards just wave their ws  say some wds  the spell wks   although all the magical gizmos are fun to read about 's pretty easy to  thk up somethg like the omnoculers  you can expla how they wk by  just sayg their magical The attempt at a twist at the end where moodys  fm was beg used by a deatheater was very dary  wasn't  predictable but when a character's brought to the book made out that he's  good then right at the end of the book when I found out that a deatheater  was usg his fm I dd't feel particularily impressed Defately  nothg special
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire like 's precedg fellows  the series has become a BIG h Wh the same great magic mystery   suspence which JK Rowlg has supplied to each book combed wh the  many thrills chills  spills throughout 's 700+ pages makes   imposible to put down! You can enjoy plenty of Qutich at the Qutich  Wld Cup experce new dangers  the Triwizard tournament right along  wh Harry meet a hfull of new characters  of course have yet  another le threateng encounter wh You-know-who I truly believe that  wh &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot JK Rowlg has once  aga captured the hearts of all those young  young at heart who still  remember how to wish  dream
I have always enjoyed readg  wanted to share this joy wh my 3 young children  When I first heard about Harry Potter through my mother who  wanted to give the audio cassette as a Christmas gt to my 8 year-old son  I was a b doubtful  My son had learned how to read  English  French  but couldn't make the transion to novels whout pictures  would only  read Asterix  Tt  The audio cassette got him hooked  soon we were  both listeng to  then gradually readg as we listened  at the end  he was followg on his own  The followg books were all read whout the  audio versions  he read the last  a mere week  Havg read the books  myself I fd them very excg  challengg  many respects: the  vocabulary is varied  advanced whout draggg down the sty  The  auth uses great creativy  choosg the names of characters spts  localies etc  The plot is very closely kn  very credible (as long  as you believe  the premise of magic)  The background is one most can  relate to: there is a strong sense of family values of friendship  responsibilies of school excement of spts  sht  is the le  of most young boys wh magic thrown  not to make le easier on the  contrary Harry battles wh credible foes  must show tegry   courage to succeed  In a way he is a hero that boys can relate to not a  strong powerful man but a simple BOY not particularly good-lookg   cute (he wears glasses  has unruly hair) who must go to school   learn  has his share of problems to solve as  beg sometimes shunned  by others  by his best friend not suceedg  certa subjects havg  a teacher hate him  all the other problems wh Voldermt  These books  have taught my son to enjoy readg the greatest accomplishment of all  I  have mixed emotions about a movie  Will the children simply wa f the  movie version to come out stead of readg  IMAGINING the sties?INING the sties?
This book was the coolest Jk Rowlg did a excellent job of wrg  I fd this book was excg  sad It looks long but once you get to   you will want  to be longer I read  is a 3 days Thats 200 pages a  day!  Wheather you an old  young you will love this book
Fantasy  science fiction puts people  suations that don't exist  then looks at how they react  Sometimes  is exactly the same as they  would react here  now  In der to veil the maly a b me  strongly you might have some current thoughts  actions removed only to  be replaced by others wh the same motivationsThis book took compellg  characters  put them  a settg of existg government society  sensibilies  prejudices then renamed them  Some magic was thrown I  enjoyed the book even though  felt like a 700 page setup f book 5  Some of that may be because Harry is older  not every issue is black   whe  Darker grey can't be changed by sgle heroic acts
This is by far the best book I have ever read The whole series was absolutely WONDERFUL! I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to  fd out how far the imagation can really stretch When I startg  readg the first book &quotHarry Potter  the Scerer's Stone&quot  I thought that the first chapter was kd of dull Then once you get to  the book  so great you cannot put  down Whenever I fished the fourth  book I read the whole series aga It is amazg how many thgs you miss  when you only read them once! My overall opion of this book  the  entire series is excellent! Please read them!
Yes the fourth book  the Harry Potter series deserves 5 stars as the first 3 books also did And yes 's also much better than I expected I  was sceptical about the auth's abily to wre the fourth book because  of all the pressure of so many people breathlessly wag f Also  the first 3 books covered all sts of stuff had many twists &amp turns  lots of humour &amp lots of fmation on the characters So I thought   was kd of hard to match up to all that Was I right? No!(luckily f  me &amp everybody else)I thk the Goblet of Fire is the best so far   the series f 2 simple reasons: a) 's almost tripple the size of the  previous books ( resembles a small dictionary &amp almost scares you off  when you first lay eyes on ) so 's even bigger a success sce  JKRowlg manages to keep you surprised &amp anxious throughout the  whole thg &amp b) this book marks a st of turng pot  the series  which you'll fd out when reachg the last page But enough said already  If you belong to the small my that hasn't yet enjoyed the Harry  Potter books stop resistg &amp start readg: 's one of those few  cases when beg  the my doesn't have anythg good about -  you're just missg a rare treat!
Well here I am aga at the end of book 4  I wrote a review on book 1 only  FEW SHORT WEEKS AGO!  It certaly did not take me long - 2 days to fish #4 Now that I am me familiar wh the characters a few thgs I  would love to see  #5  First can we please fd out a ltle me about  Dumblede  Snape (actually startg to like the snake) Profess  McGonnagall  I thk 's time  They are such an tricate part    would be nice to fd out a ltle b me about them  And hopefully  Rowlg will grant our wishes  She certaly sets  up  book 4 - there  are tidbs all over the book on the sties of these 3 imptant figures   Harry's le but we get waylaid  I actually liked the  &quotdarkness&quot of the book the layers are buildg on each other  And f those of us wh romantic hearts you can even fd a ltle of  that too (even  's 14 year old romance) I certaly hope she is  wkg on #5
A friend of me whom recently vised me from Boston on July 6th was estatic wh the realization that  only a few days the fourth Harry  Potter book would be available to JK Rowlg-Junkies all over the wld  I scoffed at her (yes really I scoffed) sayg that I n could she  fd amusement  temptation  a series of books that my ten-year old  sister has been readg  So  der to underst the frenzy  mania  over Harry Potter I played devil's advocate  picked up the first book   the series did not put  down until I fished  four hours  later  Though clearly a childern's book  is also clearly an age-less  classic that will rema as famous  cherrished as Tolkien's 'The  Hobb'  I quickly read the next three books  the series  found  each to be as unique  trigug as Harry Potter himself  Ms Rowlg  is a genius simple pure  honest  I fd myself anticipatg the  fth book as  I were aga a child perhaps that's the charisma of  the Harry Potter books- awakens the long-sleepg child that dwells  wh us all
When I first saw Harry Potter  our library I barely even picked up a fger to get    consequence I wasn't the first to read   However after that  was like a flood of people were at our library to  read    the desperation f the 2nd book I fgot about the  library  bought  myself  Then the third  However after fdg  out that  would be another year befe the 4th  I was always thkg  about  I knew I was hooked  The fourth book is defely the best yet  detailg Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts  However there is a  surprise  the begng which I will not state to conta the suspense  f other readers  While at Hogwarts Harry  the gang fd out that the  Quiddch Cup tournament was canceled but  was replaced by the Triwizard  Tournament where the best 3 schools compete to w Even though  may be  700+ pages  will be wth the read adults  children will both be  drawn to JK Rowlg's tricate web of mystery  imagation  Buy   f your kids  yourself you will thank me later =)
As an adult readg the Potter books this was the best so far  I couldn't put  down but didn't want  to end  Each page brought  somethg new from JK Rowlg's vivid imagation  I can't wa f #5   I dearly hope 's as long  not longer
This book was awesome!  I sed through   one day  I couldn't put  down  WHen I trierd my md would wer back to   I would contue readg
As a 50-year-old educat I am thrilled wh the excement  enthusiasm JK Rowlgs has created  readg I waed all day Saturday  July 8 f the FedEx truck to deliver HP IV to my anxious  grsonHavg read all four HP books I am marveled wh Ms Rowlg's  wonderful imagation  cleaver use of new wds  However I am  extremely disappoted wh the use of use of hell  damm  &quotGoblet  of Fire&quot  Perhaps a Muggle would use these expressions but  is not  necessary  a children's bookI don't claim to have Ms Rowlgs talent  f wds but  seems that on page 43 Mr Weasley might have said  "Dungbomb "  "Curses" when he found the fireplace blocked  As f Bill  Weasley on p62 I cannot believe Mrs Weasley didn't wave her w  have  a bar of soap appear  Bill's mouth Me appropriate would have been  "Mum the bank doesn't give a blasted ended skrewt how I dress as long as I  brg home plenty of treasure  Although Snape  Cedric may have had  good reason to use damm  hell I believe Ms Rowlgs could have made up  somethg else
Harry Potter is of on another adventure! He fally goes to the Quiddch Wld Cup wh Hermione  the Weasleysthe Weasley Tws  (Gege&ampFred) bet all their money on Irel to wbut Vikt Krum  from the other team to catch the snch wh Ludo Bagman Indeed the tws  were crectbut Bagman doesn't give them their money! The old Death Eaters  come out aga  parade aroud dog terrible thgs to  muggles(non-magical folk) Someone (Crouch's son) steals Harry's w   conjures the Death MarkEveryone gets scared Harry  Ron were gettg  annoyed at the fact that everyone kept sayg  was gog to be an  excg year at Hogwartsbut doesn't tell them! What  is is that  everyone is talkg about is the Tri-Wizard Tournament(a tournetment  between the three biggest Wizard schoolsHogwartsDrumstang  Beauxbaton) One student from each school is chosen but you have to be  older than 17 to do  The tournament hasn't gone on f over a century  because of casualties Someone (Crouch's Son) has entered Harry's name as  another school  there is four contestants steed of three Harry Potter  (Hogwarts) Cedric Diggy (Hogwarts) Fleur Delacour (Beauxbaton)  Vikt Krum (Durmstrang) are to compete  the Tri-Wizard Tournament! To  fd out who ws after the three tasks read Harry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire! Warng: You must read all of the other 3 first   will be very  confusg  one of the contestants  the end will be killed by Ld  Voldemt (also known as Tom Marvolo Riddle):) It's a wonderful book!  Magnicent! I'm a Harry Potter fan! I love Hermione Granger  Ron  Weasley too! The whole Weasley family is loveable too! I wish Hogwarts was  real so I could go there too!
I really enjoyed this one!  I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books so far but this one was extra long so the auth had lots of time to  develop characters  suations  this made  even better!  I took  this one on vacation even though  was very heavy but  was wth !  I hope 's not too long befe the next one comes out!
No matter your age background  whether you're a muggle  Squib you can enjoy this book Like 's three previous siblgs  rises above the  call of greatness but this one is even better than the others The Harry  Potter collection actually gets better as  goes on amazgly enough So  far I've read this 734 page page-turner 3 times  I still love  Go  out  get this book (although you should read the first 3 first!)
Wonderful book but is f adolescents F a me adult version try &quotEncounters wh a Prophet&quot
This book is so creative  JK Rowlg offers wonderful images f us  her very special way  This is not just a book f children  Any adult  wh a love f the unexpected adventure will ade this book
This book the fourth  the HP series is by far the best - not to mention the longest at 734 pages  It is defely much me mature than  the first three books -  rightly so f Harry is growg up  The  students don't even get to Hogwarts until 150 pages to the book because  the plot is so detailed  tricate that you must first go through a  month  so of events  Harry's summer  This book is a must f anyone  who eher A) likes to read B) likes to be entertaed  C) is a human  beg  EVERYONE no matter how old would enjoy this book  Harry Ron   Hermione although they are wizards are still human teenagers  the  perceive thgs  act accdgly - they act &quotreal&quot  This book  is so amazgly creative that you'll be sad when you reach page 734  You  will not want to pu  down
JK Rowlg should have stopped while she was ahead The fourth book is so long that 3/4 of  is sufferably bg The Quiddch game at the  begng had me yawng Yes the end becomes excg ( may  lead to other terestg books  the future) but this one was  disappotg It didn't meet my expectations
This book by far tops all the other three precedg  The mixture of a warm rich text  bold mental imagery pull you right to the wld of Harry Potter This book has everythg comedic les tense mystery   suspense Joanne Rowlg pulls all of her creative talents together   delivers the goods One can only hope she can match this book If your  sceptical about readg a so called &quotchildren's book&quot thk  aga  go pick up a copy 'cause 'll be years befe you get  from  the library The only thg left to say after readg this book is  &quotBravo! Bravo ENCORE!&quot
I wrote a review f the first Harry Potter book but after chompg through the entire series this past week I can do naught to resist wrg  anotherI honestly am not sure how she does   Her prose is nothg  spectacular but her characters draw me right   's as  f a few  hours at a time I become Harry Potter  feel what he feels  JK  Rowlg is now officially the third of my very fave fantasy auths  ever - right up there wh Orson Scott Card  Terry Goodkd (though be  warned Goodkd's series is adult only  a LOT darker)  Let me  just emphasize I am not a bld lover of all fantasy out there - many of  the popular auths especially Robert Jdan  David Eddgs make me  want to retch  I honestly can't see how people can read one of their  shallow books  have any desire to contue another page to the series  Rowlg however is far from anythg close to Shallow  tre  Now f my specic comments about this book -  was too sht!  Yes yes  I knowbut those 734 pages went by about as quick as one page of Eddgs  As usual I enjoyed the surprise at the end  am becomg especially  trigued at Harry  Ron's relationship to Hermione  I was honestly  disappoted when Rowlg started htg at some potential f romance  between Hermione  Ron( isn't Vict Krum a b old f her!  We're  talkg statuty here!) - I was always kd of hopg she would end up  wh Harry  one of the last books  the series( I hope he eventually  fgets about that bimbo Cho Chang) but the ambiguous last page of this  one gave me a b of hope f that  But mostly I'm disappoted that  I'll have aged another year befe the next book  Only Goodkd's next  book can hope to keep me entertaed f a sht while longer  Yes once  aga Harry Potter has become one of my all time fave series'  Dear  ld I'm a twenty-two year old boybut heck I'm not ashamed at my  decided lack of cynicism  banaly  :)lack of cynicism  banaly  :)

This a great book f children -- f adults be sure to read Clyde Lewis' &quotEncounter wh a Prophet&quot It's truly powerful  carries a  message we all need to hear
When this book came out I was credibly anxious I had my mom drive me to three bookstes - I fally found  at the third I started readg   as soon as I got home  I fished readg  the same day I could NOT  put  down I was walkg around readg  I ate my dner readg  I  even chose to take a bath stead of a shower so that I could contue  readg   the bathtub! This book is about twice the length of the third  book but the longer the better It's a ltle darker than the other books   geared a ltle b towards older readers - 's got a swear  two  but not many - but 's just as wonderful as the others  not me I'm  14 years old  I get a feelg these books are f readers from ages 8  to 108 there's really no age lim There's a shockg endg - I won't  tell you what don't want to ru the book The only thg I didn't like  about  was that  took que awhile f the old gang to get back  together agaI was tempted to skip the first chapter but don't -   you do you won't underst the rest of the book However the rest of the  book by FAR makes up f the slow begng
I thk this book is great as good as all the others  Clever plot lots of variety new characters  the sty keeps movg  I was pleased that  the book was so long as I read real quick   was nice to have somethg  I could enjoy f me than a mng  Rowlg is lettg the characters  grow up whout removg their appeal  she's lettg puberty come   whout  takg over the whole sty  The only thg is that this book  depresses me  I read  to the end as there is no reassurance that  everythg will be OK  Maybe some kids will fd  a b scary I don't  know  As to the people who say that magic  the books is badwell I  know the Bible doesn't like magic but  doesn't like murder eher   the paper has stuff on that all the time  We can't shut our eyes to thgs  we thk are bad fever  Rowlg's plots are brilliant  never  predictable  I can't wa f book 5
It isn't often that an auth produces a series of books where each new book is better than the last but J K Rowlg does  consistently  The  Harry Potter books are wonderful f a variety of reasons but the chief  one is that Rowlg wres what she would like to read  The Goblet of Fire  is the longest  darkest of the series to date but a brilliant  transional book  There were three passages  the book that lerally  reduced me to tears while others made me laugh out loud  I am a 50 year  old biology prof- but I am ready to go to Hogwarts at the drop of an owl  post  If only

ANy person who liked the first three will defaly like The Goblet of Fire There are many new characters Once you get started you will never  stop
Like so many other adults I have enjoyed followg Harry through his first three years at Hogwarts  However Ms Rowlg's latest stallment came up  que sht of her previous books  Her prose makes f easy readg   her knack f creatg tension  anticipation are undeniable but wh  &quotGoblet&quot she seems to haven fallen  a b of fmulatic trap:  Harry is unhappy durg his summer vacation - he gets back to Hogwarts   everyone is mean to him - Harry is  mtal danger - Hagrid needs cheerg  up - there is a show down wh Voldemt which the rest of the wizard wld  never fds out about - Harry is comfted by his best friends  I thk  there was a great book  Goblet Unftunately not enough time was  devoted to the development of the characters of Harry Ron &amp Hermione  Rather oddly they were much me shallow  this latest stallment I'm  cheerg f Harry  therefe hope Ms Rowlg tightens up her wrg   the several books
I had to control myself from jumpg to the last page because I wanted to enjoy each page Each page self is enjoyable but not the aftertaste It  doesn't f the crerium of &quotunexpected but reasonable&quot of a  perfect fiction If Voldemt can use the strategy by the end why not  anytime earlier  any place other than Hogwarts? After readg this one  I'm me eager to see the 5th book just hoppg the 5th can be better than  this one I agree wh some readers that the third is the best followed by  the first  then the second The fourth although funny  excg but  a ltle b less
Fally  the latest stallment arrived This one is the best ! Although lots of kids may not feel comft about some part of the sty  I feel a  b annoy  the middle because thgs seem to be too easy but the last 200  pages expla  all ! I can't hardly wa  f the next one after that  enthralled endg Reed ! Love !  Bless U Ms Rowlg! And keep  Wrutg!
i haven't read sty books after i started to wk but the Harry Potter series is really amazg! i'm wag f book 5 ( fact not only me my  sister  brother are wag as well!)
I had put off readg these f so long because I had automatically assumed that they were kid's books Well they aren't they can easily be  enjoyed by adults as wellAs I was sayg I had put off readg the  Potter series until 5 days ago I had spent the last 5 days stayg up till  3 AM (yes i woke up at noon but thats beyond the pot)each day readg  these books They are highly addictive  fun While the sty outle is  always predictable: Harry has unpleasant le wh Dursleys Harry goes to  Hogwarts where he faces challanges that only HE  his friends can solve  Harry manages to defeat great evil  one way  another Harry is praised  by everyone (except the Slythers) The styLINE is full of surprises  You can never tell who the ma &quotvilla&quot is until the end  This coupled wh the fact that the book's focus is always around Harry (so  you don't have to follow 5 sty-les at once)  Rowlg's great sense  of hum makes f some very addictive readg The nature of the magic   these books is less &quotrealistic&quot than  other fantasy books  because  doesn't really follow any specic rules but  you don't take   too seriously  shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of the books So  far these books have proved to be entertag I scerely (sp?) hope that  Rowlg keeps this up
What`s  wh Harry?  Why we cannot stop readg ?  Why  has capture the spare free hours we have?  I do not know the answer  but perhaps the  possibilty ro run aloof at Hogwarts f a few moments  cheer Irel to  w the falNonetheless  I expected a b me  It`s terestg  the new twist (Ron  Harry`s fights  the realisation that girls now  exist not only as pals but also as objects od desire  the jealousness   yes  I would love to meet a veela)I do not fd a solid plot (what  about Voldermt  Wmtail: arent we talkg here about the eternal good  vs evil fight?  Their presence is scattered  their are seldom plotted  as the very bad guys we love to hateBut Harry `s like a drug:  you  must take  you are trapped to    s good!A ltle b of fun   this gray le is wth the efft
Sshh - the readg level of this book is 9-12 I really enjoyed   I'm 34! I grew up readg fantasy sties full of wizards  magic elves   gobls wlds where almost anythg can happen It's be wrong   unhelpful to compare this book to say Ld of the Rgs (this is a  children's book whereas Ld of the Rgs is not) In Goblet of Fire JK  Rowlg has come up wh another excellent tale that is entertag   fun to read  Compared to the previous three Harry books this one is a  ltle darker wh the reader holdg his/her breath as Harry moves from  adventure to adventureOur hero is gettg older he's growg   learng new thgs  that is the deeper message of this book As we grow   develop we will experience a whole range of new thgs beg  groups   teams the need f friendship the imptance of wkg towards the  goals we all set - whether as children  as adultsIf you're a fan of  the previous books then you'll know what to expect of the fourth the depth  of sty the twists  turns  the plot You will be exced  amused  wh shoutg team badges w duels quirky humour  pun after pun  JK Rowlg wres wh a great talent these books are wrten wh a  sense of imagation  fun that immediately appeal to children of all  ages - even those who are 34!
First off this book was not an amazg achievement  the lerary wld  Many auths have wrten books that have far surpassed this novel that  basically cuts styles from the other three novles  jams them   here  Secondly I liked Rowlg the first time when her name was Rhoad  Dahl her wrg style is almost identicalNow adressg this whole  cencship thg because of the (threateng music) &quotWhcraft&quot  volved  The Christan Coalon has no right to make their po attempts  to deprive this novel of sales  The Wchraft used  the book is  no  way depictg evil  The wchcraft  the book is like slapstick whcraft  wh the tradional &quotEye of Newt&quot type of hokey magic  Overall  buy the book just to see what is gog onbut don't s  wa around  f the next stallments
I stumbled to the wld of JK Rowlg's Harry Potter through my eight year old nephew who received the book from his mother's friend Ltle had  she known that my nephew would bedly igne my readg of the book   that I would fall dangerously  love yes  love wh the sty of the  muggle raised phan wizard I have read a lot of books but Harry Potter  easily reaches the top of my list The well rounded  easily believable  characters the small  simple (but hard to discover- f me!) mysteries   her simplistic  easy to read style makes this book  the previous  three hard to put down I am almost obsessg over the next book so much  so that  is very dficult f me to get back to Jane Eyre the book I  was readg befe Goblet of Fire terrupted me 8o}
The Harry Potter Series is amazg  As a teacher I try to keeep up wh children's l  this assignment (self imposed) has been a pleasure As I  entered the book ste to purchase the lastest book I encountered a parent   child engrossed  the novel  I asked the child (about 10 years old)  what she thought so far  she smiled  told me that  was excellent  Of course I rushed to the counter f my reserved copy I have read each  of the four stallments  have found each one better than the next  This book is a page-turner It is well plotted engrossg  mesmerizg  (thk L'Engle Lewis) What a wonderful gt to children's lerature (  to l teachers everywhere) The plot settg characters  conflict  become real to the lucky readers  I f one can't wa f the next  stallment
Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire is the best book I have ever read It is much better than any of the other 3 Harry Potter books If you liked   loved the others than you will also love this one Buy  now  you  haven't
Once aga JK Rowlg has shown her wonderful imagation  excellent wrg  this 4th stallment of the Harry Potter books  Her character  development tricate plot les comedy fictional creativy   true-to-le personalies all combe to fm an credibly satisfyg  read  Every book impresses me me  In Goblet of Fire I could not put   down particulary  the last quarter  This is a sign of a great wrer   all of her books have held my attention until the very end  In fact  sometimes I guiltily caught myself skimmg future pages because I so  wanted to fd out what happens  But I restraed myself  contued to  read  I was not disappoted!  Her build-up to the climax  conclusion  of Goblet of Fire was the best yet!  These books are not just f kids  They are an credibly satisfyg read f adults as well  I highly  recommend you read this book!
The begng  the endg of this book were suspenseful excg purposeful  There is a beautul development through these books wh  each one becomg me adult  complex  The characters are growg up   learng to deal not only wh each other but wh a magical wld that  is far from a Disney fairy taleWhat then justied the long wasteful   unnecessary chapters on the Triwizard Tournament?  Hundreds of pages  about a contest that essentially takes place on three specic days  And  we are expected to believe that two other heads of magical schools would  leave their own schools f an entire school year just to s at Hogwarts  wag f the contest days?  And what did the extra students those not  selected f the tournament do all year?  And most imptantly why didn't  the Tra simply give Harry a ptkey at the begng?  What on earth  was the pot of wag until the end of the tournament?  There was no  pot except to deliver a longer bookJK Rowlg should be very proud  of herself f this wk overall  s place  the Harry Potter  universe but she should be ashamed at the poly thought out   nonsensical plot device of the Triwizard Tournament
The futh stallment of Harry Potter is unfgetable  I was a b discouraged though that the book was left hangg at the end  All  all  the book was que an terestg change from the other 3  Though I  equally enjoyed those too  JK Rowlg contues to amaze us wh her  creativy  astoundg imagation
This Harry Potter book out does the other three New characters new suations me magic  even- death The book's endg leaves you  wag impatiently f book #5 I can't wa!
I was fascated wh the previous 3 volumes of Harry Potter AT the same time I couldn't help doubtg how dear Rowlg contues to wre on this  Harry Potter series I thought she had wrten out all best part of the  fantastic sty of the growg up magical boy &quotHarry Potter&quot He  has overcome sad memy of his parents' death  he has got everythg he  needs wealth family  friends Now he's all right  every way  I  was wrong however  He always has dark shadow on his back Voldemt   's time to face   Rowlg is clever  Her wrg is well planned  Now I know the reason why she named the last chapter of this book &quotThe  Begng&quot  Yes she's right  In this volume she tells we are on  the turng pot of the long long sty which I know tells self a new  begng of HIS adventure
This was a great book period I thk some of the chapters wernt needed this book told a lot me about the characters The book is long but s so  good  goes really fast I recommend this to ANYBODY So read  now
What can I say?  I am also an adult fan  My kids got me hooked! I loved all three previous books  I love this one as well  I thk this one is  aimed at older kids probably 9  up  My advice is f parents to read   first to see   fs their child's matury level  This book is  defely dferent than the others  many ways  It is a ltle darker   is the begng to a bigger sty  We can start to see the evilness  that everyone lived wh when Voldemt  his followers were takg over  I do not want to give any of the sty away so I am a ltle vague  Ms  Rowlg really shows what a carg honable person Harry is  Harry is a  very good example f our children  one of my new heroes!  This book  stayed  my md f a few day after I fished readg  It was a great  book I tried to read  slowly to sav the sty  However I could not  resist  fished  too fast!  As far as I am concerned  could have  been 2734 pages  I would still be longg f me  Ms Rowlg can  wre a sty like no other auth can at least  my opion  She is  truly an artist!  I cannot wa until the next!  BRAVO JO ROWLING!
I have enjoyed the entire Harry Potter series but I must saythat I was most impressed wh Harry Potter  the goblet of Fire I have now gotten almost all of my family readg Harry Potter  Me  the rest of my family have at least read the first book Wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire generatg so much excement amongst me  my friends I rushed through readg  the first time  4 days! My mom was wag to read   didn't want to know any details  It was hard not to tell of the excg details  I won't do that now []  I am a fervent fan of J K Rowlg  the Harry Potter series  am lookg fward to the next stallment of Harry Potter
I loved all 4 of these books The "Goblet of Fire" is great maybe even the BEST of the Harry Potter books Like all the books The Goblet of Fire  is about growg  learng -  is about discoverg your own powers   talents But  is especially about how to be human how to develop to a  better human beg how to enhance your personal character While  is  temptg to always strive to w at others expense The Goblet of Fire  teaches people of all ages also the virtue of teamwk of true friendship   of overcomg challenges  discoverg your ner greatness It is a  book about PERSONAL GROWTH   SELF-DISCOVERY!As usual Harry discovers  the secrets  acts heroically Lots of twists  turns  big  surprises You MUST read this book!  I know  is longer than the other 3  books - BUT IT IS WORTH IT!  This is a book f the ages - a must read f  people of all ages (I confess I am an adult -  I loved )ANOTHER  BOOK I highly recommend is: "Wkg on Yourself Doesn't Wk" by Ariel  &amp Shya Kane This book is the most simple  yet magical  enjoyable  book I have ever read about Self-Discovery It is not a novel but  is  about the Prciples that allow you to easily discover how to contue to  grow  discover your own greatness whether young  old It helps you to  have your le be an ongog learng process  self-discovery process  It is also about becomg your true selfas one of the auths has said   is about learng how to BECOME YOUR OWN PERSONAL HERO It is really a  Practical Guide to havg a Magical Le!  If you have been feelg a b  like a "Muggle" lately - READ both "Wkg On Yourself Doesn't Wk"   "The Goblet of Fire"  discover how to re-claim the MAGIC  your le!
After readg the first 3 books I was really lookg fward to readg the fourth because the first 3 were so good  I wouldn't call #4 better  than the others because they were all excellent but  sure was excg  to read  I defely recommend Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire to  anyone but under one condion: nothg will make sense  you start wh  book 4  book 3  even book 2  You have to read them  der!  Trust  me  will make f much me enjoyable readgHave a great time  readg this excellent book!
Stunng  loved  especially the end  how new characters were troduced Can't wa f the next
JK Rowlg is a genius!  First of all let me say thank you to this very talented  creative lady  I have enjoyed all the Harry Potter books from  the begng  am pleased to see the tegry  qualy of the series  mataed so wellOne always hopes that a sequel will bear out the  reputation that the igal book has carved f self  Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire doesn't just mata the stard  raises the bar  One of the thgs about this series that I enjoy so much is that the agg  of the characters is hled realistically   good lerary style  Harry's fourteen now  the social/le problems he's encounterg are  pretty much the nm f any adolescent Well an adolescent wizard anyway  I urge all fans of the series to read Goblet of Fire  As f myself all I  want to be is the next Profess of Muggle Studies at Hogwart's!  Kudos Ms  Rowlg keep up the great wk!
I loved !  Best of all of the books yet--not to mentionlongest!  I'm really addicted to all the Harry Potter books--I fished this one  just hours believe   not  I mean wow I'm a member of all these Harry Potter fan ses  a ton of the Interactive Hogwarts!  Anyway  JK's books keep gettg longer I thk I'll be  heaven!  Then when the 7th one's done I'll die of dispair (maybe)  Well trust me Harry Potter is great--  you've never read  then start now!  This book deffetly lives up to the reputation set by the first three even though the begg is a ltle dferent  Just read !  Read all of them!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!

So take the adventure along wh Harry as he enters his fourth year of  magic!
 st of hs you right here you know where rowlg just knows what she's dog now i can't say that potter has reached me on any extremely  deep emotional  metaphysical level wh some startlg revelation about  the md  human nature but 's just escapism at 's purest cleanest  best  rocks i care about the characters are familiar wh them  believe  them  yet on a whole 's so light that i can happily read  the book  set  down whout nightmares that st of carefree  sty-tellg i haven't found anywhere else so that's that love these  books!
This book I feel is defely a wthy sequel to the first three The characters contue to develop Harry's new experiences (the Quiddch  Wld Cup f example) pique our terest  new  better plot twists  emerge However those who have not yet read this book should be warned  that  is not like the others This one is darker as the auth has  warned us  murder becomes a distct theme  very real possibily  f the characters  f this reason may be a ltle advanced f the  youngest readers I would like to stress though that  is still not  satanic (as some would have you believe) on the contrary strong messages  of trust  friendship are conveyed-- conveyed not preached there's a  dference--  the characters apparently observe Christian holidaysThe most unbelievable thg about this series is the complexy of the  plots Durg the seven-hour period I spent whout food sleep  human  contact so as to get through the whole thg (I just couldn't put  down)  I stopped once  a while to wonder just how the auth could possibly have  come up wh some of this stuff Let's just hope she saved enough f the  next three booksOh  one me thg: does anyone else suspect  Hagrid has an American accent?
JK's latest book is great  I enjoyed the new characters  the new sights to Harry's past  I wish she'd fally get him away from his  muggle relatives the Dursley's My children have devoured each one of Ms  Rowlg's books  I appreciate havg a series out that my children  actually make excuses to readThanks aga f a fun sty  how long  are we gog to have to wa f book five?
I first read about Harry Potter  a review made by (I thk) the Time Magaze wonderg what the hype was all about  When I fished the  article I got even me terested about Harry  so I bought a paper  back copy of the first book thkg at the same time that that was a  brilliant marketg strategy (spendg I thk 4 pages on the review)  To  my surprise I was really taken aback by the eloquent stytellg that Ms  JK Rowlg has troduced me to I was hooked from page 1 of the first  book to the last pages of the fourth  I had my 9 year old (at the time)  daughter Kathlene read the book  she too was enthralled by    so I shared books 2  3 wh her  we couldn't wa f book 4 to be  published  When I bought book 4 my daughter  I alternately read    shared the excement of the adventures of our new pal Harry Potter  takg precautions not to overread lest one of us would be left on a steep  clfhanger  But I couldn't help  so I went  fished book 4 ahead  of my daughter though I was a b anxious that there will be no me Harry  Potter magic left f the days ahead until next year  book 5 I could  hardly wa  Aga  My daughter beg a ltle b me conservative  enjoyg every detail of Harry's adventures fished the book 3 me days   so after I didHarry Potter books deserve 5 stars f takg us all  to a fun adventure  the magical wld  Hurray to Ms JK  Rowlgs!Ramon
All of the 'Harry Potter' books have been thoughly pleasg but I have to say that this one goes far beyond the rest  The other books seemed to  end to soon this book over 700 pages is enough to please even the best  of readers  I recommend this books f readers of all ages
This is suposed to be classic fantasy?  I found hardly anythg imagative  the book at all  Read somethg that is imagative  is  well wrten  Somethg like Robert Jdan's Wheel of Time series  CS  Lewis JRR Tolkien  All of those men have created entirely new wlds   they are much me imagative Blazg_Call@hotmailcom
This is by far the greatest of the four books The way the auth keep you  suspense from page to page The way she keep the sty  high   tense action around each coner Harry becomg me powerful  at the  same time wiser  the wizerdg wld around him And his Quiddch skills  just blow you away  readg about the triwizard cup was really great  I really love this book  i recomend this book to anyone who hasnt read   peace out JESS!
Despe the apprehension endured by many surroundg the release of this the eagerly awaed fourth book  the Harry Potter series Rowlgs  abily to susta the suberbly consistent nature of the series can not be  questioned I was not suprised to see that Rowlg had this time  surpassed herself The Goblet of fire is charmg funny  telligent  The Quiddch wld cup  deed the game of Quiddch self is a stroke  of genius as is the school of Hogwarts The real beauty of the book  however lies  the ease wh which the sty flows the humour of all the  characters most notably the Weasley tws (THANK GOD FOR FRED AND  GEORGE!) the warmth of Dumblede  Hagrid  the bravery of Harry  Ron Hermione  even Neville all tertwe wh a well crafted sty to  be enjoyed by both wizards  muggles (sry children  adults)
I've read every harry potter book  thk they get better each timeThe suspense  this book is awesome as new characters create new adventures  f Harry Ron  Hermione  JR Rowlg's emagation that was put to  this book was credible
OK so you've been holdg out f a long time 3 books have been published  you resisted - smugly - the urge to sneak out  buy one of  these kids books You looked wh py from behd your copy of Beowoulf at  your fellow communters as they quickly turned the pages of the Potter  legendsI too was one of the cynics I felt I should be spendg all my  free time readg wthy heavy booksBut now I can say  My name is  Matt  I am a Harry Potter fanAfter just only 4  5 pages my  hardened adult resistance was broken down I began to become transfmed by  the rich text -  you are an adult  really does take you back to all  those amazg feelgs you had as a child - Wonder  Fun Curiousy Warm  affectionRead this book rediscover some of the best parts of your  past  tomrow you'll live a better le
Wh a ltle help from Harry Hermione Ron  (of course) JK Rowlg's Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire breaks every recd  sight   has quickly become a lerary phenomon The highly anticipate book 4  from talented  wimsical JK Rowlg actually manages to live up to the  all the buzzThe 700+ page sty centers around the Triwizard Tournement  an event that hasent taken place f years at the Hogwarts school of  Wchcraft As one may expect Harry ends up as one of the Triwzards  competg f the gold The Triwzard tournamentwhich encperates the  usial goblens monsters  deamons makes f a highly enjoyable   terestg sty
I am pretty much obsessed wh this series No I don't have children n am I a child myself But JK Rowlg has certaly wrten a series that  brg me back to my childhood  the types of books I loved to read then  Goblet is the darkest yet  the series  I suspect thgs will only  get me tense from here on  I am anxious to see where Book 5 goes  from here
In my opion this is the best Harry Potter book  the series The endgs  books 1  2 were kd of rushed The endg  book 3 had  Harry facg dferent kds of challenges   was me creative but   was kd of like a bridge to Goblet Of Fire Goblet of Fire has a kd  of endg you might be wag f after readg the other books but   you can guess all the details of how thgs play out you should give  yourself a lot of cred Plus you are really gettg to the meat of the  series Your imagation is fed wh addional terestg characters   creatures  book 4 Harry Potter And The Goblet of fire contas the  funniest scene  the whole series near the begng The darkest moments   book 4 are me graphic  tense than befe but much of the book is  not that way And you will be cheerg f the good guys at two very  satisfyg moments at the conclusion of the book Let's just say that  people who deserve bad thgs happeng to them get theirs One thg that  makes Rowlg's books so good is how fantasy is mixed wh realy  Characters have very human emotions  suations even though they have  magic powers So therefe 's still not a bl perfect wld but 's  certaly me fun than ours Rowlg uses creatures  ems found   other lerature but she melds them together  her own way I advise  readg the other three books first (the second is my least fave but  's still solid Harry Potter)  enjoy! There is some explanation but  the auth does not go to enough detail to cover such a big  volved  book These books are not just f people who are not adults The wrg  is not hard wrg but  may have to be explaed f young kids JK  Rowlg tells her sty  a way that doesn't seem too immature f older  readers But  retas the kd of action-packed entertament value that  children like There are a lot of glimpses of the adult wld Plus anyone  can use the escapism  Harry Potter books Goblet of Fire has two good  lessons  : cooperation wh others  fightg discrimation It's a  great book!use the escapism  Harry Potter books Goblet of Fire has two good  lessons  : cooperation wh others  fightg discrimation It's a  great book!
This was my first Harry Potter book  I have to adm that although I'm not a teenager anyme I really enjoyed this book I decided to get the  latest one to see what all the excement was about Now that I've read   I can see why everybody is ravg about these books They're fun f  everyone from 8 to 80!
Readg the four books  hopefully beg able to read the last three I have had a wonderful experience  Sad but true good book collections do not  come very often  Not only are the Harry Potter books great when you read  them you get to your own wld  you can realate to them even  you  don't have a scar on your head  magic powers I would recommend this  book to the young  the old  I hope that the great auth JK Rowlg  contues wrg extrodary books like Harry Potter  she can bet I  will be the first  le to get my copy
I have throughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series  am wag on the edge of my seat f the 5th year to come out  A delightful adventure to  wizards  homewk Jim Henson meets Monty Python  the Holy Grail  Each one captures the imagation  holds the reader spellbound until the  last page  My hat off to Mrs Rowlg  I cannot wa to see what's   ste f Harry next
I was a skeptic f a long time about the Harry Potter phenomenon  I tried readg &quotPhilosopher's Stone&quot (Scerer's Stone to all  numbskull Americans) about three times but never got beyond the first two  chapters  Fally at my nephew's urgg I read everythg through  &quotAzkaban&quot I was hooked  And now wh this terric fourth  book JK Rowlg has made a believer out of me the person who thought no  one else could touch the wks of JRR Tolkien E Nesb Susan Cooper   Edward Eager  But she's up there wh the masters now!  &quotGoblet&quot  has all the requise passion suspense thrills  wonder of the best of  fantasy magic  mystery books  But as  all the fe books that have  come befe this series (The Ld of the Rgs The Dark Is Risg  sequence etc) the ma character would be nothg whout the help  fahfulness  bravery of his friends As much as I love Harry I also  love Ron Hermione Hagrid Dumblede Sirius the Weasleys   this  last book po doomed Diggy  I alternately b my nails screamed out  loud  cried through the last 100 pages  I'm spent  Thank you Ms  Rowlg -- you've made my summer
I really don't know what I thk about this book  I didn't like  as much as book three my fave of the Harry Potter books  I didn't  like  as much as book one my second fave  I thk that book four   book two are tied f third  It is pretty well-wrten as all of  Rowlgs books seem to be  I liked the chapters that the first   second tasks hold  I like the chapter Padfoot Returnes but I can  freely say that I did not like the first chapter one ltle b  I can say  that the book deserves the three stars given to  one each  seemes f  the three chapters that I liked well  Some other chapters are good too
I very much enjoyed the first three Harry Potter books  The third was the best followed by the first  then the second  The fourth book was a  total disappotment  It was long  potless I would rather wa a few  years f a good book then to have a huge monstrosy like the goblet of  fire put out to make money  I am lookg fward to the fth book   hope  is me like the first  third
This book is the best book of all of the harry's easily because  doesnt only have action any mystery  also has the problems of a 14 year old boy who is fced to cruise f chicksThis book is a ltle b longer than  the rest but that isnt a problem becausse  is so truigg that u read   fast  752 pages  I read   2 days  could have fished    1 This book is the coolest book the end was so good i was  tears when   endedPlease read this cause  will be a talkg pot f the rest of  your leSO BUY ITNNNOOWWW!
I read the book  less than two days I couldn't put  down I am 11  loved  sooooooo much  I made my mother read   She had the same  problem  She couldn't put  down untill  was fished  MY family is a  very christian family  we found  okay f christians as well  It  shows how good ws over evil  Note to JK Rowlg Wre me!  You  rule!  I can't wa f the next book!  Hurry  wre  soon!
As the mother of four children  I have fallen  love wh these books  These books are not just about a magical wld  which Harry Potter goes  to school they are magic themselves because my 11 year old that hated to  read was given one as a birthday present from his stepfather  he  discovered the joy of readg!   (Thank you JK Rawlg)  We own two  complete sets of these books at our house  reread them often my kids  would rather reread a Harry Potter book than watch TV  Book four is  great A ltle surprisg  yes I cried when the one character died  Here at our house we are wag  countg down until number five will  be released!
This 4th book is wonderful!  It has a lot of pages (700+) but  is wth every page every chapter!  There are new characters new animals (Hagrid  keeps the students hoppg!)  there's still Harry Ron  HermioneIf you love a good mystery adventure friendship novel then by all  means rush out  buy this book :)  You'll thank yourself later!
The fourth book  the series is clearly Rowlg's best  (whew!) longest book yet!  Although I fished  wh 11 hours the book was no  less trigug n ensnarlg f me than any of the other Harry Potter  fans scattered around ( should I say `crammed to') the wld  The book  clearly cludes a large number of real-le references rangg from  large-scale similaries such as polical scals  obstate polical  figures to book tles  the Hogwarts library: Where There's a W  There's a Way Men Who Love Dragons Too Much  Powers You Never Knew You  Had  What to do Wh Them Now That You've Wised Up  The new Defense  Agast the Dark Arts teacher is my personal fave so far  Not as  ethical as Lup n as bombastic  contrived as Lockhart  dferent  aga from the deceful  two-faced (que lerally) Quirrell he  follows the long le of DATDA teachers befe him  lasts only a sgle  year  (I wonder  the Daily Prophet simply assumes that  must run the  job offer aga each summer! )  Some delightful new characters clude the  pryg fmation flatg Ra Skeeter the excgly  dferent-than-expected Bill  Charlie Weasley  the annoyg ltle  owl that Ron received at the end of Harry Potter III now named Pidwidgeon  Old fans will be delighted to discover that Percy Weasley now wkg f  the Mistry hasn't changed a b  curious to see who the new  Gryffd Quiddch capta is now that Wood has gone (have we got a  surprise f you here! )  Some new me adult aspects appear as Harry  Ron  Hermoe must fd dates f the Yule Ball  Ron becomes me  sensive about his family's fancial suation   (just a b) me  jealous of Harry  Hermoe lets less  less of Malfoy's harsh wds  bother her Subtle strgs of clues throughout the book entwe at the end  culmatg  an entrancg clfhanger f readers  Knowg Rowlg  we'll have to wa que a while to fd out the rest of the sty que a while to fd out the rest of the sty
Hey Everybody  If you haven't read a Harry Potter book yet  You don't even know what your missg!  I am 16  Yes you might say a ltle old f  kids books  But these are not any dary kids books  It is like a kid  book on the outside but not on the side  Even my mom says she wants to  read them  I recomend these books f anybody under the sun! Just buy them  now  Save them f your kids  grkids  I am sure these are gog to  be classics!
I found this book one of the most well-wrten children's books ever I was spellbound by the fast-paced twists  turns of the plot I have read  all 4 books  the series  I thk this one is my fave even though  every one is que remarkable  The 5th is sure to be a h I can't wa!  Keep  up Ms Rowlg!
Kudos to Ms Rowlg f makg the best Harry Potter book the goblet of fire has an amazg amount of actionhum ect the pris of azkaban  used to be my fave book until i read this one! the book is unpredictible   the endg is surprisg but i won't give any thg else away  you  haven't read the fth book yet then jo the bwagon  see what i'm  talkg about! ~ 5 stars isn't nearly enough compared to what   deserves!
I fished _Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_ last night  Wow  I really do thk that  is the best of the bunch primarily because   tells a much me complex sty that is still wrapped up  the end  The  book is longer because there are me twists  maj events than  the  previous volumes  But Rowlg brgs all of the events together to a  logical  complete conclusion  All questions are answered  And as she  stated  terviews as he goal she has enabled Harry to make the  transion from boyhood to adulthood  The next books are really gog to  be somethgI do wonder how kids ( parents) are respondg to the  text  It gets dramatic ( spoilers will follow here)  It's always been  tense because Harry has always been an phan whose parents were  murdered  But this one is much me tense  A fellow student dies  Evil  becomes a much stronger  me recognizable fce  I am remded of the  end of _The Empire Strikes Back_ because evil has risen   appears that   will triumph  Sure we know that the last book will end wh Harry's  triumph but the series has taken a dark turn  No longer are Malfoy  Crabbe  Goyle merely Harry's school rivals They are the sons of death  eaters  Most likely they want Harry dead  they just might try to kill  him  later books so that they will be seen as strong  their  &quotLd's&quot eyesI don't mean f my comments on the book's  tensy to sound like a cricism  any way because I loved   The  book could be a great catalyst f discussion  juni high schools But  I'm not sure what would happen  's read  kdergartens as the earlier  books were As a kid this book would have scared me  Though as an adult  I love The only only only thg I would have changed would have  been f Harry to have said somethg to Neville at the end not to let him  know that Harry knows what happened to his parents  But he should have  said goodbye  told Neville to send him an owl over the summer  just  made some ty b of connection wh him  This is certaly a m  pot I'm sure Neville will take on a greater role  later books  I  certaly look at hischaracter dferently nowgoodbye  told Neville to send him an owl over the summer  just  made some ty b of connection wh him  This is certaly a m  pot I'm sure Neville will take on a greater role  later books  I  certaly look at hischaracter dferently now
I have read all of the Harry Potter books  I must say they are brilliant  JK Rowlg doesn't talk down to us just because we are young  She wres  the same spir as CS Lewis  JRR Tolkien (all the  best fantasy wrers have tials f names)  Many people believe that   is too serious too soon The fact that there is death  other thgs  makes  me real  I know  real le that isn't an evil wizard  Voldemt but le doesn't rap up  a neat ltle package  The book  addresses issues like bigotry  other social dferencs that adults thk  are eher beyond our comprehension  that they are just scared of the  subjects themselves  This book despe the fact that  is thick is very  terestg  It holds s own even wh the thner books  the series  Just because  is thick doesn't mean 's bg  It is easy to read  because of the images that are created  your md  It fascates us  because  is a wld wh ours that we know nothg about  wish we  could be apart of  I'm not sayg that  makes one want to jo the  occult  It doesn't  It makes you want to read me fantasy (the greatest  type of book there is)  If someone does want to jo the occult  is not  the book's fault  It is that persons  One of the better qualies of  the books is the fact that there are underlyg messages  The first book  says that love will always be wh us  the second says that our choices  makes us who we are me than our abilies  The fourth says that  is  not what we are bn but what we grow up to be  These messages are  imptant to children of all ages considerg the fact that many adults  have not learned those lessons themselves
I am the same age as Harry I don't know what to say about this book It's the best book I ever read Everybody should read  at least once It's the  longest  the best of all the Harry Potter books The sty is better  wh lots of surprises to keep  terestg This is not only a  children's book adults would also enjoy  I know this review isn't very  good but please buy the book You won't regret 
I started readg the Harry Potter books because I heard on the news that certa Christian groups were givg them an unfaviable review  Out of  curiosy  beg a Christian myself I felt  unfair to accept others  view of these books whout knowg myself the context of them  I  purchased all four of them  I have found them very enjoyable very  trigug   a way teach us how to conduct ourselves properly  very  confrontational suations  I fd them thoughly delightful  hated  every time I had to put a book down  I personally don't see anythg wrong  wh these books  recommend them f very pleasurable readg  I'm  lookg fward to the next one  also to the movie  they actually make  
This book entranced me  I couldn't put  down  You get transplanted to Harry's wld  you share everythg he feels  Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire as well as the other Harry Potter books are by far the  most enjoyable read I've ever had  READ THIS BOOK you will be very glad  you did
This book was defetly the best of the series by far  You get to the book very quickly  Unlike book 3 this book does not drag  picks up  wh the first 100 pages This book is a must read f people of all  ages  I thk that this book helped me to relax  enjoy myself   helped to put some sany back to my head  I can't wa f the next  book to come out
The first time I touched this book I felt that i can't fish  Image readg a book of 700+ pages I had never read a book me than 250 pages But when I read the first chapter I didn't want to put  down Sce then  I was so keen to read the book after school It is a spectacular amazg   a woderful wk of art It's wth buyg even  the price doubles
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire made me nearly weep wh joy at 's immense number of pages (over 700 pgs) I read the other three  was  immediately hooked wh the begng of the first: Harry Potter  the  Scerer's Stone  I must adm I was overjoyed at the number of pages but  because I am a fast reader I was done  about a day wh  which left  me yearng pafully f the fth stallment which is due  July of  2001 I have along time to wa but awa impatiently my only hope is  that as the series goes on the books will get thicker  JK Rowlg  happens to read this review I imple her to make the fth book over  1000 pages long so that we can read f what may seem like an eterny  JK Rowlg is a genius  her own sense  I hope that she contues to  hold us spellbound by this young wizard Harry Potter
This was every b as good as the first three  I deduct one star due to the wds I had to ed out when readg to my seven year old  They are  really not necessary  I am sure that someone as bright  creative as JK  Rowlg can do better
Though I've suspected the Harry Potter series was really f adults The Goblet of Fire convced me!  It held my attention  allowed me moments  of melancholy of childhooh fantasies  I do thk that the mere size may be  prohibive to some young readers  If they will st true  put up wh  the weight of the book they will fd great pleasure  adventure as  &quotYou Know Who&quot returns to kill Harry  He has an adventure on  every page!
This book ties f the best wk of fiction I have ever read wh Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card  The Harry Potter books are wonderfully fancul   (at times) genuely scary  Ender's Game  Goblet of Fire share  similar themes - they each show a child  new  strange surroundgs  fced to do the impossible  excellg  unbelievable ways  Also  they're both the kd of books that I can't help but read  one stg  ( try anyway - at 734 pages Goblet of Fire is a b long f one  stg)  The new characters are wonderful  impressive  the book  will keep you guessg till the very end  Can't wa f book 5!
Hello! I thk the Harry Potter books 1-4 so far are fabulous! It amazes me how could JK Rowlg can use her imagation!

Me  me!
Most people  this day  age have seen read  at least HEARD of Harry Potter the wizard Beg so popular here I wish the same went f  him  the wizard wld wh the Slythers I'll tell you me about the  book nextNow  this book Harry's summer vacation starts out like  usual spendg 3/4 of vacation wh the Dursley's  the rest wh the  Weasley's This summer Harry gets a chance to go to the Quiddch Wld  Cup All starts out ok  all wries are gone f the day until that  night The Death Eaters have come out of hidg  the Dark Mark is   the skyWhen Harry Hermione  Ron return to school the learn about  the Triwizard Tournament Of course Harry gets picked to be  the  tournament as well as 3 other people 2 beg from OTHER schools! Here   gets very terestg Harry  the others must complete three dangerous  tasks to see who will be the championDoes Voldemt return f  Harry?  Will someone die? Who ws the Quiddch Wld Cup? What is Mr  Crouch's big secret?  I won't go to detail so to fd out me read the  book!  It'll keep you busy f hours  hours! Trust me!
I've noticed that some of you don't like this book beg longerbut f methis is terric breaks my heart every time the sty is over  i fished the first one  five hours! This one took me longer but i  wish  could go on fever JK congratualations you have wrten  sties that had kids that hate readgreadg! i've read the first  three about five times  the fth about three timeshurry up  wre  the fth! but don't be to rushed!  I love you!
The Harry Potter series is the best book series  the wldI enjoyed all four I am so surprised JK Rowlg has such an imagation The first book was wonderful It showed true courage  bravery from a boy of 11 who  didn't even know how to use magic that well growg up wh  Muggles(Anti-magic begs) The second book shows true mystery It was so  hard f me to put this one down because I kept wantg to fd out the  what would would happen nextThe third Harry Potter book is a true tale It  shows complete mystery adventure  suspense I'd say this one ends   the begng of the Harry Potter Book 4 wh the reader meetg Peter  Petigrew If I had to choose  between the movie series Scream  Harry Potter I'd choose Harry Potter  No book movie  cd is better than the Harry Potter series
I loved all of the other Harry Potter books  this one was defely wth the wa  I enjoyed every second I read  had a very terestg   very creative plot   was very well wrten keepg me terested   wantg to read  These books are f everyone from small children to  old people I thk everyone can enjoy them as much as I did  I am very  exced about the next book  the books after that!
I'm 17years old  I spent the whole night readg  When I fally fished readg  well  It was deed fun but the plot is always  neary the same&quotHarry is sendg a hrible time wh the Dursleys   someone always rescuses him he goes to school where Malfoy  Snape  make him miserable gets himself voled  somethg that never happens to  other students runs to Voldermt  one of his followers  escapes  narrowly wh a wound  two   becomes a hero&quotIsn't  about  time f a unpredictable plot to come out? Honestly the same thg every  time usg  4 times is just too much
Harry Potter #4 is the best book so far This was what I least expected First there is a set tournament that the whole school watches Not sneakg  down to meet Fluffy the three headed dog  gog up to the Shriekg  Shack to see Sirius Black Not that  falls sht of the other books I'd  say  exceeds them by a lot There is still all the ties that twist  together  the end which I thk JK Rowlg has a talent f This far  exceeds the Hobb  the Redwall series  Another reviewer said that  they could not concentrate on the book  at times  was bg In the  begng the gog is a ltle slow  but  all has to do wh the ties  If you don't want to read the begng the book is not as good  the end  The thg that makes this  the other books so popular is that people  can identy wh them that's why the appeal to the wide range of ages We  have all had the big tests The unfairness that we can't control the  risk takg thats  us too The book's descriptions are que good you  feel like you're there wh Harry battlg wh Profeser Quirrel  eatg  the squishy  wmy gillyweed  Book 4  However all the books are a  ltle sexist There are only Two women professers Trelawnry   McGonagall Trelawnry is shown to be basically a fake McGonagall is  Super  strict  never lets  anythg go by her There are no woman characters  that are charmg like professer Lup Hermione is also followg the  McGonagall way very strict Although Hermione has been lettg up on the  strictness through each book s still there  This is defately one  of the best books I'v read  even though  costs a ltle me you  should get   Its me than seven hundred hundred pages of one of the  best book ever
I recently picked up the first book  the Harry Potter series at the Raleigh-Durham airpt  Nth Carola f 7 dollars(paperback) figurg  I would give  a chance  It was recommended to me by my Hons English  teacher who is  her late 60's  was readg the book  class while we  were wkg  So I climbed aboard my 90 mute flight to Orlo   settled down f some nice readg  I read over 200 pages  those 90  mutes of one of the best books I have ever opened  I quickly fished  that book  immediately went out  bought the other three  fished  each of those  about 24 hours each  The Goblet of Fire however has  been my fave so far  Harry's adventures  the TriWizard Tournament  kept my eyes glued to the pages  I remember lookg up  thkg  &quotWowI've just read 500 pages&quot  Basically what I'm tryg to  say is that this is not just a kid's book  is a book f anyone who has  imagation would like a good laugh likes surprise endgs likes fantasy  books  just someone who likes to read  The Goblet of Fire is a book  that can be enjoyed by everyone  So go pick up this newest Harry Potter  book   you haven't read any of them start at the begng  wk  your way up  I guarantee you will fd yourself absbed as I  others  have been  tales of Quiddch Animagi  of course Harry Potter  himself
The best of the four books  that is sayg a lot as the first three were excellent This book is substantially longer than the first three so  the plot is a ltle fullerThe books are great to read to your kids  Even younger kids (age 5+) will underst the sty  be enthralled  Share the readg wh your older kids  make  a family time Even  adults will fd the sty mesmerizgRowlg does a great job of  keepg the sty movg keepg your attention focused  makg a book  come alive If you have a reluctant reader  your home these may be the  books that turn them around It was JRR Tolke f me but Harry Potter  may be this generation's Hobb
I HAVE READ ALL 4 OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS AND IT HAS BECOME SOMEWHAT OF AN OBSESSION FOR ME  I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED READING BUT HARRY POTTER HAS  CAST A SPELL ON ME  ONE AFTER ANOTHER I READ THE FIRST THREE AND SAT ON  THE EDGE OF MY SEAT UNTIL THE FOURTH ONE CAME OUT (OF COURSE I KNEW THE  DATE AND WHERE TO GO TO GET IT)  HAVING FINISHED THE FOURTH JUST THIS  AFTERNOON I CAN TELL YOU AS IT IS STILL FRESH IN MY MIND THIS IS THE BEST  BOOK I HAVE READ YET  NOT ONLY BY ROWLING BUT BY ANY AUTHOR ANYWHERE  RIVOTING AS WELL AS REFRESHING THIS BOOK COULD MAKE KIDS AND ADULTS ALIKE  JUST SMILE  I LAUGHED I CRIED I FELT LIKE I WAS INSIDE OF IT JUST  ANOTHER FRIEND OF HARRY'S  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE FIFTH BOOK AND I AM  ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE MOVIE!
I'm 15  I read the Harry Potter series They are the greatest books I have ever read  my le  let me tell you somethg I have read a lot  of books Its so hard to put these down You have to read them from cover  to cover  one stg Thats how good they are JK Rowlg is a complete  genious No one can argue wh that The way she wres these books is  absolutely amazg At the end of the book you are so suprised at what  happens you don't expect  at all But  disturbs me to see 50 year-old  crics ratg this as books that lead young children to the occult ER!  Probably not These books are from our time they aren't somethg they had  50 years ago These sties tell how  is growg up as kids these days  These books don't tell what girls should be  how they should grow up   tell the guys what they have to do  how they should do  It is  spirg SO s completely unfair that these books get bad reviews by  cranky old crics who don't underst what these books are all about
I thought this book was the best  the series so far is a good thriller Good f all agesVery enjoyable
I am a 30-year old professional a b young at heart (I happen to be  the toy dustry) I dived to the 4th book wh great expectation after  the readg the first 3  must adm to be somewhat disappotedThe  1st half of the book is spent buildg up background fo  arrivg at  the conclusion of the last 150 pages  Much of the hum found  books 1  to 3 is missg here which is especially imptant when Rowlg is tryg  to drown the reader  the bg 3 to 4 hundred pagesAnother pot I  also found to be very annoyg is Harry  Ron's speech which began to  change gradually  book 3  is now  full fce  book 4  Apparently  Rowlg wanted to make  sound &quotcolloquial&quot  fmal  consequently a lot of &quotyeah&quot &quotI dunno&quot etc  I guess  you could say that the prose overall is actually a ltle sloppy at  timesThis book is heavy  terms of both weight  ambience but light   entertament
If you liked the first three books you'll like this one There's even me to enjoy here 734 pages' wth! Old characters return: the Weasleys  Albus Dumblede Hermione Hagrid the dreadful Dursleys Draco Malfoy et  al And you'll meet new ones such as Ra Skeeter Mad-Eye Moody Wky  the house-elf  Vict Krum This is very good fantasy the st that  makes you see the magic  everyday le I've noticed that me  me  grown-ups are readg this series which is defely not f children  only While you're wag f Harry Potter 5 you might enjoy readg  fantasies by two outstg Brish auths Diana Wynne Jones  Eva  Ibbotson (look f the latter's ghost books  UK edions)
Rowlg has done  aga! People all around the wld waed f July 8th to deliver Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Now s here  we can't  get enough! Aga Rowlg shes through wh a vivid imagation sense  of emotion  the spir only few others have If Harry Potter were a  drug I'd be  rehab (just kiddg!) I fished  twice  three days  Crazed?maybe But how long does the wld have to wa f a fth?
I am 19 years old  When I first heard about the Harry Potter hype I thought  was just another stupid kid's series like the Goosebumps books  of a few years ago  But when &quotGoblet of Fire&quot came out  I  saw so many kids gog crazy over   the bookstes I decided to fd  out why the series was so popular  Now I'm hookedThis book is the best  of the series so far  Rowlg gets me volved  character development  so the reader begs to really know Harry Hermione Ron  everyone else  at Hogwarts  I loved how Rowlg took the sty to a whole new level (I  won't spoil  f you!)  how emotional thgs got near the end  I  don't know what else to say about this book - 's just credible  One  of the best parts:  even though this is a children's book Rowlg doesn't  water thgs down  I like that
When every there is a series where  has a preset amount of books   countues on  on like a comic books series I always wry that the  books will get predictable While some thgs obviously where gog to  happen I was astonished at the surprises that happened throughout the  enire book I love the growg mds of these now teenage characters  Instead of beg children  stuck  time to face their challenges they  are growg Right befe our eyes Harry  the rest are commg of age  The end of this sty had me readg tently as I wished year 5 would come  out sooner As what seems to almost be  not the climax of this 7 part  wonder I'm eagerly awag what will happen next as I know the stakes will  now be even higher than  the past Marvelous book
This was the best book I have ever read!! I am 15 years old (although   may not sound that weird)  I still loved !  I started readg these  books at the begng of the year  have been hooked on them ever sce!  I was overy exced when this book came out  I was to  the whole way  It is packed wh all of the usual surprises  I can't wa f the next  book  the series to come out!! ( so  JK Rowlg reads this please  let me know when  comes out!!! Buchwhack@attglobalnet)  If you are  wonderg whether  not you should get this book then trust me  get    Hope this helps ENJOY!!
I was never really  to readg I mean I did  when I had to    was required to f school but I didn't just s down  read f fun  then one day my mom came hom ewh the whole series so far She thought  they would be good collects ems I like there's no way I'm readg on  my break  not that stuff Well I ate my wds from the moment I picked  up the first one I was hooked I couldn't put them down one by one I  devoured them I couldn't expla  I just really enjoyed them havg  just fished the latest I was creible upset I would have to wa f so  long till I could read what happens next It pleased me greatly to see the  fact that she is startg to cprate boy girl relationship to the  novels I just love these books
I need to start by sayg that I read the book cover to cover  one stg whout so much as a food break  At the same time I was not as  exced about this book as the others  Then aga I am comparg this  Harry to the other Harrys - a tough act to follow !  I know that the  books are gettg &quotdarker&quot but I miss the hum  some of the  crazy suations of the first three  Harry is agg but come on some of  the funniest people on this planet are 14 years old -  they do some pretty  bizarre thgs  There were sections that I wondered why they would be  cluded - I hope they have some purpose  future booksThese books do  appeal to a wide range of readers  I have  will contue to recommend  these books to friends (20s30s40s)  my students (middle school)  I  hope that there is the same variety of people wag  le wh me at  the bookste f number 5 but I'm not sure that will happen
If you are a Harry Potter fan this book defately does not disappot-  you can brg yourself to look past the dust jacket  Of all four of the  books thus far this is not only the best  thickest  is also THE MOST  HIDEOUS LOOKING!  F a book that took so long to wre  one that is  grossg so much  money the publisher should SERIOUSLY takg another look  at  the art that is provided to sell this book  They say you should never  judge a book by 's cover   DEFINATELY holds true  this stance  The sty is well told  me  depth than any of the three previous  books  As most readers know each book has Harry growg a year older   movg through another year at Hogwarts  Wh the crease  age comes  darker themes  the sty  An excellent  very quick read even at 700+  pages!  I give this my highest recommendation just discard the dust jacket   leave  on the shelf!

This is the best book That's all there is to sayPS&gt I CANT BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED W/VOLDMORT!  READ IF U WANT TO FIND OUT!  AUGHHHH!
JK Rowlg is a lerary crack dealer  I'm hooked on her stuff I started readg the first Harry Potter exactly 1 week ago  I'm now  fishg the Goblet of Fire I've been takg my time wh this one  because I know I won't get another fix f a year but the pull is too  strong MUST FINISH BOOK This is the best one yet even though I  haven't fully fished  I hope all of her future HP books are as long   longer than this one because I thk she's free to go to me detail   troduces me characters wh a longer book Harry Potter V 10000 pages  :)
So sighs of relief all round eh? I won't deny my expectations f this book were slightly lower than f those precipatg them I'll be the  first to eat my hat f my trespass! But the consumption of a hat is a  small price to pay compared to the distress I would surely have suffered  had &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot been the dire let-down  I so wrongly fetold  to be The source of my fears was a statement  auth JK Rowlg made some time ago somethg along the les of  &quotThe next Potter book'll be a b evil Oh  I'm killg someone  while I'm at  An nocent of course&quot This fourth stallment   the fantastic saga is doubtless darker than s those gone befe  yes  but  suffers none: auth JK Rowlg embraces realism over escapism wh  The Goblet of Fire but her fiery w - arguably what made the Potter books  such a success  the first place - remas steadfast And wh the darker  tone there's no excuse f us adults to pass this one off as &quotkids'  stuff&quot If you haven't done so already buy yourself a copy of this -   prepare f a good few nights of unbridled enjoyment!
Ok I adm that when I read Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban I didn't thk that JK Rowlg could wre another book that was as good as  that one but this time she has out done herself! Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire may be long but  always keeps you on your toes! It seems  like every where  this book whenever you turn around Harry is  danger  of somethg  that makes  really terestg I thk that havg a  special tournament called the TriWizard Tournament gave the book a very  excg twist because even though I love the Quiddch matches  the  other book  was a break from Quiddch  stead of Harry just tryg  to w the Quiddch Cup he was riskign his le on this excg  tournament that he's not even supposed to be ! I mean a 14 year old is  agast 17  18 year olds! The book is long but 's not drawn out   while  doesn't describe every detail of everythg  does give plenty of  detail so you knwo what is gog on I loved this book even me then the  first 3  anyone who loves Harry Potter  just fantasy books this is a  must read Oh yeah  when is the 5th book comg out!  :-)
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire was a fun book to read I have been keepg up wh the series  fd  a series that you can curl up   sk to I just recently fished the fourth book   was hard to put  down The sty is full of suspense  excment I would recommend this  book to any child  adult havg a hard time readg Once you start you  never will want to fish
I picked up this book wh all the excement I did of the other three Both my eight-year-old  my ten-year-old had read   a few days    was fally my turn As an auth myself (see A GREATER LOVE on Amazon) I  have been fascated wh tryg to underst what makes the HARRY POTTER  books so popular But this time I was disappoted I felt the book should  have been condensed by at least a hundred pages because  dragged   various places And I was also disappoted at the dark turn the novel was  takg It was perfectly all right that there was evil  that someone  dies but the overall feel was dferent from the first three books as  though the evil was perhaps a b glied This wries me so much that I  thk I'll read the next book wh my children aloud just  case I need  to cens   discuss wh them the roles of good  evil I thk  Rowlg has done a great thg gettg so many children to read  her  magical wld is truly amazg I just hope that these books contue  a  posive manner (they are wrten f children)  that the auth leaves  the darkness out
This book is such a great book  It doesn't promote violence  any satanic stuff  This book compared to Kg's books is not gruesome at  all  Yes  gets a ltle darker  has a b of tenso  the end but  s all combed to make a better sty  And yes someone does die but i  do say that  wasn't as big of a shock as I was told  JK Rowlg has  made a surprisg  excg sequel to a sty that just keeps gettg  better  Rowlg left so many loop holes  loose ends  the 4th book  that I'm surprised that there are only gog to be 7 books  the series  I ( many many others) can't wa f the next stallment  I bet 's  gog to be even better then the 4 that she has already wrten
I just fished Harry 4 a day ago What a terric book! I especially loved that stead of the Quiddch match this year there was what I called the &quotOlympics&quot (the challenges wh the kids from the  other schools)  I had read some of the &quotspoilers&quot so I was  anticipatg certa thgs  even wh that Rowlg surprised me!  I  cant wa f the next onewhich will hopefully come out  a matter of  months!  Que a few clfhangers
The 4th Harry Potter is better then 1-3 One Thg:  your gog to read  try an appreciate the detail of the book That's one reason why 's long  another reason that makes  so great It is packed full of  comedy excement  just pure fun You wanna know why Harry's always  the hero? Would the book be to excg  he wasn't? This book is almost  made to be a fantasy biography so don't expect too much about the other  people like Ron  Hermione Another great thg is that Rowlg has  rules f her characters They can't get mad  shoot beams out of their  hs  somethg In this book magic has rules just like the  &quotMuggle&quot wld
Wow! The whole Harry Potter book #4 summed up  one wd Of course I can't just stop there oh no The magic the imagation the superb  wrg the countless hours of igng everythg else except the  evabily of nature  stuff like that but the moment you put that  book down your head is swimmg  thoughts of what will happen next   you want to get done whatever  is so fast to get back to enjoyg  coutless dreamg If you are wag to read the reveiws BEFORE you read  the book igne all the reveiws that are puttg the book down because  you wont be able to When i first heard that there was gog to be a movie  out of the first book my heart sank There is so much to image that   children go  see the movie 'll be like they are beg told what to  image  that's what books are f to image And is watchg the  television supposed to improve their imagations? I thk not That's why  I was so disappionted So  you are an adult READ THESE BOOKS! You will  thank yourself cause i bet you haven't imaged this much sce you were  ltle And  you know of any ltle ones (not too ltle I reccomend  around 7  8 but 's your decision) then take them away to a wld of  magic they will never fget(Still to come: Harry Potter 5 6  7 I  can't wa!)
As a 36-year old mom who has read the three pri HP books out loud to my two girls (ages 9 &amp 7) I set two goals when we received our  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  First I vowed to sav each chapter wh the  kids  not read ahead (as I did wh HP3 racg ahead to fish the book   two evengs  then re-readg wh the kids) Second we would  analyze all of the clues that Rowlg plants throughout the sty   attempt to come closer to figurg out how JKR was gog to surprise us at  the end  As  turns out I did not read ahead  we did very well wh  readg a chapter  two a night to prolong the pleasure of enjoyg Book  Four as long as possibleuntil we reached Chapter 29 At this pot we  aboned all self-disciple  raced through the remag chapters   two three-hour sessions! We also failed miserably  figurg out the  surprise endg(s) It is amazg how Rowlg places the clues so subtly  we have already startg re-readg particular chapters to see how  dferent thgs seem now that we know the endg The book defely  measures up to everythg we were expectg! It is so enjoyable to share  the sty wh my kids -- we each feel that we know the characters so very  well now  we laugh out loud at Hagrid's blast-ended skrewts become  dignant as Malfoy sults Ron's mother  feel pangs of fear as Harry  faces seemgly impossible odds I would defely recommend this book  to anyone who wants to become absbed  a superb sty especially  you  can share  wh your kids!  The Goblet of Fire ( other Potter books)  are great examples to children of stytellg at s best (not to mention  the wonderful lessons of bravery facg fear loyalty etc etc) It will  be a long wa f Book Fivebut we are sure  will be wth the wa  once aga
My 11 year old hasn't had  que a month yet  she's about 400 pages to   I probably slowed her down by stealg the book to read   myself!  Twice!  This is by far the me serious of the 4 Harry Potter  books touchg on issues of social conscience tegry courage   well girls  Harry after all is 14 now  kids DO grow up don't  they  The imagation  wise understg of kids  adults alike  have made these books thoughly enjoyable  In &quotGoblet&quot  seems  to me that Rowlgs is begng to h her stride as an auth  Where  there was some clumsess  the first books both wh use of wds  a  b of straed credibily  the plots this stallment seems to have a  smoother flow hangs together better  We eagerly anticipate that delivery  from Amazon on the release of number 5!
Can I be so bold as to say this is better than the other three ?   lets face    was Harry Potter 4 is credible  so so wth the  waJK Rowlgs had promised 2 cidents  this book death  love  Both are provided but they where so cleverly cluded that they did not  terfere wh the shocks stuns laughs  drama of the book  I had my  own ideas on who would die  I (like many others) was way out  Ooh  wellOnce aga the new characters where just credible  the  existg characters held their own  got me impressive  Mad Eye Moody  is probably the best character yet to show up  he was just phenomal  I have to say the chapter when harry takes a bath  gets stuck  the  stairs is wh out doubt the best chapter from any of the four booksNow we have to look fward  ask questions about book 5  the  endg of the Goblet of Fire leaves so many dos open but we can rest  assured that we will fd me surprises thrills  spillsAs a side  not on a recent trip to Engl I picked up the English release  was  disappoted about how poly  was presented could you image Harry  Potter whout Mary Grpre !
I gally bought this book as a gt f my girlfriend then had the opptuny to read  myself  It was greatly entertag  whout  even readg the first three books  the series I found  very easy to  follow  Though classied as a &quotchildren's book&quot I would  recommend this book f all ages  But don't take my wd f  go   read !
This is to me the best book that JK has wrten so far Its defly wth the money Wh The Tri-wizard tournement Its just enchantg
The fourth book was the greatest book yet!  I thought  was a lot better than the third book  Don't get me wrong the third book was really good (I read  three times) but Harry wasn't gog to die  In the fourth book   was a lot me excg
The 4th Harry Potter book shows the auth gag confidence  developg an creasgly complex realm f fantasy This is becomg a  tense saga  is nicely paced  well-executed Each book is excg   terestg on s own mers  there is a greater payoff when you  read all of them What a joy to read somethg like this!
My husb  I have loved the Harry Potter books  We were disappoted wh this last one  There was too much swearg f a children's book as  well as too many graphic details that a child under 13 should not be  readg Otherwise we liked the book but we would have loved   the  swearg  gruesome details had been left out  After all this is a  childrens book
I got hooked on Harry Potter when I was around when my sister was readg book 4 out loud to my two nieces (ages 15  12)  after two chapters -  I knew I had to start at the begng  I read the first 3  less than a  week -  was totaly enthralled  When  came time f book 4 - I  devoured   two days  As a high school teacher - I am convced that  anythg that will get students to read is a good thg  This goes way  beyond that  What Harry  his friends do is give kids a sence of what  they can  accomplish on their own When  comes right down to  Harry  Ron  company do me by thkg out a problem than by magicially makg   dissappear  All  all - a wonderful series of books -  I can't wa  f #5!
This is probably the most graphic of the Potter novels but I was not as quickly drawn   impressed wh the thrill aspects of the wk As an  adult I expect this to be ftg to fmula What has been so  refreshg over three books Rowlg's sense of adventure  joy   wrg is not as evident here The prose is heavier  she relies a  ltle much on stard-issue style developmentI liked the book  greatly but  just seemed like  wasn't up to speed wh the first  three Those are some high expectations which are ultimately met timidly
Well  took a while f my friends to convce me I had to read these books  I figured I didn't need to be readg children's books no matter  what the content But now I'm hooked  The Goblet of Fire was the best yet  so I assume they're just gog to keep gettg better  I am amazed by  Rowlg's creation  These books are so clever  I'm amazed she has me  to give!  These books should be read by everyone young  old  This book  gave me depth  matury to these growg kids  left me wantg to  open the next one right away  I don't know what I'll do f the next year  whout Harry  Hogwarts!
Ms Rowlg has really outdone herself this time Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire has made me laugh cry quiver  fear  most of all  thk Wh exceptional detail i actually thought i was  the book's  wld of Wizards Wches  Elves The book starts out when Harry is at  the Dursley's house Suprisgly he gets a letter from Ron sayg that  Ron's Father got tickets to the Quiddch Wld cup  wonderg  Harry  would like to come Harry of course excepts  after a comical scene   the Dursley's chimney (yes the Weasleys used Floo Powder)they're off I  would recommend this to everybody but especially to previous Harry Potter  fans The only downside to the book is that  seems to slightly drag on  (after all  does have about 750 pages) wh details but basically   is a GREAT book
My hat is off to J K Rowlg  These books are wonderfully wrten the sties keep us captivated!  I cannot wa f the next stallment of Harry  his adventures  These books are great f kids adults  everyone!  ( I am fussy!)
I LOVED this book  I thk that Rowlg's books keep gettg better  better although my fave remas &quotThe Prisoner of Azkaban&quot  It's a good book full of adventure  emotion but 's funny  sad at  the same time  It really takes a good auth wh a really good  imagation to right a sty this creative  I'm only 13 but I've read a  lot of books  I have to say that Harry Potter is one of the best series  f kids  adults that I have ever read  Hats of to J K Rowlg!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the greatest book  the wld! It's the most excg one so far  's the darkest  most  suspenseful Wh Voldemt back who knows what will happen  the  followg books I'd recommend this book to EVERYONE! It's the thickest   the most excg so far I can't wa f book 5!  Who can!
JK Rowlg's 4th book was an amazg suspenseful book that  kept me up till midnight readg - wantg to know me of the sty  When I fished the book I got an urge to read the next book - know me  This is why I  believe JK Rowlg is a really good auth  I can wa untill the 5th  book coes out!
I am the 27 year old who asked ( relation to the first Harry stalment)   is pathetic f someone my age to love these books so much  I have  had many responses from people who have stated emphatically &quotNO  WAY! &quot  JK Rowlg has created a character who appeals to all of us  youngies  oldies  I spent 3 days  Harry's wld culmatg  the  spectacularly large fourth stalment that kept me rivetted  awake   readg until 430  the mng after which I spent an hour cryg  because I have to wa so long f stalment number 5  I can't reccommend  these books enough  I have already got my friends hooked on this  my  aged aunt is currently readg them all aga f the FOURTH time!  It has  been a long time sce someone has wrten such entertag  enjoyable  books  Hopefully JK Rowlg wont be the last
okay i reallly love the harry potter books they are so imagive  funny  all around great  but when my sister started readg Wizard's  Hall by Jane Yolen she realized that HARRY POTTER IS A TOTAL RIPOFF!  pracally everythg is the same  but WIZARDS HALL WAS PUBLISHED IN  1991makes ya thk dont   well i am MAD MAD MAD  i want everyone to  read WIZARDS HALL AND SEE FOR THEMSELVES! PLEASE EMAIL ME  JULES@TRIADRRCOM IF YOU AGREE W/ ME!  THANK YOU jules
The best of all the harry potters so far You really must read this Have never been so scared  exced (from a book!)  my le have already read  three times can't wa 4 no5
I am 13 yrs old  I read alot (My parents use the wd viracously) I'm not braggg just statg facts but I read this book  two days because   was so good! But besides Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire(Book Four)  my fave book  the series was Harry Potter  The Chamber of  Secrets(Book Two) I really enjoy the Harry Potter books  I will read  them all aga  aga!
Ms Rowlg delivers her most well-wrten of the Harry Potter series thus far  I enjoyed this book immensely  will reread  many me times I  would reccommend this book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire because of  's tricate details  plotle In Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts he is  faced wh much me than the me than unusual staff members  dfucult  assignments Harry is also faced wh a tournament aptly named The  Triwizard Cup of which Harry is extremely overwhelmed  This particular  stallment is so enthrallg to me as a child because of the darker tone  of this novel that adds me matury  depth than the previously  (wonderful) happy-go-lucky humously wrten books Aga I recommend  this book f the reasons that  is wonderfully wrten  enthrallg  f all ages Bravo to Rowlg!

I started readg the Harry Potter books  middle of October  I thought the book was f ltle kids(I'm 15 years old)I like these books tremendously I thought that the fourth book was the best It had the best  plot   was darker than the other books It was the book wh the most  killg  sufferg It was also funniest book so far In the rest of the  books I hope that there will be me YULE BALL ( any other balls) So I  can see what happens Harry Ron Hermonie Cho  Gny's relationships  [] I wonder why did JK Rowlg pick him to be  killed I like the character a lot Now the sty has a twist to  When I  fished the book I had so many unanswered questions I am wonderg the  same thg the whole wld is wonderg When the fth comg out?
There's me  stock f Harry Potter this year than the usual ws broomsticks  magic  This year Harry faces a new callenge  the fm  of a Triwizard Tournament  He has often dreamed of becomg a champion of  Hogwarts School of Wichcraft  Wizardry  This year the opptuny may  very well come to him!   From Triwizard Tournaments to even You-Know-Who  this is a wonderful book that contas tails of mysteries adventure   lots of fun  It's a creative  spirg novel by JK Rowlg  I loved  readg   the rest of the series n can I wa to read the next   le  Until that time I recommend: Circle of magic by Tampra Pierce The  Book of Three The Black Coldran The Castle of Llyar Taran Werer   The High Kg all by Lloyd Alexer
What a wonderful wrer!  I enjoyed the last 3 but this one takes the cake!  A great read f anyone of any age Ms Rowlg can capture anyone's  md!  Good ole Harry is comg of age wh his friends Ron  Hermione!  Don't wa - read  now but read the first 3 befe gettg this one!  Can't wa until the next one comes out
This book is defively _much_ darker than parts I-III  much of the childish charm is missg too On the other h  is very open-ended   seems to be the begng of what could be a most engrossg fantasy  series
I have thoughly enjoyed readg all four of JK Rowlgs 'Harry Potter' books however the first three seemed to be me the same I was pleasantly  suprised  fdg that JK Rowlg has added new characters  dferent  dilemas f Harry to face Five stars as always JK Rowlg leaves us  whout wds to describe her brilliance  lerature
Once aga JK Rowlg manages to enchant readers wh her sty  I was thrilled the entire time  The new animals (Blast-Ended Skrewts  veeta)  whacky characters  amusg love sties make this one the best by far  The whole time you're wonderg about Harry's le  And  leaves many  opptunies f the reader to wonder about Book 5  This book  a way  marks the end of Harry's childhood  the begng of darker years  This  book is great so read  now!
This is the most amazg series of books i have ever read  my le It is spiced up by a combation of features that together make the plot funny terestg mysterious  the biggest mixture of good feelgs  ever Fall  love wh the thick plot that takes you wlds away from our  muggle wld  most imptant of all: there is no age lim f these  books!JK Rowlg you're a genious []
I read 4-5 real books a month  yet can not believe how addictg these books are  After I put this one down  smiled I thought &quotWow the best Harry Potter yet&quot []  I spent the next night on a plane from Boston to  Frankfurt gripped to every sgle on of the 734 pages of this novel - 400  passengers sound asleep  only me awake wh the overhead light on   eye drops  my eyes to keep them from dryg !  What on earth will we do  when Harry graduates from Hogwarts?  Rowlg is just so skilled she has  Hermione nobly fightg 'elf' discrimation  Harry thrust to a magic  school (one from France  another from the &quotnthern  countries&quot) competion (the Triwizard Tournament)  which a  schoolmate actually dies f Harry!  We even have the begngs of a  schoolboy crush f Harry ( his first 'prom-like' experience)  The book  begs wh the International Quiddich Cup event (the Wld Cup f  Wizards) where Ron  the Weasleys take Harry  beg the years'  adventures  ends  another of Rowlg's amazg  absolutely  terryg climax where Harry's pure goodness is enough to defeat the very  evilness of the Ld Valdemt who is growg stronger  a greater danger  wh each novel  The exquise wrg by Rowlg is so subtle that there  is absolutely nothg to make any reader believe that any of this is not  real  Even as an adult there is that child  me who yearns to believe  that there are places like Hogwarts  people like Dumblede  the  universe  And of course as an adult  my heart I know there are!
It is wonderful to know that a particular series just never seems to become bg Although I am a Harry Potter fan I was a b doubtful as to  whether  not &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot would live  up to s expectations I was not at all dissapoted (well except when I  reached the end)  I devoured all seven hundred  thirty-some pages   one huge gulp! The novel opens wh a spooky scene takg place at the old  Riddle House This turns out to be a nightmare so tense that Harry  awakes wh a searg pa  his lightng-bolt-shaped scar We fd out  later that Harry's summer isn't gog too well but that changes as he is  ved to see the Quiddch Wld Cup wh his friends However the game  ends  the happy atmosphere vanishes as a group of Death Eaters (Ld  Voldemt's loyal suppters) are sighted The Dark Mark (the symbol of  death) is then shot to the sky by a mysterious suppter of Voldemt's  The sty contues as Harry  his pals return to Hogwarts School f  their fourth year We learn that stead of the usual Quiddch matches  the famous Triwizard Tournament will take place at Hogwarts this year  Three schools will be competg agast each other  one lucky student  is selected from each school (Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang) to  compete Will Harry be chosen as one of the champions? The tournament  volves three dficult tasks that all of the contenders must complete   each one is full of adventure! We are also troduced to some new  characters among them Ra Skeeter (a nosy news repter)  Barty Crouch  (a very strict man wkg f the Misty of Magic) Readers are also  presented wh some puzzlg questions Could Alast &quotMad-Eye&quot  Moody the new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher be me than the  kdly wise man that he appears to be? Could Ld Voldemt possibly  return to power? As always JK Rowlg manages to concoct an excg  answer to these questions MsRowlg's terestg hum  w is shown   this sty as well She cludes jokes  puns  this book that both  children  adults will underst And as you may have heard  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is a lot darker than the other Potter books  There will be death there will be blood I do not suggest that you read  the last five  so chapters  the dark Anyway the book has a fantastic  endg but  does not satisfy the reader It leaves them hangg wag  f the next Potter novel! Very rarely does a &quottrue classic&quot come  alonga sty that will be remembered fever  that also cludes  action fantasy hum hr etc  one book &quotHarry Potter   the Goblet of Fire&quot fulfills both of these requirements  a lot  me besides I very very highly recommend this book to anyone who loves  adventure excement  tons of surprises along the way!o these questions MsRowlg's terestg hum  w is shown   this sty as well She cludes jokes  puns  this book that both  children  adults will underst And as you may have heard  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is a lot darker than the other Potter books  There will be death there will be blood I do not suggest that you read  the last five  so chapters  the dark Anyway the book has a fantastic  endg but  does not satisfy the reader It leaves them hangg wag  f the next Potter novel!

This is a great book! F all Harry Potter fans  just those wh great imagations Jk Rowlg takes you on a wild ride full of mystery   twists you'd never thk of  Although listed as a childrens  book  is  f everyone who is a child at heart  loves a good fantasy book It is  long  lenghth but I couldn't put  down anyway I highly recommend this  book
Enterg the wld of Harry Potter is better than livg all the fantasies you had growg up - because 's all made real through every wd  You  beg to live the characters  move to their wld  One moment you  have magic spells  dragons to deal wh  The next you fd yourself  experiencg the joys  pas of becomg a teenager  The sty is  extradarily well developed  It never stops  always makes you want  to keep gog  This is a perfect series of books that truly gets better  each time you pick them up  The character names  sty les will  become embedded  your md  Book #5 cannot come soon enough
Trust me this book was wth the wa Full of suspense  mystery the 4th stallment  the Harry Potter set was just as excg  que  lerally magical as the last 3 books  Though Quidch doesn't play  as large a part  this book as  does others the wld cup is excg   even   is disapiontg that  takes such a small role the plot   this book well makes up f   I'm not tellg any me except to  say1) This book is deed much darker The Dark Ld ruthlessly  persues Harry through out this novel2) The sparks between Ron   Hermione are even me obvious3)If you like Quidch you will love  readg about the Triwizard tournament  Take my wd f  you  liked the others books you will not be able to resist this onea great  sty f all ages!
Rowlg takes her time to build up the scenes so readers had better be patient Many times I lted my eyes from the book  wondered &quotDoes  she REALLY need to go through wh all these sub-plots?&quot Somehow I  doubt  (also the joke volvg a planet raises the eyebrow Com'on was   really necessary? Surely one can wre a decent even brilliant book  whout addg tasteless jokes) Still at the end of the book one does  feel that she has successfully enlarged the plot troducg many  trigug possibilies Also there is a sense of an impendg show-down  between the fces of Good  Evil Though Snape is the character I would  like to hate the most he's probably the only one  the book who refuses  to be categised as the Good Guy  the Nasty Guy The book just barely  reaches expectations okay the fahful servant of Voldemt is pretty  hard to guess but the one who would die was pretty obvious And  dissapotg MAJOR character? Sez who?  I don't dare say me f fear of  revealg too much but I was prepared to 'sacrice' bigger me  well-developed characters to feel the grief that reviews had been preparg  me f The endg when they were asked to remember _____ (the one who  died) was pretty cny I thought Let's not stoop to facetiousness One  last question There was a superb opptuny  the book to talk about  slavery but the book glosses over  Apparently there are creatures who  love beg slaves This might be a really igal theme  the histy of  lerature It wasn't amusg n did  contribute much to the general  plot so why this approach?
THIS BOOK IS SUPER-DE-DUPER BECAUSE IT SHOWS MORE OF HARRYPOTTER'S LIFE AS A WIZARD LEARNING HIS SKILLS  HE IS VERY INTERESTING AND IF YOU READ ANY OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE!
I've read the first three books 9 times each  cant get enough of themI'm readg the fourth book f the 3'rd time now  I keep rereadg  the endg which is credible  makes you feel like you are right there  wh him The fourth book is much darker  much me excg than any of  the others  the triwizard tournament gives  a certa action packed  edge It has so many thgs happeng that  keeps you guesg all the way  through  there is only one wd to describe   BRILLIANT!
I AM A LOT OLDER THAN THE RECOMMENDED READING AGE BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE SECOND BOOK
I can't believe how much I love this series  And JK Rowlg did not  disappot me wh this new book  As the series contues the depth of  Harry's wld exps  becomes me complex  The only that disappots  me is that I won't know the next chapter  the saga until 2001!
Rowlg is frequently mentioned  the same breath as the fantasy greats J Tolkien  CS Lewis  This is unmered because the wks of Tolkien   Lewis go far beyond the level of sty - they impart great truths about  human nature  theology on a deeper level  Rowlg's novels do not have  such a deeper level but are simply books which entertaThat is not to  say that Rowlg's novels are not good  They clearly are  The credible  sales recd of the Harry Potter series tells s own sty of success   As a fantasy sty-teller about the wld of magic Rowlg is  undeniably skilled  Many of Rowlg's concepts are strongly remiscent of  the brilliant children's fantasy fiction by Enid Blyton  Roald Dahl   she likely has been fluenced by their wkHowever Rowlg clearly  has a style of her own   this fourth book of the Harry Potter series  has confirmed her reputation as a sty-teller f children  This novel  has all the gredients of a good children's novel - suspense imagation   excement  Most imptantly children can identy wh s  characters  Although Rowlg describes a fantasy wld that exists only   her imagation  the reader's  is clear that this fantasy wld is  largely a mirr image of our own 20th century Western wld  What makes  this series so successful is that people recognize themselves  the novel  - their school le (Hogwarts) their human rights ideology (Hermione's  fight f the elves) their wship of team spts (the quiddich wld cup)   dividual spts (the tri-wizard contest) their polical wld  (mistry of magic) their media (terviews wh the Daily Prophet) their  concern wh health  beauty their relationships between guys  girls   their love of feastg  food (The Yule Ball) Although Harry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire is about a fantasy wld ultimately  is  about ourselves  And that is why we love   Highly recommended!
I can't believe how much I love this series  And JK Rowlg did not disappot me wh this new book  As the series contues the depth of Harry's wld exps  becomes me complex  The only that disappots  me is that I won't know the next chapter  the saga until 2001!
As a well-read 30 yr old professional I cannot believe how captivated I am wh these books!  I equate  to rereadg Alice  Wonderl  The  LionThe Wch the Wardrobe-wrten f children but always good f  the young at heart  those wh a great imagation  Just one  question-how long until book 5?  I can't wa!  Buy the series- you won't  regret !
Trust me this book was wth the wa Full of suspense  mystery the 4th stallment  the Harry Potter set was just as excg  que  lerally magical as the last 3 books        Though Quidch doesn't play  as large a part  this book as  does others the wld cup is excg   even   is disapiontg that  takes such a small role the plot   this book well makes up f         I'm not tellg any me except to  say1) This book is deed much darker The Dark Ld ruthlessly  persues Harry through out this novel2) The sparks between Ron   Hermione are even me obvious3)If you like Quidch you will love  readg about the Triwizard tournament    Take my wd f  you  liked the others books you will not be able to resist this onea great  sty f all ages!
This book is absolutly AMAZING! When I was readg  I couldn't put  down! It's defatly darker than the other books though I know people  thk that because the book is so long  will be bg but  isn't  There is a new adventure  every chapter  lots of danger Plus  you  haven't already heard someone diesOHhhhh (creepy isn't ?) The begg  is dferent too All I have to say is that the book is wth every penny  of the price  I know you will love 
I really really enjoyed this book I'm 14 same age as Harry but not many people my age (that I know) read these books That's a shame I say  so I always brg my copies to school  loan them out (One of my friends  called me her Librarian) I just really thk that everyone should read  these books because they're funny but at the same time very serious You  exercise your imagation  no matter how cheesy  sounds you learn  somethg too Everytime I read one of these books I just kd of have to  s thkg of everythg new I've learned from  In book #4 I'm even  me crazy to get to the next book because this one is defely me of  a clfhanger than the other three While  was over twice as long   seemed shter because I still have so many unanswered questions I'm just  wag f next year  the next book    
Like the other books  the series one gets caught up  the magical wld until  seems as though Harry's wld IS the nmal wld! By the fourth  book (read the first three first) we are familiar wh the terms  know  the characters so Rowllg is free to add all sts of new fmation   plot twists It's also a me serious book that does not shy away from  pa loneless  as everyone knows - death The appeal f adults is   the clever use of common terms  knowledge to create a new  fresh  outlook on what just might be! BTW the illustrations by Grpre  the US  Scholastic edion (cover  side)  are by far better than the UK  Bloomsbury one
I am a 43 year old elementary teacher  I have to say that I am under the Harry Potter spell!  I have read all four of J K Rowlg's Harry  Potter books  anxiously awa each new one  Once you start to read  these books you fall to a fantasy wld unlike any other  prt today!  I am an avid reader of children's lerature as well as adult lerature   the Harry Potter series are among my fave  I highly suggest all  teachers to read these books then read them to your students!  Any adult  as well as a child who enjoys children's lerature will surely enjoy  these books!
This was the best book out of the series  I thoughly enjoyed the first three  didn't really thk that the fourth book would be as good  I was  wrong  was better  Aga Rowlg succeeds  craftg a great tale  developg unfgettable characters  chartg the path from youth to  adulthood  a realistic  entertag manner  Every time I read the  Harry Potter books I try to figure out the endg befe 's revealed   each time Rowlg manages to surprise me  Everyone should read this  series!
Hi my name is Christe  I'm a Harry Potter addict By now isn't there supposed to be a Harry Potter's Anonymous (HPA) of some sts? I'm  not alone  this addiction I'm sure There is a quiet understg  amongst all of us HP fans A ltle boy looks over at me on the No 1 tra   screams &quotI read that one! I can't wa to read Harry Potter one  gazillion  four!&quot A middle aged woman peers over from my right  wh a small smirk on her face  a Prisoner of Azkaban on her lap Goblet  of Fire is excellent  testies to Rowlg's great imagation   talent BUT BLIMELY WHY IS IT LONGER THAN WAR AND PEACE!  Mrs Rowlg  please we beg of you to make the fth one no bigger than our  encyclopedias My shoulders will thank you very much
Rowlg has made fiction look like fact is  fact that we thk is fiction? This whe nuckel ride goes from un-lovg relatives to a  wchcraft  wizardg school where the dynamic trio(Harry Hermione   Ron) fd secrets lurkg  every human soul This book is dferent than  any of the others  the series but  a way a lot better If you like  fiction you will love Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire  I encourage  you to read 
Harry Potter number 4 is no doubt the best book yet  JK Rowlg's dyname series Wh great new characters excg plot twists  lots  of danger  suspense you won't be able to put the book down   readg  once defely isn't enough Although  could be put next to  &quotclf-hanger&quot  the dictionary many questions are answered   pasts revealed though even me questions arise You fally meet Ron's  oldest brothers Bill  Charlie  the entire Weasley family has a  large part  the sty There are re-appearances of Sirius Black the  Maurader's Map Ld Voldemt ( should I say You-know-who)  even  Moang Myrtle There are great new characters from the Mestry of Magic   2 other schools which have come to compete  the excg Triwizard  Tournament - f the first time  over a century!

Only wds like &quotstunng&quot &quotwonderful&quot  &quotgrippg&quot can describe JK Rowlg's latest masterpiece  This  4th book  her 7 part Harry Potter series is by far her best most action  packed rivg novel to date  Harry's wld is presented  vivid  detail as we have come to expect from Rowlg  not a chapter goes by  that doesn't leave the reader wantg me  Follow Harry Ron   Hermione to another year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry   hold on f the ride of your le  New friends bolder enemies   thrillg twists  turns leave the reader searchg f pieces of a gr   marvelous puzzle which Rowlg has so expertly created  This book  takes us to a wld so ventive that  parallels CS Lewis's  &quotNarna&quot as well as Lewis Carroll's &quotWonderl&quot  F  both young  old alike this book (along wh s three predecesss)  remds us of the magic of childhood  the hero  us all  Harry Potter  fans: this book both satisfies  leaves you wantg me at the same time  - a sign of an excellent auth  It's a must read f anyone who has  followed Harry this far  And  you haven't met Harry yet I suggest  lookg f him  his cupboardhe'll be wag f you there
I bought The Goblet of Fire  The Prisoner of Azkaban at the same time just to see what the hype was about  I read both books   5 days  now  I am a fan  Goblet of Fire is  has our hero Harry Potter competg   a  prestigious  wizard tournament   his 4th year  at Hogwarts  school  Harry displays feats of bravery  courage like attemptg to get past a  dragon while flyg on a broomstick   gog through a maze  full of  dangerous creatures  Familliar characters return like Harry's best friends  Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger as well as a host of other memable  characters  The endg of the book left me eagerly anticipatg the next  stallment  this imagative  enjoyable series

A lot of reviews I've seen on this se say &quotstripe all the bad wds wh a black marker  wre another wd&quot  Really how stupid is  that?  Ms Rowlg is sayg that as people get older they get exped  diolague  even though Moody says some  others I don't thk 's  bad  I've also seen that there's too much violence  I've been thkg  &quotOK you won't let your kids see PG movies&quot  Sure 's dark  wh the big fight wh You-Know-Who  Harry  wh Mr Crouch   everythg  But the books is really goodThe Yule ball is the best  part because of everythg  However 's like the last book they say  &quotfourth years  older&quot  Hogsmeade &quotthird years   older&quot  In this book you fd out a ltle me about the stg  hat  You fd out why Hagrid is so big  Somebody dies (I won't say who  except 's a pretty m character)  And probably the best part is  Harry  his girlfriend named Cho Chang  Thought 's the longest 's  the best

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far the darkestbut best Harry Potter book  the series about the young wizard I could barely put the  book down due to the suspence that JK Rowlg puts at the end of each  chapter The bookwhich is an amazg 734 pages follows the young wizard   his friends Hermionie Granger  Ron Weasley through probably  the  sadest year they will face at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  Rowlg puts the magic touch  this book which has humsadnessdrama   plenty of action as she wrtes the pivotal 4th book  the 7 book  series She leaves you off wh a clfhanger which will make you start  countg the days until Harry Potter 5 comes out  wh the knoeledge  that the next 3 years at Hogwarts will be the most excg that you have  ever read  any book whatsoever
Rowlg has made fiction look like fact is  fact that we thk is fiction? This whe nuckel ride goes from un-lovg relatives to a  wchcraft  wizardg school where the dynamic trio(Harry Hermione   Ron) fd secrets lurkg  every human soul This book is dferent than  any of the others  the series but  a way a lot better If you like  fiction you will love Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire  I encourage  you to read

That is one simple one syllabled wd that describes Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Wow  Not only did I fish all 733 pages  under 12  hours I enjoyed every second of   This book has lived up to the  stards set by the precedg Harry Potter books  The book was everythg  I hoped  to be  It was fun enjoyable wh many signature Harry Potter  twists  plot  I really enjoyed   This is my fave Harry Potter  book along wh book number 3  Both of those books were simply amazg  The thg that impresses me the most about the books is that JK Rowlg  makes every book eher better  just as good as the precedg book  These books are so good you couldn't help but thk that she used a b of  &quotmagic&quot herself
Ms Rowlg must be related to Albert Este!  The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series has been anticipated f f about eight months  And  has lived up to all the hype  This year the famous wizard Harry  Potter wants to be a nmal wizard  He wants to go to the quiddch cup  wh his friends  And he does  I thk this is the most vividly described  part of the whole book  The tents of the wizards can take you to a state  of utter amazement  He want to know about the event volvg two rival  schools that will take place at Hogwarts  And he does  It is the  triwizard competion  Three champions over seventeen will be picked to  complete three tasks  But Harry is picked as the fourth champion  He  wants to be a nmal wizard  But he isn't  And  could be deadly  Long  befe the fourth stallment Ms Rowlg warned us that this episode would  be darker  It does not encourage children to jo the occult  such  strange nonsense people have cooked up  It is a wk of FICTION  read  f enjoyment  And I enjoyed  immensly  know anybody else will too  If there is ever a proposal f an eighth wonder of the wld this series  will be on the list of choices  This is the book that has gotten children  to read 734 pages of utter magic over the summer  Thk  over
this is what i'll call a great book i mean how many auths can really make you feel wh the charcaters  we can actually visualise what is  happeng as the sty moves along jk rowlg is really good  the  sense that she exps the settg every time a new book comes out stead  of confg only to hogwarts we are brought to the quiddch wld cup  the undersea the graveyard  many me dear reader  you want  somethg that will tug at your heartstrg  yet matured enough f you  wa no me! read the book  see f yourself!
This book is one of the best I have read sce I was first troduced to the brothers grimm fairy tales! I feel like i know harry  that he is  real! I wish there wern't only gog to be seven I could read them fever  they are defatly gog down  histy labeled CLASSICS!
I ALWAYS read my kids books first The Harry Potter Books are the best to come around  a long time  They honestly are a great read f kids AND  adults  JK Rowlg doesn't (like most auths of kids books) dumb down her  wrtg f kids  They also conta great le lessons about acceptance  Get these books f your kids  read them yourself -)

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful addion to the ever-growg Harry Potter saga  It contas everythg I loved  the  first three books plus me  This book along wh the other Harry Potter  books is very well ganized  The plot's twists  turns are a  playground f the imagation yet leave ltle to wonder about  Rowlg  tells Harry's sty  a way that children can underst  adults can  appreciate  I am lookg fward to Harry's next adventure!
Not many wds can describe this book It is absolutly compellg It is a wk of beautul art I all really is have to say is  you havn't read   you need to hurry up  do so  else you will be loosg out on a  fabulous treat
My children  I sat together  took turns readg all four books out loud Book four only took us three days! Laughter is fectious especially when that child is rollg on the flo My teenagers aren't the only ones  recommendg others to read them One of my kids has read each of the first  three books 3-5 times I'm afraid they will wear out! Have a good read
Hi hi hi! I really really loved &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot It was scary  parts but even me excg than the other ones It was a big book but I couldn't put  down! My fave character  is Hermione because she is very very smart Well I have to go now   read  aga
This book is really good  It is fun of unexpected twists  turn Once you thk you have thgs figured out some thg else happens to totally blow your they of what might be gog on way off  I couldn't put  down  It's not as scary as everyone says  is though  I thk JK  Rowlg has a great imagation  I can't wa f the next one
JK Rowlg presents a truly credible novel! Wy humus this book is top priy!  Harry is a fth year  he  his best friends Ron  Hermione help him through this atventure packed year It all starts  when Ron Weasly takes him to the Quiddch Wld Cupthen the adventure  pours out! Amazag sty that will have you beggg f me!
Whoa! What is  wh these books? Half the earth's entire population ( cludg me) loves them! These are the most popular books  years Kids why s around wathg Pokemon  other junk when you can read these? How  can people say these books are evil of all thgs! It's a STORY people a  STORY! A sty that gets both adults  kids me than terested Harry  Potter #4 is as good  not better than the rest  The book begs wh  Harry gog to the Quiddch ( crect spellg?) Wld Cup( after a  somewhat easy struggle wh the Durselys) Strange thgs happen there  cludg an appearrance of Voldemt's special signal This confirms  Harry's fear that Voldemt is gettg powerful an idea he gets from a  strange  que realistic dream Harry Potter learns a very excg  although disapotg tidb when he arrives at Hogwarts School A  tournament is to be held agast two other magic schools  only anyone  seventeen  older can compete Many thgs happen as Harry struggles  through his fourth year at Hogwarts good  very bad I like the ltle  details like Ra Skeeter's articles Cho Chang  Harry seeg memies  of Dumblede And readers are defly  f a surprise at the very last  few chapters I don't want to ru that surprise The plot of Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire is amazgly well contrtructed  moves along very  fast  There is no one I wouldn't reccomend this book to I can fd no  faults Buy  fast  you  haven't already
A warng to all new readers as soon as you pick this up  won't go down tell 's done Harry Potter has captured the eyes of young readers from Germany to Canada  all children have the same response &quotWhen can I get the next one?&quot Harry Potter is a book I will always be readg to  my Sisters then My Children And then my grchildren Thank you JK  Rowlg f wrg such a wonderful series
Aga another great one from Ms Rowlg Every day of the wa between the third part  the recent one was wth  Although this one is much bigger  much me dark than any of the previous ones I loved almost  every b of  Unlike the other three this time I was completely  clueless until the very end as to who the collabat of the dark ld  was The other three were also extremely suspenseful  que surprisg  at the end I happened to guess eher crectly   the ball park) The  death  the encounter of Voldemt wh the protagonist has made the  sty me edgy me suspenseful  the encounter of Harry wh his  victimized parents due to reverse spell made  a very subtle  poignant  moment The imagery the sty tellg novatively imagative ideas of  ptkey WWN  gillyweed  me made the whole plot even me  terestg  full of surprisesAlso the ternationalization of the  wizardg wld the subtle but clear suations to the over enthusiatic  press  our regular wld  through the character of Ra Skeeter rendered  an extra dimension to this seriesAll  all we all know that this book  is makg histy  the publishg wld I must say that wh the turn of  events at the end of this current volume the progression will be even me  terestg vivid  the eternal struggle between good  evil will be  played out  a me direct mannerAlso a pot to note this series  has another underlyg lesson &quotdferent does not mean evil there  are goods  evils  types  kds&quotAga congratulations to  the auth f keepg  up to her previous successes
Though not the age these series was wrten f (I'm 26) I really liked all of them And they are gettg better every book!I like the 4th book most because  is a ltle darker but the funny thgs did not disappear  at all Another reason I like the book is that  has me pages than the  other 3 books so you can stay longer  Harry's wldCan't wa f  HP5!
By the time you child is 11 'damn' will be commen language school even  your child isn't usg  By thirteen your childwill know terrible wds! Even a SEVEN year old will love the book so much they wont even notice 'damn' is there! I am a kid  I didn't even know Harry Potter HAD swearg   until I read someone's review warng people!  Your child simply cannot have bad wds marked out  replaced 's  A BOOK  Even  your child is shocked they wont mention  because they are embaressed! Besides the fth Harry Potter is pretty strong f seven year olds anyway they shouldn't be readg   Also puttg a few 'damns'  makes the sty seem me beleivable The day I see a class of fourteen year olds usg just 'damn' I will be speakg a dferent language
While this book has certaly garnered 's fair share of reviews - I felt that I had to add one me I have read all of the Harry Potter books  I simply loved number four I have also never been stopped by so many  strangers on the street to be asked about a book It seems as tho everyone  wanted to know how the book was   I had read the previous three I  told everyone that still has an ner child to run out  buy this book  (as well as the first three)JK Rowlg seems to be gettg better wh  age  experience as does Harry She has really exped her wgs  this  stallment of the Harry Potter seriesWhile the book begs exactly  the same as the past three books - wh Harry stuck at the Dursley's f  the summer  his friends the Weasley's must rescue him so that he can go  to the Quiddch wld cup falsBut this is where the similaries  stop  the real imagation begs Whout sayg too much - this novel  is (obviously) longer than the previous three  while most people were  stunned at the start of the book - I thk I can safely say no one wanted   to end I would have been happy wh another hundred pagesThgs  turn f Harry  number four - as he reaches adolescences he has to deal  wh all the ups  downs  brgs wh  a first crush  a paful  loss as well as tauntg  tryg to discover who he really isThis  book is once aga a triumph f readers of all ages So s down  enjoy  the ride
This latest Harry Potter book was everythg I expected  to be Harry matures through the sty as does the content The book gets darker  darker as Harry's troubles become closer It has an excellent sense of  mystery  keeps you guessg about several issues all at once This time  Harry's problems come to him stead of his trouble makg habs comg  out Don't get me wrong he's as darg as ever but he's fced to  suations by someone elses dogs The end of the book left me wh so  many unanswered questions I'm thirstg f me  I can't wa until  the 5th year
Is everyone who reviewed this book from USA? Harry Potter is a Brish boy  the books are wonderfully UK! We (my family) love all 4  my younger kids s enthralled as I read the latest one out I love dog the voices  f Malfoy  Hagrid  Aunt Petunia  the rest These books are so  wonderfully ventive  yet reflect le too Just read the chapters  where Ron  Harry are tryg to arrange dates f the Yule Ball - JK gets  the adolescent thg so exactly right - these are my favoure  chaptersFull marks to Hermione!  And full marks to JK Rowlg f superb  wrg  great suspense  fun
I really enjoyed readg this book JK Rowlg never disappots readers I fished readg   three days The sty was fascatg  every page was full of hums  surprisesThis book is a combation of  suspense hum action  teenage romanceI especially liked the chapters  THE GOBLET OF FIRE  THE YULE BALL Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  is a result of JKRowlg's solid wk  efft The best children's  book of the millenium!
This book will not disappot true Harry Potter fans  I did enjoy Harry's new adventures  his fourth year at Hogwarts  However this book alone would not persuade a doubtful child  parent that the Harry Potter series  is wth mer  F one reason the size is very timidatg  I can not  see myself hg over a seven-hundred  thirty-four page book to a  child to get them terested  readg  They would feel overwhelmed   give up after the first two chapters possibly from fatigue at just  carryg the book around  (The first book  the Harry Potter series would  be better sued to get a child terested  readg)  Second the  nocence of the characters is severely dimished  One might argue that  they're gettg older but  just came as a big surprise to me  One such  example is when Ron mentions the planet Uranus ( 's double meang)   relation to a fellow student  I found this appropriate f adolescent  hum  Third a house-elf  the  sty drowns her srow  a substance  that wks similar to alcohol  This presents an all too often seen message  f depressed adolescents to turn to drugs to solve their problems  There  goes all of DARE's hard wk!  The house-elf never deals wh her srow   ends her part  the book sobbg uncontrollably  While Hogwarts   the whole magical wld has always been filled wh wches  wizards  their themes  attributes seem me pronounced  this book  Me  attention is given to poted hats  the stard &quotwch   wizard&quot attributes than  previous books  The endg scene wh  Voldemt is very disturbg  seems to have been wrten f crics to  focus on  Never befe has a Potter book seemed close to Satanic ruals   cult-like followgs  This is not true of the fourth book  I really  enjoyed the development of Hermione's character  She is quickly becomg  my fave next to Harry that is!  This cric did not let the above  stop her from thoughly enjoyg the book  wag on bated breath f  the next  (Especially the way  ended)  Regardless I can not see myself  hg  over to an nocent adolescent whout stoppg to discuss wh  them durg key pots  the bookop her from thoughly enjoyg the book  wag on bated breath f  the next  (Especially the way  ended)  Regardless I can not see myself  hg  over to an nocent adolescent whout stoppg to discuss wh  them durg key pots  the book
What impact! What else can another auth say! I had a book signg f my novel &quotRapid Descent- Disaster  Boston Harb&quot  a NH book ste the day &quotGoblet&quot was released My book sold well that day  because the le f the latest Potter book went past my signg table!  Congratulations Ms Rowlg we should all be so ftunate Oprah has  me  I'm patiently wag!
OK I adm: I love to read these books I am completely addicted  JK Rowlg is a genius  The fourth book is the best book to date  I hope she can contue to wre this series I may become lost  somethg where  to happen to herIn this book Harry's wld becomes me complex  a lot  of background fmation is brought out about his past It is a fantastic  journey that leaves you wantg me  thkg about the future of  Harry  What I need now is book fivePS I personally do not know any  children who have read these books although I would endse them to any  child The NY Times should be ashamed at makg a new section f  children's books so 'adult' books can be shown  the top 10  Wh all  respect to Daniel Steel the Potter books are a much better read f any  adult  They convey the classical lerary ideals of good vs evil the  search f truth  pure unadulterated fun  You can not say that f many  of this past weeks NY Times 'adult' best sellers
JK Rowlg's **Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire** was the largest first prtg  the histy!  And almost all of those magnicent books were read  neatly lovely read aga  I know one person who  after gog out at midnight to buy this pivotal novel stayed up till 7:00  AM readg   This book has mesmerized millions of children  adults  This book was an dulgg wk of art Rowlg has fally  ptrayed these 14 year-old young adults realistically  She has also done  a magical job brg the Dark Ld back whout havg to complicate  everythg else gog on ie The Qutich Wld Cup  The Triwizard  Tournament  All''all I would recommend this book to anyone  who doesn't md pickg up a book  readg one chapter  Because   any of the books that's all you need to read to be hooked!
My mother gave me the first Harry Potter book f my grchildren  I felt I should read  first to see the content I was hooked immediately  I haven't had so much fun wh a new auth  years  I read part of one  of the books wh a grson  enjoyed  thoughly  He was 9 at the  time  we had a ball takg turns readg a few pages each  I am sure of  Harry Potter's adventures will be as dramatic  suspenseful wh just  the right endg as the first four  I tend to give all 4 books to my  other grchildren (11 of them) f Christmas
this is the best book i have ever read  i thk  is the best one  the series but that is my opion  Dont listen to the reviewers on tv what they say is a bunch of bull i thk  buy  now you will be  surprised frightend  most of all enjoy the book
It took me two weeks of gog from bookste to bookste  greater Washgton DC area  hearg the same wds &quotout of stock&quot &quotsold out&quot befe I remembered that I could der Goblet of Fire  onle from Amazon As I had read the first three books (one a day)   enjoyed them tremendously I was really frustrated not beg able to get my  hs on the fourth book soon enough It was wth the wa Clearly wh  s 750+ pages this was not a book to be read  one day (me like two   a half) Meover knowg that there was no fth book available I  had to sav  Havg grown up imagg myself a wch I enjoyed the  Harry Potter books greatly I must adm after the first three books I  wished the women/young girl characters were a ltle me mischievous   fun The fourth book defely goes farther along  that direction  Lookg fward to the fth book but not the movie!
While this book has certaly gotten me than 's fair share of reviews - I needed to add me I've read all the Harry Potter books  I loved number four I brought the book wh where ever I went  I have never  been stopped by so many strangers on the street to be asked about a book  It seems as tho everyone wanted to know how the book was   I had read  the previous three I told everyone that still has an ner child to run  out  buy this book (as well as the first three)  JK Rowlg  seems to be gettg better wh age  experience as does Harry She has  really spread her wgs  this stallment of the Harry Potter series  While the book begs exactly the same as the past three books - wh Harry  stuck at the Dursley's f the summer  his friends the Weasley's must  rescue him so that he can go to the Quiddch wld cup fals - readers  will be happily pleased wh the rest of the book  But this is  where the similaries stop  the real imagation begs Whout sayg  too much - this novel is (obviously) longer than the previous three   while most people were stunned at the start of the book - I thk I can  safely say no one wanted  to end I would have been happy wh another  hundred pages Thgs turn f Harry  number four - as he reaches  adolescences he has to deal wh all the ups  downs  brgs wh  a  first crush  a paful loss as well as tauntg  tryg to discover  who he really isThis once aga a triumph f readers of all ages So  s down  enjoy the ride
What can I say?  What is there to say?  This was a very good book wh a very colful cast of chacters  Dudley is on a diet the Quiddch Wld Cup is this year  someone is comg back  It all begs when Harry  recives a letter from Ron vg him to the Wld Cup match  He glady  excepts  the Dursleys happily let him go glad to have him gone early  Harry happiliy looks fward to the day when he will leave but when   comes the Weasley's make a large mistake  They decide to arrive by Floo  powder!

If you have not read the previous Harry Potter novels do not start wh this one  You will fd  much me enjoyable to read them  der  If you have not read any of them   you enjoyed the Ld of the Rgs  the Chronicles of Narnia  similar series this will be a treat f you  Readg them  der will only delay your readg of Goblet of Fire by a  week  so: they go fast!  J K Rowlg's novels keep gettg better  The  first one (Scerer's Stone) was que good  the second (Chamber) had a  hard time equallg  but the third one (Azkaban) was clearly superi to  s predecesss  In some ways 's better than number four (Goblet of  Fire)  Goblet is perhaps a b too long but the qualy of wrg is  very high  It is easy to see why kids read these books over  over  Many books are not wth re-readg but these sties reward the repeat  reader  I can't wa to get the UK edions to see what changes were made  f the American market  That will help pass the time while wag f  number 5!
I was a second grade teacher last year  am gog to be the school media specialist next year  I love these books  I am takg classes f my masters  would read Harry after I fished my homewk  I actually  didn't go to bed one night  It made f an terestg followg day! I  could go on  on about the posive pots but I won't  The book is not  f all  However f the first time  pop cultural histy the buzz is  well deserved
I have read many reviews from this se that say  is apropriate f children  is And you know why s a young adult book The auth never tended f this to rema a childrens series she has said the books will  contue to get darker  darker  mood  less appropriate f the  second  third graders who are readg this book! The characters aren't  even kids anyme they're teenagers by the next book they'll be almost  old enought to drive Personally I'm 16  I loved the book I thought   was well wrten  a great read
Book IV is a fantastic entry to the growg saga of young wizard Harry Potter The first 150 pages  so seem a b slow compared to the begngs of the pri volumes  the series but persist good reader! After that the sty quickly picks up  escalates to a dizzyg tale of suspense by the end at which pot the seemg slowness of the first ption is explaed Que masterfully done Book IV also shows the begng of Harry's growth to adulthood wh s responsibilies  s heartaches cludg one grim lesson: Sometimes the good guy has to content himself wh gettg out alive stead of wng I devoured this book  one stg (about 7 hours)  am now somewhat disgruntled that  will be another year befe I can contue wh this trigug series This is stytellg at s fest Very highly recommended f all ages
The book is too long  is the weakest book  the series so far  I know 's hard to susta the level of vention  hum that made the first three books so enjoyable  JK Rowlg had a heavy load of expectations to  carry after beg propelled to the top of the best seller list  But she  has failed to follow her muse down the paths of whimsy that made the  earlier books wthwhile  It's a shame that she recycled to some of the  elements of plots from previous books but maybe the readg public  shouldn't place such hopes on her creativyI wish there had been  me dialogue  That was one of the most enjoyable parts of the earlier  books  All  all  would have be nice  she had had a lighter style  even  the content is heavier
I won't waste time reviewg the plot as  is given above but I would like to express my pleasure at how well-wrten  telligent all of JK Rowlg's books have been  It is nice to  fd a children's book series  that is entertag  isn't patronizg  nature I thk that Harry  Potter's populary among adults as well speaks to that fact  I don't  thk there has been as good a children's wrer sce Roald Dahl  As to  the accusations of celebratg the occult I say have some imagation!  Didn't you want to have special powers when you were 11?  Curl up wh  Harry  the wld of Hogwarts have a good giggle  try to guess where  the next plot twist will take you  I'm eagerly awag book 5
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was one of the best books I've read  a LONG time  Though s thickness (734  so pages) might scare some people away  was defatly wth the wa!  As soon as I get  I read   from begng to end f ne hours wh only breaks to eat  I stayed  up till 3 am on July 9th!  Anyway I liked  especially because  got  away from the nmal route of Harry's le  The book opened   midsummer  Harry didn't immediatly go back to Hogwarts he did some  other thgs first  And the nmal route of Hogwarts le is teruppted   mid October But I won't spoil the plot  As Harry  his friends  mature the nature of the books mature  Goblet of Fire is darker than the  precedg three  though  has a happy endg there is a death  a  startlg conclusion that will drastically change many many events  the  books to come  I can't wa f Book Five due out July 2001!
So gettg diagnosed wh mono his summer wasn't the best thg that could have happened to me I got so sick of watchg television  playg computer games  sleepg I was desperate f readg material  My  younger brother had all three Harry Potter books  what wh all the  hype I picked up &quotScerer's Stone&quot  I was hooked I thk I  read all four books wh four  five days JK Rowlg remds me so much  of the Roald Dahl books I read  grade school   fact I thk she has  surpassed the great Dahl wh her eye f detail  delightful style I  became so engrossed  Harry's wld that I actually screamed out loud at  some parts of this book I can't wa f book five to come outonly 11  months to go
I disagree wh most reviewers here This book does NOT live up to the legacy set by the other three I still love Harry Potter but this book is average compared to the excellence of the others I kept askg myself  &quotWhere was the ed?&quot This book could have easily been cut   1/2  been a better read as a result Themes descriptions  events  from the previous three books were repeated here unnecessarily Scenes were  stretched out Conversations  descriptions lacked the snappy w we've  come to expect from JK Rowlg An issue of slavery was troduced poly   then dropped whout resolution The only new &amp excg part of  Harry Potter Book IV was the end It's not easy to keep a long book series  igal JK Rowlg is very talented but  turns out she's human too  While the first 3 books  the series are masterpieces book 4 is simply  average Let's hope she regas the &quotmagic&quot wh the rest of the  series If not I'll wa to read her wrg aga when she begs a new  sty - outside of the wld of Harry Potter
Don't let the hype turn you off This is a magnicent addion to the Harry Potter series -- full of magic  hum  memable characters  adventure As you've no doubt heard this IS a darker book than the  previous three but  is still filled wh fun as well Too much has been  made  the press of &quotHarry discovers girls&quot  &quota  character dies&quot These are not the maj focus of the bookDon't  let the hype cause you to jump to the Harry Potter series here Book 4 is  NOT the place to beg AND you don't want to deprive yourself of the  enjoyment of the whole seriesI'm preparg to read this one aga  befe I let my husb read  -- I want to sav the adventure  agaNow the only problem is wag f Book 5! But  this book is  any dication  too will be wth the wa
I thought this book was great  would reccomend to anyone!  By far one of the  not the best of the series Harry Potter!  It makes me depressed when i fish the book because i want to keep knowg what happens I hope  JK Rowlg will conte wrg!  Thank you!
Another perfect sce f JK Rowlg  Well  It was wth the wa  Harry Potter is back at his &quotmischevious&quot ways  But is someone out to kill Harry aga?  Harry Ron  Hermione are officially teenagers  now  They've fally started to notice people from the oppose gender  But are they  love wh the right people?  Harry's le seems to take a  turn f the wst after his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire  Nobody  will beleive that Harry didn't enter himself to the TriWizard Tournament  Not even Ron beleives him which gets them to a very long quarrel  But  some of the people that are very well liked by dferent readers are  dieg  One of whom is vastly over rated  Not that I don't like them of  course  If your thkg about readg  you really should  Don't get  left behd  Follow the trend  read   you'll deffetaly get left  out
I am a 43 year old mother of an 8 year old boy  we LOVE Harry Potter  We got the first book at Christmas  as soon as  was fished we dered the second  Half-way through the second we dered the third  book  And as soon as  was possible we pre-dered the then untled  book 4  And each time we have not been disappoted My son can   does read que well on his own but Harry Potter brgs us back together  snuggled on the couch while I read aloud dog all the voices  It is a  lot of fun especially as Ms Rowlg wres wh such detail that the  wds just seem to read themselves  the voices take shape all on their  own This fourth book is much me tense  darker than the first  three  I kept pausg durg some of the scenes to be sure my son  wasn't too frightened  He would just say &quotI'm fekeep  readg! &quot  And I would The fact that Harry  his friends are  growg up is wonderful however I hope Ms Rowlg doesn't lose to many  of her younger fans by makg them grow too fast  The tesy hmonally   well as wizardly could be much wse f the younger kids  that  would be too bad But I wouldn't trade Harry Potter f anythg as   brought my son &amp I back together on the couch over a good book LONG  LIVE HARRY POTTER!
They just get better  better The first book was an amazg new trend that popped up out of nowhere  surprised us all It carried us to the whole wld of Harry Potter The second book was better  longer(does a happy dance) The plot thickened  you couldnt wa f me The third book was just soo amazg that I didn't thk she could keep  up The new characters I mean who couldn't love dearest Padfoot  Moony (I awa their  at least Moony as Padfoot is  the fourth book wh ltle patience)  Then I read the fourth book O MY GOD The way  runs 's like  wasn't wrten rather as   has actually occured As dferent events roll by I found myself jumpg up  down screamg wh delight  terr laughg hysterically  me By the time the last book comes out I'll be a juni(probably  she publishes a book a year) But you know what? I know that I'll still be readg about the adventures of dear Harry Potter  lovg A small PS- Many have compared Rowlg's wk to that of Tolkien  I read The Hobb  The Ld of the Rgs many years ago  aded that as well  There is ltle reason to say which is better as they are both fantastic wks  Neher are high lerature but neher should be disregarded by any means eher
I am just amazed at JK Rowlg's contually awesome imagation  I was hopg after countg down the days from when I predered   February that I wouldn't be disappoted from hypg myself up too much I should  have known all along that the book would be as entertag  magical as  the first three  Harry starts to do a lot of growg up  this book  I  wish the series had come out when I was at a similar age as Harry because  I thk that Ms Rowlg has a wonderful knack at ptrayg the trials of  early adolescence  classmate rivalry  But the most imptant pot is  that one doesn't have to be a young adult to love the books I fd myself  callg mean people 'muggles' place of less nice phrases  wishg  that I could use Summong Charms when I am too lazy to get off the couch  to get a rgg phone I can't give enough stars to these books  can't  wa f the fth book!
The latest stallment of the adventures of the boy-wizard at Hogwarts will not disappot the legions of Potter fans    All of Rowlg's imagative  telligent school kids are back  fill the book's 700+  pages wh me of the rapid paced twisty-turny plot that is the hallmark  of this series    While no spoilers here some surprises awa the reader  as among other thgs Harry discovers girls   The suation of course is  hled deftly wh great w  hum as we expect from the auth    Conversely this one is a tad darker  tone than the previous three  a  death  s effects on those who survive is very realistically ptrayed  frankly these only add to the vivid realism to be found throughout these  magical fantasies    After the sty's climax the explanations go on a  b too long befe the book actually ends but this a m cricism   the endg is well wth the wa   Any auth who can get kids to read a  700-page tome certaly has this librarian's respect  admiration  The  whole series is highly recommended f everyone who enjoys a rousgly  gr read
Wow! I don't even know where to beg I am not gog to give you a summary because you have to read this book from cover to cover by yourselves What happened was I first bought the second book first   could not even put  down As soon as I fished I quickly dered the  1st 3rd  4th books I could not even fall asleep when I didn't fish  a book because I was to eager to wake up  the mng  start aga  Ever sce I five years old I always loved books about magic  creatures  These books have all of that From the time Harry is troduced to the time  he discovers he is a wizard to the time he discovers that his evil  nemisis who killed Harry's parents is gettg his power back ALL of  is  just great I higly recommend all four of these books  i can't wa f  the next one
My son has severe dyslexia  He does not like to read but  the book is Harry Potter he will try to read  I enjoy listeng to him giggle as he reads  Harry Potter is wkg his magic  showg my son how much fun   is to read Grs
My father bought my son the 1st Harry Potter book f Christmas because of the hype  I bought him 2-4 because we're hooked  Together my 9 yr old  I read the books after homewk is done (I'm proud to say that they  have surpassed Pokemon  the &quotthg I have to hear about f hours on  end&quot categy) I am delighted to see my son's attachment to the  characters  We discuss everythg about the book  great detail  cludg the Dursley's po treatment of Harry  what we might do wh  an visibily cloak!  The characters have enough dimension to them to  keep you hangg on every wd  JK Rowlg is to be commended on her  gt of imagery  her abily to communicate real emotion  human (er  muggle) behavi  In fact I'm embarrased to say that while sufferg from  somnia the other night I wanted to read the end of the chapter my son   I  were on  befe I knew  I'd fished the book!
I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WITH LITTLE CHILDREN IT COULD WARP THEIR FRAGILE EASILY-MANIPULATED MINDS AND SCAR THEM FOR LIFE WITH A FALSE VIEW OF REALITY
As a 15 year old reader this book seems to me just the type of book our society would embrace  It resembles an above average action movie- just s down relax  put your bra on autopilot  pretty soon you're  done  you've achieved a superficial satisfaction wh predictable  plots bg uncomplicated characters  enough gizmos  special  effects however predictable to make you feel that the book achieved some  kd of ventiveness  Endearg characters!  How?  To be endearg  characters must have flaws- somethg to sympathize wh!  Do these  characters have flaws  can they even be described usg me than 2  dferent adjectives each?  The good characters are good kd   selfless  Any mistake is eher not their fault  easily fgiven- few  consequences  The bad characters are &quotbad to the bone&quot- be   the family- (believable?  Or just another bl twist on the evil  stepsisters/stepmother/Roald Dahl-esque family  'Matilda' premise?) -   the bully Malfroy  Can't he possess any endearg tras?  Most bullies  possess some redeemg qualies  at least are a victim  some way  themselves  The types of magic used  these sties are also  unremarkable  Spells enchanted objects cantationshow mundane  And  used to excess  Cheep thrills  the long = better mentaly add up to  the Harry Potter mania  I wouldn't be so scathgly negative    weren't f the Harry Potter series' populary  They are *somewhat*  entertag but meanwhile people are ravg that these are THE greatest  books ever  at least close  People thk that no other children's  fantasy comes close  That is a monsterous misconseption!  When a younger  reader I read tons of children's fantasy  True proven novative  classics do exist  Just look at Tolkien's 'Ld of the Rgs'  'The  Hobb' Peter Beagle's 'The Lost Unicn' 'The Phantom Tollbooth' C S  Lewis' 'The Chronicals of Narnia' wonderfully funny Roald Dahl Susan  Cooper's 'The Dark is Risg' sequence Lloyd Alexer's 'The Prydan  Chronicles' John Bellairs' fun darkish fantasy/mysteries Phillip  Pullman's still unfoldg greatly promisg 'His Dark Materials' series  Diana Wynne Jones' marvelously twisted genious funny books Madele  L'Engle's fabulous 'A Wrkle  Time' ( sequels)- among thouss of  other tles  All of the above are wonderful novative deceptively  simple ( some cases)  unfgettably unique books all wthy of  multiple re-readgs  To Harry Potter like a mediocre action movie I  will only give one screeng  The question is not whether the above books  have a pletha of mers but whether you will read some  wade to  deeper waters than lightly enjoyable Harry Potter booksfunny Roald Dahl Susan  Cooper's 'The Dark is Risg' sequence Lloyd Alexer's 'The Prydan  Chronicles' John Bellairs' fun darkish fantasy/mysteries Phillip  Pullman's still unfoldg greatly promisg 'His Dark Materials' series  Diana Wynne Jones' marvelously twisted genious funny books Madele  L'Engle's fabulous 'A Wrkle  Time' ( sequels)- among thouss of  other tles  All of the above are wonderful novative deceptively  simple ( some cases)  unfgettably unique books all wthy of  multiple re-readgs  To Harry Potter like a mediocre action movie I  will only give one screeng  The question is not whether the above books  have a pletha of mers but whether you will read some  wade to  deeper waters than lightly enjoyable Harry Potter books
As father of 4 children I had to wa  a queue to read any of JK Rowlg's &quotPotter&quot sties  It was well wth the wa! The Goblet of Fire is certaly &quotdarker&quot than the previous offergs   perhaps me dficult to read f smaller children (Me are 7 &amp  8) but  grips you from cover to cover   you can prise  from  their small hs  is a &quotmust read&quot
First of all I have to say that I loved this book It was just asimagative as the first three maybe even me so I loved the newcharacters as well as the contuation of others especially Dobby the House Elf However I have to wonder what will happen to the series once the media is through wh The only advice I have is f you to read the book don't see the movie refuse to buy the upcomg Harry Potter umbrellas contue to be amazed by JK Rowlg's wonderful wrg style  get on wh your le
Harry Potter fans will love Book 4  The sty has a lot of twist  turns to keep you gog through the 734 pages  Wh new characters  many excg adventures this book is a must read  My son  I are  readg the series together  we love 
I loved this book!  It was by far the best Harry Potter yet It really isn't that long f you who are freaked about readg a 734 page book I read   about 4 days You can't stop readg  The irony at the end of  the sty makes  even better So I recommend you read this book IT'S  GREAT!
I stood  le outside of a bookste at midnight the very first mute of July 8 2000  I was there f the new release of &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  I was determed to get my hs on a copy   At the age of 18 I looked very out of place stg amongst the 7  8  year olds  their parents but my sister 15  I are avid Harry Potter  fans  We ran home each clutchg our VERY own copy of the book  read  until we both fell asleep at 3 am  This book is my fave of the  first four  It is emotional well wrten excg  a non-stop read   I read the entire book from start to fish  27 hours  that cluded  one 4-hour night of sleep  beg fced to tape X-Files  It does not  matter what age you are these books are not exclusively f children  My  father who is close to 50 stood  le f a copy!  The characters  are complex  very real  The hum is wonderful  the details make  everythg seem as   is floatg  front of you as you read through  the pages of the novel  You feel along wh Harry his joy frustration  fear  srow throughout the entire book  Thgs are explaed from  previous years  new fmation is revealed  The endg leaves  questions to be answered  the last three books  This book defately  made me THINK durg the readg  when I fished   I cannot wa  f book five  I will GUARANTEE you that I will st outside of ANY  bookste at ANY hour f another dose of Harry Potter
This is the best one of the series! The end is soooooooooooo creepy And po CedricI really liked him WOW! This book is amazg! If you haven't read  you must I was fished by the 9th that's how much I  liked  (I guess you all know  came out on the 8th!) And I didn't even  go to one of those midnight bookste parties I heard an terview w/ JKR   she said that &quotthis is just the begng of the deaths&quot Oh  noo! :-) I hope Harry  Cho end up gettg together
This is the best book of the 4  Except maybe f the 3rd one I don't know but 's really good Whoever you are you should defately read !  But I thk that Harry looks like a girl on the cover anyway 's  really good Sirius is the best character especially when he's a dog!  Oh  well Bye bye!
Fantastico!  This scrumptious novel carried a certa &quotcharm&quot to  that made  impossible to put down!  I am an 8th grader  my high school brothers  I had que an argument on who would get to read   first  an all-imptant &quotpaper-rock-scisss&quot tournament was  iated  I won!  Although there was a lack of the spt  &quotQuidch&quot the book was easily as good as the first three   not better  I thoughly enjoyed stg  my hammock  slowly  absbg the magic of this book  spe of my brother's nagggs to  &quotread  faster!&quot
What else can anyone say?  Except BRRRILLIANT!  All of JK Rowlg's Books are fantastic but I would say HP Book 4 is the best  the wld  I have heard that the fact is that Book 4 is the wld's most fastest  seller!  Wag f Book 5!
 The best HP book yet the Goblet of Fire troduces new characters such as the ex-aur Mad-Eye Moody who takes up the Defence agast the Dark Arts job  the hrible Daily Prophet repter Ra Skeeter  The book is based on a mysterious event at Hogwarts that hasn't happened  over a hundred years  alas Ld Voldemt Wh JK Rowlg's usual twist of zany hum rich descriptions  a surprise endg &quotThe Begng&quot 's no wonder this book has leapt to the best seller listve knowen aboutHARRY POTTER ROCKS!ome even closer friends  Here's to book 5!t f number five to come I want to see what Voldemt will do wh power  Goblet of Fire is the most wonderful breathtakg upsettg book yetese hrible people?  Harry ultimately recognizes the fallacy  such behavi I just hope that the kids readg this book will be able to underst just as wellikely grow  wisdom  comprehension And he will not be alone  that path  this book the figures of Ron Hermione Dumblede Hagrid  so many others become me fundamental  close  Harry is not a solary hero he is  fact the center of a communy full of ethical values frienship  heart-warmg solidary A wld confronted wh evils that are somehow the mirr image of some troubles on our day to day wldThe reader of all ages will fd material f fun  though on this book a classic on s own beyond any lerary cricof the readg audience It was nice to see less of the Dursleys the Muggle family who raised Harry because they were rather one-dimensional  predictable Profess Dumblede's role becomes me  me clear as do the roles of some of the other Professs However there is a b of fat  the sty that could be cut A sub-plot volvg house-elves never really generated steam The polical crectness of  felt a b out of place The Quiddch action here isn't que as captivatg as  was  Prisoner of Azkaban  In the end a very satisfyg read though  took about twice as long Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire answers que a few questions but poses so many me It is a ftg midpot f the series  dutully sets up the remag 3 (accdg to Rowlg) books  It wks along the same les as a certa episode  the Star Wars series  However I would not recommend jumpg straight to Goblet of Fire whout readg the first 3 books as readers of the entire will be richly rewarded wh the various references  nods  GoFaban  In the end a very satisfyg read though  took about twice as long Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire answers que a few questions but poses so many me It is a ftg midpot f the series  dutully sets up the remag 3 (accdg to Rowlg) books  It wks along the same les as a certa episode  the Star Wars series  However I would not recommend jumpg straight to Goblet of Fire whout readg the first 3 books as readers of the entire will be richly rewarded wh the various references  nods  GoF
I received the newest Harry Potter  the mail the day befe my vacation  took  along to read  Never read  on the trip but spotted lots of Harry Potter fans readg this  the other books  Read  fally found   to be pretty good but a ltle bg  spots  Also  is much darker  than the first three books  the endg sets us up f a dark  gloomy  sequel  I don't know  I like that but I supposed I'll contue to read  the books anyway
Harry Potter 4 is out  the best so far!  I would say that  Harry Potter 4 was 1/2 as good as 3  would be fab!  While JK Rowlg is addg  some great thrillg  'cool' parts she is still wrg about  everythg a 14 year old boy would go though a crush fights  anythg  else you could ever image  Have you not read Harry Potter  the Goblet  of Fire yet?  Do so now!  Have you not read any Harry Potter books  that  is possible?  Then start readg! You will never want to put down this 734  paged book!  (you might miss a good part)  Well this thriller/comedy is  full of great parts  You'll love   I started readg Harry Potter 4 the  mute I got !  What me can I say?  This bok is fabulous great the  best number 1!  Is Harry gog to go to the ball wh his big crush will  he be fced to see the wst?  Fd out now!  Go to your nearest  bookste  just by  off the net pay any price!  Is  he-who-must-not-be-named really back?  There's a new repter  town who  might just tear apart people's self esteem!  Now hurry  buy this book  befe I s here f hours just typeg away  tell you the whole book!  But no one would ever be able to desribe Harry's adventures as well as  JK Rowlg did!  GO HARRY!
Ever sce I started readg harry potter  really seemed as  my wld got a ltle b brighter  I have never enjoyed a book this much sce I've read &quotThe Mist of Avalon&quot  &quotThe Chronicles of  Narnia&quot  The series just get better  better  I just could not  put the book down while I was readg  (When I first got hold of the much  waed book 4 I was readg  to the wee hours of mng) I thk why  I enjoyed the book so much is because by this time the characters have  grown on you  They're not just some made-up heroes anyme they are your  friends  somehow you st of feel what they're gog through  Of  course amid the familiar settgs  personalies Rowlg adroly  troduces new people twists  secrets  But don't fret the same wry  hum is very much still there F those of you who haven't bought the  fourth book yet ( *gasp* books 1-3) you're missg somethg BIG  And  's not just hype eher  (I've got a sister who dislike readg  yet  I got her to read AND enjoy the book) So BRAVA JK Rowlg! We cannot  wa f the last 3 stallments of Harry Potter
I have mixed feelgs about this book Overall  is very well wrten  will appeal to both children  adults It follows the classic Harry Potter fmula of magical mystery I should have known by now that the  &quotbad guy&quot is never who  seems to be Many characters return  from the previous books cludg Moang Myrtle  Dobby who were  mysteriously absent from Book 3 As any Harry Potter fan would expect you  get treated to a shockg &quotrevelation&quot near the end that explas  all the mysteriesI have a ty b of negative pots to express First  of all  is very tirg to hear about what happened  the past 3 books  The first hundred pages are full of stuff like this so that people who  haven't read the previous books can catch up You absolutely must have read  the past 3 books befe readg this one I warn you now The length of the  book is a good pot The goodness lasts longer   feels truely epic  The previous 3 books now seem small  comparison The climax of the book  when Harry meets wh You-Know-Who himself is truely excg  erases  any negative feelgs you may have had befeIn my opion the Goblet  of Fire is the second best book of the series (behd the Prisoner of  Azkaban) It's an absolute must-read f every human on earth It's the  &quotStar Wars&quot of books  no one whould miss out
As an adult I wanted to see what all the hype was about I'm glad that I found out The Potter books are excellent The fourth book is much darker than the other three but I thk  reflects how le changes as Harry gets  older The book may not be suable f children under ne sce some of  the suations may be frighteng Rowlg weaves a wonderful tale  one  really hates to leave Hogwarts at the end of each book Wag f Vol 5  eagerly I listened to the 4th one on audio  is excellent atmospheric   made me s  my car to catch just a few me mutes 
This book held my attention right to the very end!  Yes I know tons of people say that about books but wh this on  is soooooo true! I will try to tell you somethgs but I don't want to give  awayAlso this book is so much better  you have read the other Harry Potter books First of all  after Harry spent another hrible summer wh the Dursley's but this year   is better because first of all Dudley is on a DIET secondly Harry gets  to go to The Quiddch Wld cup ( Quiddch is a game played on broom  sticks) Back at hogwarts ( a school f young wches  wizards) we get  a new defense agianst the black arts teacher &quotmadeye&quot moody  also there is a new thig gog on at hogwarts  is called a Triwizard  Tournament! Now that is all I am gog to tell you anythg else except (  he who must not be named) hope this was helpful!
This is the first time I have read any of the Harry Potter series  I am hooked  I read book 4 first but found  easy to follow what had happened  could easily guess  have started searchg f books 1 through 3  I'm so glad I took the chance to see what all the &quothype&quot was  It  was well wth   look fward to readg all of the others whether  they already be out  prt of those to come  Way to go!
JK Rowlg has done  aga Once aga she has gripped my imagation wh a book I thought that she might have overdone  this time ( is 700 pages long) but I found  an excellent book It was a b long   meered on f a b but  was varied  funny when  did Great  book
AT A SCHOOL BOOKFAIR I FIRST SAW HARRY POTTER AND THOUGHT IT WAS A RIDICULAS BOOK BUT THEN I HEARD GREAT REVEIWS ABOUT IT (THIS WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO) AND I DECIDED TO READ IT AND FOUND OUT IT WAS AMAZING!I HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING LIKE IT BUT SAME WHITH BOOKS 2AND3 BOTH WERE BETTER  THEN THE LAST BUT HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE WAS BETTER THAN ALL  THREE PUT TOGETHER AND THAT WILL PROBLEY BE THE SAME WITH 5 6 AND 7 BUT I  RECAMEND THE SERIES TO ANYONE!
The long wa was wth  This book is excellent  I'm glad thebook was so long because  was wonderful knowg that there wasstill a way to go befe I was fished Rowlg is at her descriptivebest She troduces us to other wizardg schools makes us thk about the rights of house-elves who seem to be happy wh no rights whatsoever  the first ball at Hogwarts Harry Ron  Hermione are gog through the evable adolescent blues Harry has a crush Cho who likes Cedric Ron is jealous of Harry as he feels Harry always is  the limelight while he has to be content beg only Harry's friend  Hermione is the apple of a famous Quiddch plyer's eye We wonder whether Ron  Hermione will ever date each other At the same time Voldemt is becomg me powerfulRowlg's style has dicreetly become me mature to su the the age of the characters of her book This book has a me universal appeal  older children will defely read I can't wa f the next book
The Goblet of Fire was the best book of the books yet  I recomend  f all ages I was a ltle over whelmed wh the size of  but as soon as you get to   is great!
Have you noticed that  this series the second book was better then the first  the third was better then the first two? I was wried that the fourth book wouldn't que follow the tradion (I mean 700 PAGES) but  boy was I wrong This is the best one  the series J K Rowlg has kept  me on the edge of my chair from the first chapter (a VERY good hooker) to  the last sentence ( isn't que a clf hanger endg - s me like he  fell off the clf then led safely on a ledge)
I adm that I started readg to see what all the hype was about But after readg the first two I decided to buy all four I thought that all of the Harry Potter books were very imagative  fun JK Rowlg  weaves a sty about a magical place that I'm sure the readers would like  to vis I know that I would have loved the series as a child The best  part is seeg all of the children readg aga As I was recently walkg  to our vets carryg a Harry Potter book I heard an exced child  whisperg to his Mother that I had the book It was very cute
I thk this book deserves 20 stars! I've not enjoyed a book like this f a very long long time Readg  remds me of the first time I ever laid my h on a book Those who don't like this book should turn  their  membership to the human race!
Book 4 is terric---wh all the elements that made 1-3 so popular 's sure to delight Harry Potter fans no matter what their ages (I happen to be 30  my 40 year old brother is a fan too)! As far as the length of  the book is concerned I didn't notice  at all I breezed through the  book quickly (neglectg my required readg f college classes) am  ready to reread the whole series aga Congrats to Ms Rowlg f another  wonderful read I can't wa f #5
This is a book f 9-year-old kids?  I thk not! Murder violence  me murder even a son killg his father? How sad that the auth had to turn to the violence to sell her sty stead of stickg wh great  imagation  fun
I really enjoy the books  this series   almost seems as though JK Rowlg couldn't wre a bad book  I stayed up late to go out to buy the book  had to immediately start readg   I fished   less than  10 hrs (despe havg to pursue the actives of everyday le)  am now  readg  chapter by chapter to my daughter aged 7  She is really  enjoyg  too!  I LOVED !
I am a juni  high school  read the first Harry Potter book at the request of a relative  I was immediately entralled by the book's mesmerizg sty  Unlike many of the books I read now f school  even f my own enjoyment Harry Potter was light  a delicious treat f  my readg senses  Each book is better than the last darg the reader to  enter Harry Potter's wld  I was almost overwhelmed by the size of The  Goblet of Fire but found  to be a book I could not put down  This book  can be an enjoyment f any age as somethg credibly fresh  excg  I give  my highest reccomendation
I should have known Now that I have fished HP4 I can`t slep anyme Nmally I`m not the tremblg st of person but (specially) the last chapters put me  an awsome kd of mood  I don`t thk this is  a book suable f children as  wasn`t quiet suable f me eher   I`m a lot older than 10 Although this book put a spell on me like the  others haven`t (I didn`t cry readg Potter 1-3) I was shocked by the  tense atmosphere of fright spreadg from the book And I should have  known this: Fishg number 4 would leave me starvg f me addictedly  longg to know wether everythg`s gog to be all right  the end  Great bok though
My 14 yr old son  I waed all year f the release of this new book   was well wth the wa! I must warn readers of the the fact that there are three uses of the wd damn  one use of the phrase &quotWhat  the hell&quot but they were all well wh the context of the wrg   were not at all offensive I don't underst what all the brouhaha is  about these books beg  any way demonic  referrg to the occult  That's all a bunch of Hogwarts  you ask me
JK Rowlg just seems to get better  every book! wh Harry's romantic adventure begng as well as his adventure wh the Goblet of Fire 's a book you want to get Hermione is busy wh schoolwk as always but   this book she  is cooler than ever Ron starts havg Less family troubles  though their money is still a problem you fally get to meet Charlie   Bill Weasley And of course Voldemt is back  See you at the  Quidch Wld cup!   have Fun!
When I started this book I was wried that  would not be very adventurous like the last three books But WAS I WRONG Wh the Triwizard Tournament the Quiddch wld Cup  most of all Voldemt's  return  was about all the adventure that I could hle! I hope that  everyone that reads  enjoys  as much as I did
After Prisoner of Azkaban I thought JK Rowlg would have reached her peak Wrong! Goblet of Fire is easily the most creative  enjoyable book of the bunch The characters are me developed  new  fascatg  dividuals are troduced (eg Alast &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody) The  chapters concerng &quotHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot might be scary f  younger children so take caution I'm an adult fan of Harry Potter books   I can't get enough of them I'm anxiously awag the next  stallment:)
This book is not que as satisfyg as books 1 2  3 (I thought 2 better than 1  3 better than 2) This is f three reasons  Most imptantly the 20 pages  which the book reaches s climax is gog to  frighten the younger members of the ce audience  It's like a Stephen  Kg novel f those 20 pages  Addionally I found the first 150 pages   so annoyg because although I suppose necessary they delayed the  characters from gettg to Hogswart's  Fally be warned this book  doesn't come to a satisfacty conclusion like the first 3 -- thgs are  left very much &quot progress&quot
I just fished Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire last night  was mesmerized through all 734 pages of !  My niece Gail Dnenburg who turned me on to the Harry Potter series  August 1999 fished readg  the copy of Book 4 I sent her as a gt via Amazoncom the weekend  came  out -- but I've enjoyed savg this very special book these past few  weeks  I love everythg from the characters to my newly-exped  vocabulary -- believe JK Rowlg's imagation has got to be the  Eighth Wonder of the Wld!  Bravo!
I bought the complete series of Harry Potter books 2 weeks to go to check out what all the hype was about Well I've fished them all  I have to advise you that they are a simply excellent un-put-downable read! No  matter what age you are you will enjoy these books  If you ever read Enid  Blyton's Magic Faraway Tree I can assure you that these books are along  the same lesMany people have asked do you need to read all four - all  I can say to that is  you don't you'll miss out on a lot of fun   adventureHopefully JK Rowlg is wkg on number 6 as we speak -  can't wa!READ THEM!
Except f beg really really long  heavy this is the best of the Harry Potter books to date  The sty is engagg  the characters have grown from the children they were  the 1st book  Ms Rowlg's  imagation amazes me  The detail she brgs to this parallel wld is  phenomenal  I stayed up late several nights because I just could not stop  readgMy only qualm would be readg this to small children  There  are some truly terryg parts of the book (even to an adult like me)   some suations that seem to me to be appropriate f children under 10   so  My recommendation to parents would be to read ahead of your child  so that you can prepare them f some of the me dficult  scary  parts  You know your child  know what they can  cannot hle as far  as death  terr go but be cautious of just readg to a small child  As a child this book would have caused me nightmares  But wh that said  I thk wh proper parental put  encouragement any child would enjoy  the action excement friendships  lessons from this marvelous book
I have read all 4 harry potter books  their entirety  this by far is the best!  Im killg myself over the next book askg myself questions like what will  be about  who will be enterg hogwarts next  which  teacher will betray him this year i cant believe i have to wa till next  summer f the 5th:(
When I started this book I was wried that  would not be very adventurous like the last three books But WAS I WRONG Wh the Triwizard Tournament the Quiddch wld Cup  most of all Voldemt's  return  was about all the adventure that I could hle! I hope that  everyone that reads  enjoys  as much as I did
I am a 40-somethg Harry Potter fan who delights  the irresistible mix of adventure magical themes  high ideals  This book kept me readg far to the night terried at Harry's seemgly surmountable trials   cheerg the good guys  The whole series is excellent entertament  wh the Goblet of Fire the best yet  Bravo Ms Rowlg!  I can't wa to  read the next volume
J K Rowlg has once aga amazed us all wh her 4th book  The Harry Potter books have been called a phenomenon  que crectly!  If there were any doubts about Rowlg's creativy  authg abilies they hav  now been laid tpo rest as she contues to mesmerize her readers  This  year at Hogwarts is filled wh exg new ideas (that I won't give away)  that prevent her books freom becomg route  She developes her  charachters masterfully  at the end of the book you just be wantg  me  Very Excellent!
As many of the other readers I am not the typical 9yr old child readg this book I am eighteen but I still enjoyed this book as well as the others It has plot twists that most maj wrers today don't put  their books Wh great characters  an excellent plot this will keep you  turng pages till you are done
JK Rowlg's books just keep gettg better  better I am not much of a reader but I have been a Harry Potter fanatiic ever sce my mother fced me to read the first 4 chapters of &quotScerer's Stone&quot  This fourth book defetely lives up to my expectations I nmally  wouldn't touch a 752-page book but the length of  is a good thg  because there is me suspense   seems like I learned me about the  magical wld  this book than  the last two combed The book is also  very funny at times  I can relate to Harry As f those of you who say  the book is too simple  unigal maybe you're right but who cares!  This is the readg equivalent of a smooth ride on a top-of-the-le  Firebolt broom  I actually agree wh what people said about the last  few chapters that  was choppy  confusg However the rest of the  book me than makes up f that   is still a thrill I recommend  this to everybody Period
My daughter already had the first book  the series  when I heard all the excement about book 4 I asked to read  to see what all the excement was about  I read the book  decided to buy the other three  books because I got terested  I am also an elementary teacher   thought  would be a good idea to know what many children are terested    I loved the sty   is a great series of books to keep the  children's terest  The one thg that would keep me from allowg the  books  my classroom  encouragg my daughter to read them is the many  &quotbad wds&quot that are thrown   Why would a children's auth  that has this wonderful idea f lerature thk that she has to clude  these wds that many of us do not use  want our children to hear  use?  I could see no reason to clude these unnecessary wds  therefe  would not encourage any child to read the books I realize the majy of  families use this kd of language  their homes but I thk we should be  ashamed of ourselves f encouragg bad thgs when our children are  volved  (I have marked through all the &quotbad wds&quot as I was  readg  suggest that all parents at least do this befe hg the  books over to their children)
I am a 14 year old Not many thgs can keep my attention these days wh video games  tv But just give me a Harry Potter book  I'll read f hours on end While i'm readg about dragons magical spells crazy teacher  a boy named Harry Potter nothg well able to divert my  attention This book is good f all ages If any of your kids are to to  much tv buy them a Harry Potter book
This was one really great book  My brother  i had to share the book so i didnt get to fish  until the monday after  came out  I like all of the harry potter books a lot but i thk i like this one the best  It also  lasted me longer than the other books so that was better too (i read  chamber of secrets  2 hours the first time i read )  I have read the  first book 12 times the second one 6 times  the third book 7 times so i  guess u could call me a harry potter fanatic  Everythg i do is about  harry potter  I thk about him i talk about him  i dream about him  So i reccomend this book to any of the few people who havent read   already
I just fished completg by far the best novel I've ever read JK Rowlg has simply outdone herselfJust two sht weeks ago I decided that I had to discover what this &quotHarry Potter&quot craze was all  about Bombarded from every direction (eher by the media  friends  tellg me that the books &quotare amazg&quot) I just had to fd out  After readg the first book the Scer's Stone I was a Potter fanatic  I quickly fished books 2  3  got 4 about a week agoBook 4  opens unlike any of the other books which was a welcome treat Book four   a nutshell is que possibly dested to be a classic It is comparable  to any film recd patg photograph you name  It is a wk of  art Rowlg strs multiple plotles  her own magical creations  together to create a wonderful confection that could not simply be referred  to as a &quotchildren's book&quot (actually that would be an sult)  Yes this book is filled wh thgs that children will love--unfgettable  characters lots of magic  a great sty However adults will  appreciate all of these thgs as well  will get an extra treat: they  will also be able to appreciate the sly hum the tense imagery  the  many allusions to histy  pop culture that children may not  understI recommend that befe you buy this book READ ALL OF THE  OTHERS Though you can theetically just pick up book four  start  readg (Rowlg gives a wealth of backsty) you would really be dog  yourself an justice There is so much that happened befe this sty  don't read the other three  you will miss out on the emotional jolts  that this book gives numerous times And another warng: don't read this  book unless you are fully aware that you will be physically mentally   socially attached to  until you fish!
I read Harry Potter  about 13 hours of solid readg   was the best one yet I could not take my eyes off  Buy  now curl up  a chair  read !
OK fe Maybe because I'm 14 means that readg children's books isn't socially acceptable Well tough As a loyal Harry reader I was a tad wried that maybe this bookwouldn't live up to the stards of the past  3WRONG! In Book 4 the excement never stops as JK Rowlg goes f an  even twistier plot than &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot Harry is chosen to  participate  a Triwizard Tournament wh young socerers from Durmtrang   Beauxbatons other magical schools The tasks can be deadly the  competion fierce  of course beg Harry Potter means that simply  livg is reason to be nervousNothg is que what is seems when you  reach the action packed conclusion which unlike past Harry books leaves  ends hangg f the next book  the seriesNaturally all your  fave characters are back:Ron Hermione the Weasely tws Hagrid  Dumblede(obviously) Snape  happily Sirius BlackBut there are  plenty of new faces like &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody the new Dark Arts  teacher who gives new defion to the wd paranoid You won't believe  how thgs turn out so get readg!
Potter 4 comes on a wave of such publicy  media hype that one cannot help but be a ltle cynical about the series mers I havg read the other 3 was hopg this to be as enchantg as the rest  I was not  dissapoted Despe wieghg  at over 600 pages (It is too long) I was  constantly enthralled throughout the sty Although rowlg is not an  credibly gted wrer she is a very good styteller An excellent  book
This book is great I could hardly put  down  From start to fsh you know you are  f the time of your le  The fight between Voldermont  Harry was awesome  After your done readg this book you will know how  I feel
I am what you could call a Harry Potter Child I read the first Harry Potter when I was eleven I am now fourteen One thg I noticed about this  series that as me people need me stimulation  the books they are  gettg darker Me people die Harry experiences scarier thgs Really  as Harry gets older his audience gets older What is ltle Harry Potter  gog to see when he is seventeen? How me terrible can they get? Other  than that I found the endg a ltle unsatisfacty as always JK  Rowlg has managed to leave multiple questions hangg  mid-air  screamg READ THE NEXT BOOK I thought Hermione was changg somehow wh  her um romance wh Krum the Quiddch Champion Seeker I really liked  the book though don't misunderst JK msut have that val mixture of  hum  excement Only I wish the carefree Harry Potter would return  Slowly he is beg replace by a tmented teenager full of troubles   hidg from murderers nearly consistantly  These books need me joy
Harry Potter used to be unknown to me That is befe my last birthday I read all three books  a total of two days  I craved me When I heard  that a fourth book was comg out I went to a book release party at the  local book ste thkg that  had better be wth  It is Although  long  greulg  fascates your every fantasy My fave chapter  Prii Incantem topped all three of the previous books put together I  recommend this book but I advise that the first three be read first They  aren't necessary but they tie up many loose ends Happy Readg!  :)
I got the book  the first week  read  wh two days  After I fished the book I read  aga  Though I have read many great books the Harry Potter books are my faves ever  The fourth book is just as  good ( not better) than the others Though the book goes semi- slowly  until Harry gets to Hogwarts the books still seems far less than s 734  pages because 's so terestg  I'm not gog to say anythg about the  plot but f any Harry Potter fans just pick up the book  read  now!  I can't wa f the 5th one
I am so tired of hearg how this book  all of the other Potter books are classics--they are not classics--classics all have the earmark of a  strong ethical message which every one of these books lack  Meover the  character development is nonexistent  What do I mean by that?  A well  developed character is one that has depth that shows many often  contradicty tras--like a REAL human beg  Look at Draco Malfoy look  at Hermony Grager--when do they ever show any dferentiation from the  characters they were igally ptrayed as--NEVER!  Do not mention these  books  the same breath as Lewis  Tolke--they bear absolutely no  resemblance As f the fact that so many people love them--there's no  accountg f taste  These books have yet to w any awards f  children's lerature  f fantasy  science fiction lerature  AND  THEY WON'T!  The first book is great because  gets kids readg but  the fourth is just me of the same--so bgour culture has reached a  sad state of affairswhy don't we eat McDonald's every night  call  the Potter books classics?
Although I was wried after readg the first three books that this edion would not measure up I was very impressed! 700 pages seemed like none as I was pulled throught the sty This book was far me emotional   had much me depth than the other three It did not conta the simple  magic the first book had but Harry Potter is growg up  the books are  growg up wh him The details contued to come together  make  rereadg the first three books even me fun!
In a spectacular blend of fantasy  hum JKR has done  yet aga  Harry Potter appeals to all ages alike  His courage  his friends make way f a gr adventure  The most strikg part of Harry Potter is JKR's  abily to talk about very adult themes such as death  a children's  book  Harry Potter is much me than a children's book though  Never  befe have wds come alive off the page  danced like a movie  Never  has the enjoyment level been so high on a second readg  Never has any  novel come close to the power  fun of Harry Potter
I have read many books  few are as engagg  memable as the Harry Potter novels  I have thoughly enjoyed the series  feel that the sties just keep gettg better  better!  2500+ reviews  a 5 star  average - can we all be wrong?  No!
I am a book wm  the hype surroundg the Goblet of Fire release was gettg to me I thought of this question &quotWhy is everyone crazy about this book both children  ADULTS  this is a children's  book?&quot I decided to brow a paperback copy of The Scerer's Stone  from a friend  sure enough I got so hooked  the book that I fished   so quickly  was cravg f me so I dered all four books on  AmazonI have read the first three books so far  am begng to  read the Goblet of Fire  I am very sure that  will not disappot me  I am an adult  I can fully underst the hype behd Harry Potter   surely will be a part of the hype that will surround the fth book  the  series JK Rowlg keep up the good wk your imagation spurs me   I look fward to the next book! It will be a challenge on my patience  threshold as I awa the fth book  the HARRY POTTER series!
JK Rowlg did  aga wh book #4 Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Harry Ron  Hermione are back wh br new fun  excg( sometimes scary) adventures  I strongly recommend this book  to any one who is lookg f a good read  The book starts out kd of  slow  f the 4th book you have no idea what they're talkg about  But  the book gets up to speed very quickly  you're right there next to Harry  wh the Dursleys on the tra  Quiddch at Hogwarts   all of  his adventures  If you haven't you might want to read the first 3 books  befe you start this one  Jo Harry Ron  Hermione  READ THIS  BOOK!
I recieved this book the day  was released from Amazon  I did not put  down The book was enmous  I could not image that Harry could  have so much happen to him  his fourth year I managed to read this 700+  page book  7 days  now I can not wa f the next one to come out  What a powerful movg book!  I have never enjoyed readg as much as I do  now when I read these books I have tried to get everyone that I know to  get to these books because they are the most imagative books that make  you feel like you are right there  the middle of  all I have bought  all of the books  the series  hopes that my 6 year old daughter will  read them one day Thank you so much Ms Rowlg f your wonderful  wkYou are amazg!
When I heard the new Harry Potter book was comg out I figured  would be the same as the others-excg faboulously wrten  very detailed I figured  would be the 300  so pages as the others I was completely  WRONG! This 734 paged book is WAY past excg  breathtakg! I have  never sat  front of a book like this At one part i was actually  shakg cryg  urgg myself to go on to fd out what happens next  At first I didn't want to read the book because  looked so long   monotonous Then I remembered &quotDuh 's a Harry Potter book  no  Harry Potter book yet has been  the least b bg  monotonous even    DOES look like a dictionary!&quot So I picked up the book  went  f the ride of my le!  I defatly recommend this book to anyone who is  brave to st up to a book like this!  THANKS J K ROWLING!
JK Rowlg did not disappot  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is every b as captivatg as s predecesss This 32 year old mom could not put  down  stayed up half the night to fish   I can't wa  f the fth stallment!
Harry Potter has been some of my best time that i've spent readg  has mystery  suspense   always has the reader wonderg whats next I waed f 6 months f this fourth book to come out so that I could read   a day At first I thought these books to be f my 7yr old brother  but then when I read the first one I was immediatly hooked  ended up  wrg a book rept on the first three  got 110% because I was so to  the books  could remember some of the smallest details like a characters  name  a weird wd  i just can't wa f the rest of the series to  come out so I can read about all Harry's adventures  mishaps that happen  along the way  see what happens to Hermione  Ron throughout their  years at Hogwarts These books are f young  old  you have an  imagation because these books take you on a new kd of adventure through  wchcraft  wizardry
In her latest volume of this exceptional series JK Rowlg has once aga delivered a book to delight both children  adults While very long not a wd could be cut Like each of the others this contued tale  of the adventures of a fledglg wizard is a fun-filled hum-filled  adventure-filled page turner that will hold any reader's attention through  to the end Harry contues his battle agast the evil of Ld Voldemt   contues to uphold the values of loyalty tegry honesty   fairplay well enough to make any mally-mded parent me than happy
Harry Potter rocks! The 4th book was awsome although the 3rdis still my fave  It seems that each Harry Potter book gets altle b me tense as the series goes on  this one certaly doesn't lack suspense  tensy! The endg chapters especially The one thg that surprised me a b was the swearg I have absolutely no problem wh people swearg just was strange to read the characters swearg that's all Besides that the Goblet of Fire was excellent A must read!
How can you not love a book that puns "sturm und drang" as the name of a school of magic?  Impossible!  Rowlg does this st of thg throughout the whole book  that's only one reason to ade this series  That  the action  adventure  hum  people  everythg else
I thought this book was really great I  reckon 's not que as good as the other three but I've only read  once  you pick up dferent thgs when you read  me than once I thk
Beg a Harry Potter fan I thought this book met maybe even went higher than my expectations I thk the long wa f the fourth book was defely wth    any Harry Potter fan doesn't yet have  they  should defely get  It was well-wrten  the sty is catchg  Terric book!
If you haven't read book 1 2  3 then you should do so befe readg this book All previous sties  discoveries are revealed  this book Other than the thickness of the book (hard to read  the bath tub  giggle) I LOVED IT As I do the others Will there be me? Oh this is  the first book (EVER) that I cried about (A happy cry) I love mal  fiber!
As a 3rd grade teacher I have to say that this one is a ltle me sophisticated than my students could hle but  a couple of years they'll be ready!  Iti is wonderful how Ms Rowlg has improved the sty  wh a new style that varies from the first three Harry seems much  me trustg of adults ( dogs!)  he makes choices that are not  self-destructive He is a magical boy--but he is a boy any kid can look to  as a role model f his bravery  kdness  I have watched my  students get exced over this series like I've never seen befe It is so  rewardg to see this from a book  not a video game! Way to go JK   way to go Harry!
Whoathat was the first wd that came out of my mouth after I had fished the first book These series are so amazg I got  all my friends  to  Harry Potter is a book that can capture any kid's imagation   enterta   help  grow My mom says that I should take a break from  all the readg I put to  But I can't stop myself I see the next  chapter  the begng wds  the next thg I know I'm done wh the  chapter  chg to fd out what happens nextI'm only 12 but now my  parents are hooked  their ages are  the 40's So take my wd f   read  I gave you a mute of my time now why don't you give a mute of  your time to this truly amzg book And I bet ya you'll get hooked!
I am a mother of 3  the whole family eagerly awaed this book  We were not disappoted  The plot is much darker than the first three books but  still has the wonderful theme of good over evil  The suspense kept  me readg one chapter after another until I completed the whole book   one day  Of course my family was que upset that I wouldn't divulge the  endg but  the end they enjoyed hearg  at sty time each eveng  We are on the edge of our seats wag to see what happens next I  believe that those who want to ban these books are out of le  It does  not promote evil  On the contrary  shows children makg decisions  between right  wrong  usg tools given to them by family   teachers  Keep up the great wk JK Rowlg!
F all you people out there (regardless of age) who are yet to open up a Harry Potter novel I strongly urge you to do so NOW! I was a 'non-believer'  the series  until 5 days ago I had never read a sgle  page Now  five days I have read them all What is so captivatg about  these books? They simply plunge you to another wld A wld of Muggles  Wizards  even elves  dragons All that read the books feel as   they've attended Hogwarts  experience everythg that Harry has  experiencedThis fourth novel Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  immense (734 pages) I have experience wh long novels beg a Stephen  Kg fan  know that they usually get draggy  you thk to yourself  &quotWhy couldn't they leave that part out? Did we really need to know  that?&quotIn all the long novels I've read (over 400 pages) I have  experienced that at least once durg the book This novel however is the  exception  actually the oppose You hate to see  end  now I  believe  will be tture between now  the release of the 5th  stallmentEverythg about this book is great Richly plotted wh  twists that will make  nearly impossible to fsee the endg Who the  heck said these books were predictable?About halfway through you  believe that you have  solved the mystery but then you fd that you  were SO OFF that you wonder how you could be so dumb When you fd out the  true endg you thk &quotwhy didn't I thk of that?&quotSce I  must be nearg the 1000 wd lim I'll leave you wh these last wds:  Buy the books cancel all appotments f the next week  read them  You'll fd that you'll want to do nothg else
This comment is only f those who have already read Book 4 Please do not proceed  you haven't read the book as yetMs Rowlg made a maj logical flaw when  came to solvg the first task The golden egg could  have been retrieved by the same charm that Harry used to get his broom  stick! Ms Rowlg could have crected the err by jectg special  powers to Dragons such that the charm could not be used But as  sts  this is a maj booboo!
rowlg has managed to use book four to move this series from an enjoyable enid-blyton-meets-roald-dahl school romp to a tale wh s own distctive voice  a much greater mal vision  harry potter now qualies as a  fairy tale:  a sty wh archetypal resonances that move  beyond just  beg a fun read&quotgoblet&quot is darker  better than the  others--i'm exced to read rowlgs' next stallment
Well what can I say the Harry Potter books are  a class all by themselves  I read this one over two days  never got bed  It was terestg to see how Harry  the other characters  their  relationships are changg as Harry grows up  I thk the auth managed  that very well  added depth to the characts amd made them que human  The endg was rivettg  sets the scene f a great sty  the next  book - I hope the auth can keep her wk rate up  not run out of steam  until the fal three books are wrten  Hopefull that won't be long - I  would buy the next three books right now  they were availableYou read   here first - Hilary Clton is Ld Voldemt's mum!
I am not a big readerr but the harry potter books treaaged me  when I staarted reaadg them I coould stopp  Thiis one (the foourth) is the besst off all  Nmally  takes me a week  two to fnish a book (i  procastate reaadg ) but thhiis one took me 2 hours  I couldn stopp  reaaddg
Like i said above  was entertag  funny but  wasnt as excg as some of the others  It was mostly buildg up to the end a lot of what happen didnt seem to have much meang till the end when the &quotfahful  death eater&quot spills his guts so  u liked the other potter books u  have to read this one to keep up wh them  i thk rowlg couldve cut   sht there was too much fluff  my opion but s good so read    your a potter fan
I'm somewhat embarrassed to adm that I fd these books so engrossg  As an adult  a muggle myself I haven't found myself so lost  a book sce The Ld of the Rgs  I even read the book  Scotl right   Edbough where JK wrote the book  I kept  near me  case I ran  to her on the street but alas I was disappoted  Don't be scared off  by the book's length -- the plot is fantastic  moves quickly along  I  loved the whole idea of the tri-wizard tournement  After all  Hogwarts  is the English model there must be other wizardg schools from other  parts of the wld right?  Will we meet New Zeal Indonesian  South  African wizards  the upcomg books?  The action is engrossg as always  -- there's even a potential love terest  The new characters are great  (old mad-eye moody)  We don't see much of Draco Malfoy but I have the  feelg he'll be back  Dumblede is my fave -- he brgs back  memies of Golf from The ld of the Rgs  This is a fantastic read  that all devoted fans will enjoy
These books are mediocre at best but have been put on a pedestal by the media  the populace  general  There are sooo many other better wrten young adult novels out there that 's not even funny!  JK  Rowlg should be wrg some royalty checks to the media because they  are sellg her books f her  I thk 's great that 's gettg kids  readg but try readg somethg else  This is gettg as bad as  Pokemon  that is NOT a good thg  Mediocre wrg mediocre sties
Harry Potter IV takes an amazg leap fward  complexy  tricacy compared to the first three  the series but does  a level appropriate f the targeted age level  Kids that read the Harry Potter series   especially the fth book are gettg both a great sty  a phenomenal  education  english  grammar   how to wre a sty  By makg  readg appealg to so many kids JK Rowlg has done children one of  the best favs that they will ever get  Hats off to her ( to Harry  Potter!)
I have just fished one of the most entertag books I have read  agesI must confess to beg a new convert previously wonderg what the fuss was all about While patiently wag f my local booksellers to  restock I bought  thoughly enjoyed the first three booksJoanne  Rowlg has lucidly succeeeded  brgg to le characters whose  emotions &amp experiences of boardg school le are so vividly drawn as  to remd me of my own very Muggles one sadly whout all the magic!The  sty is full of surprises  I was thoughly disappoted to get to the  last page Anyone wh a sense of adventure from age eight to eighty ( I  confess to beg firmly  the middle) will enjoy this rippg  yarnBravo!PS/ I noticed one blooper (howler) thoughTowards the  end of The Dream a missg character under discussion (Crouch) is  attributed  wh a le of conversation - Pg 503 Bloomsbury  edionApologies  this has been mentioned already as I have not read  all the reviews
Ok let me start this out like some st of AA meetg Hi my name is Mike I'm 19 I LOVE The Harry Potter series! Ever sce I picked up the first book I've been hooked to ! I was one of the ones  that couldn't wa f the 4th book That long wa f  seemed like an  eterny! Then Fally was released! I went to a book ste a couple  day after to pick  up  to my hrthey were sold out! I went   even checked 3  4 stes all sold out! A booksold out! I could not  believe ! Fally I decided to der  off amazon When I got  I read   that night I had  fished  4 days  f a lack of better wds   was amazg! I loved the idea of  beg darker me evil me  sister The sty was really good one of the best so far You don't need  to be a kid to enjoy this book  I know many of the reviews say  but  I'm gog to say  as well  you haven't read any books  the series  yet you really should You wont be disapoted
As was expected this book is beyond excellent  It is not only extremely well wrten but  is also another great addion to the oddessey  adventure of Harry Potter  If only Mark Twa had contued the oddessey  of Huckleberry Fn could this book been comparable to anythg else   lerature but sce he did not no comparison is available  Never  befe has there been such an enchantg absbg  lerate sty of  an amazg protaganist/hero that has been so fun  excg to read  about  Even as I was an English Maj  college I have never befe  experienced such an amazgly detailed terestg  well developed  character  fiction  I highly applaud JKRowlg  all her credible  gts of imagation
I wk at the public libary  my cy so Harry Potter is a HUGE deal to us right now  What I absolutely love is that these books allow me to become a child aga  relive those magical experiences  The looks on  the kids' faces that come to the library hopg there is a copy of the  latest Harry Potter book on the hold shelf f them is heartbreakg   excg at the same time  I like a lot of the reviewers felt this book  was the best so farmaly due to 's narrative  style  I cried (no  joke) at the end because I realized  was over  I would have to wa  f #5 to come out  I felt better though when I realized I could just  re-read  re-read the other books as much as I want  Thank you to JK  Rowlg f makg my ner child happy!
I tried not to hold out hope that the 4th book could top the 3rd but JK Rowlg has done  aga  This book is phenomenal I read the last 200 pages straight through  could not put  down  She is masterful at  troducg new &quotmagical concepts&quot early  the book  then  usg them later to advance the sty  I thouroughly loved this book   can't wa f the 5th!
A pivotal pot  Harry's le  whout a doubt the best of the series  Suspenseful humous  frighteng all at the same time  She surprises the reader at every turn wh new developments  Whatever you do  don't read this one first  This book is much me enjoyable  you know  everythg that has happened to Harry  his previous three years at  Hogwarts
Okay here's just my own personal lil review:Settg:  Excellent  She describes the wizardry wld wh much imagation  ventionPlot:  Complex humous  engagg  Though a lil too much emphasis  the Quidch Cup parts It felt like Rowlg was tryg to cram  every  imptant  past wizard  wch they had met  are haven't met  the  Mistry of Magic  wizardg wld  But I guess she was just tryg to  get everyone familiar aga wh the characters  somethgConclusion: Nice  lil clfhanger  surprise  Rowlg knows how to keep her readers  perfectly hookedOverall:  I would not recommend this book to someone  under ne  ten due to language  some very dark parts of the book But  f everyone over those ages GO GET IT!  Y'all love !
I thought pre-publicy this thick was reserved f rock bs  Star Wars movies  But f the first time stes opened at 12:01  people led up fa bookMe to the pot a CHILDREN's bookBut then  aga I shouldn't be surprised about that this series has broken the  rules all along:-At the time I wre this review there are already 2410  of them on this webse-It is so successful that the other publishg  companies have successfully fced the New Yk Times to create a separate  children's bestseller list so the &quotreal&quot books will have a shot  at the number one spot  (In three years that list will feature all seven  Harry books  they'll just pick three others to fill  spots 89   10)So while my family waed to go out on July 8 my silence   immovabily made clear that we were wag f my friendly local fedex  man to deliver my copy from a certa onle bookseller whose name shall go  unsaid (but just look at the top of your screen)  It arrived  three  days  change later (wh fced but tasteful breaks f wk food   personal hygiene not neccessarily  that der) I had tn through all  734 pagesWh each book I become me amazed wh Jo Rowlg's wrg  abily  The most throwaway details  earlier books reapparate later to  become imptant plot pots  I fd myself wonderg  she had   planned all along  does she simply scour the books f somethg to  use?The characters are growg  changg  The oppose genders makes  themselves known to our heroes  The wld is opened up a b-we learn  there are OTHER schools of magic  Secrets of Hagrid's past are revealed  Dumblede is once aga shown to be  a powerful fce to be reckoned wh   much like the auth herself I look at Albus  ask &quotHow much of  what gog to happen does he already have planned?

I have to say that this was the best Harry Potter book yet except f maybe &quotThe Chamber of Secrets&quot It was well-wrten  darker than the others  the seriesI liked the new characters troduced   the book (eg Bill  Charlie Weasly Bagman Crouch Karkaroff Madame  Maxime Fleur Delacour Cedric Diggy Vikt Krum Wky the House Elf  Ra Skeeter etc)  the contuation of characters from the third book  (Sirius Cho etc) They made the book me terestgThis book was  kd of depressg but still good I really liked the Triwizard  Tournament that was really cool but I missed Quiddch Still the  Tournament did a good job of makg up f Anyway read this book!  (Oh -   you thk that Neville will jo Voldemt please vote this  review as helpful)
I've heard some talk sayg the the Harry Potter books are evil  satanic because  talks about magic wches wizards ect  People that believe this are WRONG They are all good books that speak nothg of the  devil  hell Rest asure your child is not gog to jo satan's army   he  she reads this book  the other 3
A year ago my 8 year old son asked f the first book  I had to ask &quot Who is Harry Potter? &quot needless to say we purchase the first book  Hard cover   didn't get opened until this 4th of July just  befe the 4th book came out Wh all the excement surroundg book 4 I  decided to read The Scere's Stone to see f myself what was makg these  kids go crazy over a book Once I got through the first few chapters that  set the stage f what was to come I dered the next 3 books all  hard  cover f my personal Library Needless to say 4 books  2 weeks later I  can now see what the kids see  these credible books Both my 9 year old  son  I can go over the chapters  tell each what our fave parts  were Too see the sparkle  his eyes when we discuss Harry's adventures is  only the greatest feelg knowg that he has flly seen the joy   readg Thank You JK Rowlg f brgg the wonder of readg to all  these children
this is the best book  the series i got  at midnight  read  all that night i was up till 6  the mng
At the begng not so good But then  gets really good wh the Triwizard tournament  all the other schools comg to Hogwarts  is really i thk here best book yet At fist  was very bng but then as soon as Harry goes to tHogwarts  is announced that there will  be a  tournament  The best part of the book is atr the end when everythg comes  together One  thg that is f sure is that JK Rowlg left open enough plots to wre  her next three books Like Cho Chang is a big plot left open All  all  is the best  the thickest book  yet
I am sixteen years old  I am an avid reader I got hooked on Harry last summer when I ran out books to read  my neighb lent me her copies of the book I was so taken wh the books that I stayed up until two  the mng to fish the first book  the next day I would do nothg until  I had read the second book I then immediately dered the whole series  cludg the third book from the UK The fourth book is defely JK  Rowlg's best wk It is vivd  captures the imagation of the  readers Many people compla about the length of the book but that is the  best part of the book The book is so long that you learn so much about the  characters that  is understood why Neville is so afraid The charcters  become real  you can see their personalies me than  any other  book Some people compla that the wrg is mediocre but honestly who  cares The book is no Ulysses but no one was ever claimg  was The book  is so charmg because of that reason The book is pure fun   is a  relief to read after many deep  malistic novels Any cricism that  comes from readg this book is from people who over-analyzed this book To  fully enjoy the Harry Potter series do not analyze the books at all just  be content wh them the way they are
I love all the Harry Potter books ( fact they are my fave books)  this one is the best so far It is funny scary  sad You won't be able to put  down (i should know I fished  after readg f 9 hours  straight until 2  the mng) It kept me on the edge of my seat the  whole time I was readg  JK Rowlg really brought out the characters   this book- the old (Harry Ron Hermione their school friends)  the  new (Ra Skeeter  Vikt Krum to name a couple) There is a death   this would make  scary f ltle kids (I almost cried but then was  jumpg up as the next event took place) Well I'd give away the plot  I  talked any longer so I have one me thg to say- BUY THIS BOOK! (  read - aga  aga  agaI've read  twice so far)
The fourth Harry Potter book was every b as good as the first three  defely left me wantg me Other fans of the series who feel that they will starve until next summer  whenever the next book is released  should absolutely try out the Vertigo comic book series The Books of Magic  created by Neil Gaiman the wld-famous wrer of the Sman This  magnicent series tells the sty of Tim Hunter a Brish boy who learns  that he is dested to become the wld's greatest magician There are some  6 books so far the first one wrten by Gaiman is available from Amazon  as are some of the excellent followg books wrten by John Ney Rieber  The series should appeal to adult  child fans of Harry Potter alike
We have read all the Harry Potter books  always enjoy the creative sty les  magical begs but book #4 really disappoted us wh the language  The use of &quotdamn&quot has occured several times spoken by  adults  the ma characters which are kids!  It's really totally  unnecessary  could easily have been avoided It's so prevalent that we  read the book wh a pen beside us to cross out the curses  substute  our own wds  This is a book f children  shouldn't be teachg them  how to swear  Swearg isn't necessary  detracts from the other-wldly  scenario of the whole sty
This book was the best book I have ever read! Everyone must read  Its fun f all ages  excg I have read the other three  this is by far the best
Like some of the other reviewers I am not  the sterotypical Harry Potter age group--I'm 32 Yet I read this book  one day The Goblet of Fire is a classic Some of the youngest readers will be readg this series  to their children  grchildrenWhile I will agree wh some  reviewers that this book is darker  tone than the other books I do not  see this as a bad thg Read Dahl the Peach ran over James's  relativesMatilda had a messed up family hunters were turned to  ducks  The Magic Fger Not everythg is sweet  nice  the wld  but good still opposes evil which is a common theme  this series even  when people try to demonize I am eagerly wag f Book 5--even to  a greater extent than I waed f this book--just to see what will happen  next In light of this sty how can anythg be the same ever  aga?I've been gog to whdrawls already  am startg to reread  the series Don't let the age range amazon lists deter you from readg any  of these books You'll truly be missg out
When JK Rowlg told us her fourth book would be darker Iwonder  parents understood what that meant While I enjoyed herstytellg immensely once aga especially the Quiddch Wld Cup  the dragon challenge  I found  easy to fgive a few sensless plot ventions many elements of her sty make me happy I do not have to wrestle wh the pressure to keep  from  share this book wh an adolescent I knew this book was dferent from the first three early on when adults students  Harry himself started usg &quotdamn&quot  &quotdamm&quot que casually The students' hum  practical jokes became me bawdy  crude yet seemgly well-sued f kids just turng 14 (by the way is Harry the only one of his friends to ever have a birthday?) I thought the darker elements would be along the les of the activies at the Wld Cup when nocent people were ttured f spt  a scull wh a snake slherg from s mouth was projected  the sky But the light fun  seemly low body count do not prepare the reader f the last few chaptersSuch violence would not be as troublg   was not later dignied  explaed by the kdly Dumblede as a noble sacrice to the cause  as an example to the other Hogwarts students that their fellow students' death could easily be their own  they do not know the truth about the evil lurkg out there I found these were not just scary images flashed briefly on a screen that produce only enough harm to conjure a few nightmares but ideas that add to adolescents' glamization of violence  trajedy Many high school freshman of Harry's age read &quotRomeo  Juliet&quot  lerature classes  then gly suicide as a romantic  plausible end to a troubled love affair I certaly would not hold Ms Rowlg's books accountable f any bad behavi of her readers but rather hope parents' consider these elements befe puttg the book  the hs of young children whout at least discussg some of s elements wh themn whout at least discussg some of s elements wh them
I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series but I felt this one's plot was extremely contrived It did not feel at all ganic  as an earlier reviewer poted out  was unnecessarily convoluted to reach 's climax  The previous book  the series held together as unied wholes This one  felt tacked together It's as  Rowlg was thkg ahead to books 5-7   thkg of the plot les she'd have to set up rather than  considerg what would be a good book   of self That said  was a  light  funny volume wh lots of the weird magical devices that I love  to read about I didn't at all md the &quotdark&quot turn  fact I  wished  had been yet darker
Ages 9-12 shouldn't get to have all the fun!  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is a terric sty f anyone who has ever wanted to fly  gazed longgly at a poster of a fave athlete wishg that athlete  could come to le  JK Rowlg makes  happen   your imagation  hasn't been too stled  trodden down by the concerns of everyday le  then this book might be f you no matter what your age &quotThe Goblet  of Fire&quot is excg funny frighteng  impossible to put down  I kept tellg myself &quotjust one me chapter&quot until I had  fished the fal 450 pages  one fell swoop!  The hype  hyperbole  proved to be fully justied  Ms Rowlg has shown herself to be a  wonderfully creative  sightful wrer  As a juni high  high  school English teacher one of my ma frustrations is the fact that my  students don't want to read f pleasure even when given time to do so   class  However the Harry Potter series has renewed the hope wh which I  began my career 15 years ago that books  good old-fashioned  sty-tellg  imagation weren't yet out of style  Thanks Ms  Rowlg f Harry Potter Hermione Ron  the rest of the Hogwarts gang  yes even Draco Malfoy the kid we all love to hate!  And thanks too f  brgg back my own juni high memies after all these years wh your  refreshgly honest  accurate ptrayals of young boys  girls  discoverg new experiences  gettg to know each other aga f the  first time
This book was certaly darker than the rest of them I won't say who dies f obvious reasons but I was shocked I almost cried You're thkg &quotWa she's not serious they'll brg him/her back!&quot   meanwhile they're dead Snape's past is confirmed Hermione becomes  attractive (f one night) Ron  Harry have conflictg opions the  first dance is held an underage wizard gets to the Triwizard Tournament  (coughHarrycough)  much me happens It's a good book  you won't be  able to put  down I know I wasn't  I read the thg  four hours (734  pages! I stayed up till one am though ^^)  the end was  unsatisfyg to the pot of disgust My father was ragg over that when  he fished Ms Rowlg is obviously enjoyg teasg her readers We'll  have to wa at least a year f the next one  meanwhile everyone will  be dyg of suspense ^_-  It was great though Thirty-seven chapters of  suspense trigue  a large dose of hum Read 
F the first 635 pages  so I was absolutely enthralled wh this book  Like the others the fourth stallment cludes wonderful magical creatures credibly descriptive scenes  great mysteryThe last  several chapters are dedicated to explag the mysteries created wh  the book  In the past Rowlg has dazzled me wh how well she could tie  the plot together  This time however I was not as impressed  It seemed  me like a bad Scooby Doo endg - the solutions to the mysteries felt  contrived me like trickery than good wrg  The endg also leads one  to question the purposes of some of the plots contentI will adm  whether some of the content had purpose  not  was still a great joy to  read  In the end however this book does not hold up to the others   terms of lerary qualy
When I got this book I was a ltle timidated by s thickness Don't be I'm not gog to ru  by tellg you all about  but I will tell you this This Harry Potter book is the best yet!  It is so wth wag all that time f Be sure to get 
Unlike most book series Harry Potter never loses s qualy Despe s length I flew through this book on a plane ride bound f France  I couldnt put  down  Though people may build a small grudge agast the  series due to the darker plotle i found that this book was me of a  realy check f the reader It clues you  to Ld Voldemts true  cols Now he's not just You-Know Who he's hes got character  It gives  the series a me down-to-earth badguys-arent-all-talk st of thg  I  also liked how this one didnt start off wh Harry eagerly anticipatg his  annual return to Hogwarts Congratulations on another job well done I cant  wa f the 5th one
The book is a fun read  will not disappot anyone who hasread the earlier books  the series The sty is fairly tightentertag surprisgThere are a couple of fgiveable plot flaws My only real cricism at the moment is that the book is unecessarily long I suspect that the relationship between Ms Rowlg  her ed has changed
I had to wa f my 18 yo who devoured the newest Harry Potter  one night  my 11 yo to have first shots -- both loved   And I did as well  F someone who cut their teeth on sci fi/fantasy JK Rowlgs is a  taste of comg home  It's delightful watchg her characters grow up see  their relationships change  grow  watch Harry's sty unfold  If  you haven't picked up the series yet you should  see what all the buzz  is about!
While this book has certaly garnered 's fair share of reviews - I felt that I had to add one me  I have read all of the Harry Potter books  I simply loved number four  I have also never been stopped by so many strangers on the street to be asked about a book  It seems as tho everyone  wanted to know how the book was   I had read the previous three  I  told everyone that still has an ner child to run out  buy this book  (as well as the first three)JK Rowlg seems to be gettg better wh  age  experience as does Harry  She has really exped her wgs   this stallment of the Harry Potter seriesWhile the book begs  exactly the same as the past three books - wh Harry stuck at the  Dursley's f the summer  his friends the Weasley's must rescue him so  that he can go to the Quiddch wld cup fals - readers will be happily  pleased wh the rest of the bookBut this is where the similaries  stop  the real imagation begs  Whout sayg too much - this novel  is (obviously) longer than the previous three  while most people were  stunned at the start of the book - I thk I can safely say no one wanted   to end  I would have been happy wh another hundred pagesThgs  turn f Harry  number four - as he reaches adolescences he has to deal  wh all the ups  downs  brgs wh  a first crush  a paful  loss as well as tauntg  tryg to discover who he really isThis  book is once aga a triumph f readers of all ages  So s down   enjoy the ride
Befe the release of GoF I was scared the book would not make expectations  be somewhat bg after all the attention  publicy  It was better than I could have dreamed  And wh the vention of several  new twists  characters (Death Eaters the mystery about Snape etc)   leaves the same b of curiosy about that next book  So what is  now?  About three hundred  fty days til number five?  (Oh well)
I love the Harry Potter series  this fourth stallment still has the wonderful mix of wry hum fantastical monsters  thrillg adventures found  the first three books However I was a b disappoted because I  felt the identy of the villa was a complete cop-out  didn't s well  wh me because I couldn't que believe  It seemed that JK Rowlg  needed a scapegoat when wrg the end  twisted all of the book's  events to f I also felt that the plot dragged  some places such as  the house-elf liberation efft  (as usual) the time spent wh the  Dursleys Yet  was still a very fast  enjoyable read I look fward  to #5!
i half agree wh the review given earlier of the tle:&quotdisappotg&quot the book starts off well but JK Rowlgdoesnt clude as much of her delightful imagery she really fell off when describg the feasts  the halloween  christmas events  I really like the idea of havg a triwizard tournament but there was way too much cheatg the contestants should have done me by themselves especially Harry But the first task of the tournament i have to give JK  cred f  was spellbdg  Anyway i shouldnt be talkg down about this book so much when i read   2 days  was not the auths best wrg but  was a great book anyway
I loved this book once  was  my hs  never left Thebook was so trugg that I stayed up till 4:00 to fish  Thereason I am sad is because once you were half way through the book you were half way through the entire Harry Potter series  that is not a good thg This book had just the right amount of every thg ActionSuspenceHumThrillsHappess  Romance  only evry auth could wre as well as Ms Rowlg I have nothg but rave reviws to give this book
JK Rowlg has another success on her hs There were onlya few problems wh the book The biggest one was that I found extremely predictable A lot of the &quotsurprises&quot I figured out far too early The shock was gone Also some of the subplots were grossly under-developed I hope she contues some of them  her followg books  All  all this book is terric Kudos!
Go get the book! It is a roller coaster ride of adventuresadness joy  laughter!  Need I say me! It is better than #'s1-3so go ge !
When I was listeng to all of the STUPID advertisements f this book I was thkg that the book would be better than the other three maly because  longer books the plot is nmally me terestg  Well- this  book was surprisg but  wasn't because  was the best 's because   was the wst  The plot slows almost to a stop  the middle  's  hard to get back on track This series is igional but personally I have  to agree wh my mother that the only reason the series is so popular is  because there's nothg out there  No other books are wrten f this age  group so when somebody fally does wre one everyone says they love   they couldn't put  down whatever  Would you like to know why they  couldn't put  down?  Because  they did they would never pick  up  aga  Would you like to know why they say they love ?  Because  they  hated  then they would have nothg to do durg those few days after   comes out when everyone is still tryg to fce their way through   Don't get me wrong I have read all of the books but only because Barnes   Noble was out of the Mercedes Lackey books  I read this 700 odd page  book  a few hours- I also knew that  I didn't read  then I would hurt  my mother's feelgs when she went out  bought  f me  I would  like everyone out there to know that there are some books f teens out  there  they don't have to be stuck readg this dribble  Head f the  books by Mercedes Lackey  Anne McCaffrey- all of their books are better  even though none of them have been the subject of radio commercials (  maybe 's because of that)  Well- I can't tell you what to read- I  can only tell you that there are better thgs to do wh your le than  read this junk
F the most part this was a great book It refced the  ma characters connection to one another while  also brought Harry  company along  their development as dividuals who are gettg older I  thk the dark nature of the threat  the resultant consequences is  appropriate to what's gog on  Harry's le He  his friends are  gettg older  will naturally be me ready to hle me mature  thgs My only complat is that J K Rowlg fell back on a rather lazy  trick at the end the old swcheroo but otherwise I feel this book is as  good as the othersWhat I have read  review after review is what  &quotgreat books&quot these are  the reviewers are right they are  great books But I wonder  anyone is as wried as I am about Ms  Rowlg's agreeg to allow the book/s to be made to a film? These books  are great because they encourage readers of every age to want to READ not  watch a movie In fact Ms Rowlg has been hailed all over the globe as  the auth who made children want to read aga She's given us all a  wonderful wld that we have brought to le  our own mds  that's  her gt But what happens when the film is made? What happens to all those  imagary Potter wlds then? They get snuffed out  replaced by someone  else's vision  some day I suspect like other great children's sties  no one will even remember that the Harry Potter sties were once a really  great booksNot every book needs to become a movie
Rowlg's books just keep gettg better  better  Each book  the Harry Potter series takes the characters to a new level  They contually become me complex  terestgOne of the thgs that I love  about these books is the development of the teachers as tegral  characters  Each book troduces a new  terestg - sometime  frighteng  sometimes entertag - teacher  Meanwhile the returng  teachers grow  their depth  I am constantly wonderg  Profess Snape  is truly evil   he has me good hidg side him than I would  guessThe Triwizard Tournament was a fascatg twist to the usual  Quiddch Cup  gave the reader new ideas to ponder as well as exg  the wld of wizards  wches beyond the realms of HowartsWhile  some might want to be warned that this book is me frighteng than some  of the previous episodes readers ready f the adventure will be me than  rewarded f their effts  This is a truly wonderful read
I LOVED Harry Potter 4 It was so good!  Harry now 14 goes back to Hogwarts f Year 4  fds many changes wag f him there!  He goes from the Yule Ball to the Triwizard Tournament  fally to a breathtakg endg that both saddened  satisfied me Fabulous job JK  Rowlg! Folks don't waste me time readg all the reviews!  Just go   READ THIS BOOK!
Wow! It was simply great  Wh 734 pages  the book you probably would thk there would be atleast one just one bg spot  the book  Well guess aga  This book kept me readg every chance I got  I read this book  about a week (which is really fast f me It would usually take me  about 3-4 weeks to read a 734 page book)  Although I thought the endg of  the third book was better I thought that the 4th book  general was  defetely the best  So now that I have read all of the Harry Potter  books I am gog to be gog through Harry Potter whdrawl until the 5th  comes out  Hurry JK Rowlg!
Havg just fished this fourth book ( took approximately three days to do so) my first reaction was to wonder how the young readers the Harry Potter series is tended f would react I'm pleased to see that they  appear to be hlg the end of the novel wellAs wh the first three  books I enjoyed the ltle details of wizardg le thrown   (particularly the Weasleys' clock showg where they all are at any given  pot) However the turn f the darker at the end of the novel disturbed  me--   disturbed me (a 21-year old) how would  affect younger  readers? I was happy to see how well they seem to be hlg Some  people may cricize Rowlg f takg this turn wh the series but 's  a necessary one Growg up isn't easy f anyone  we all have to deal  wh paful choices  loss Harry's plight is one we can all deal wh   hopefully  will create conversation between children  their  parentsAs ever I enjoyed this book immensely  am trigued to see  where the series will go from here
I enjoyed the book immensely but I have to agree wh one of the other reviewers  say the  could have been done  a lot less pages   was predictable Don't get me wrong  - I'm an adult who loves Harry Potter  I waed f this one to come out along wh everyone else but I didn't get  that same feelg that I couldn't wa f the next one after fishg   And I can't help but thk that  I were 8 years old I'd have a hard time  just ltg this book!
JK Rawlg I applaud you!  Harry Potter is simply the best series I have ever read  I am way above the targeted age group  I have been spellbound by Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire is thrillg  It captured  my attention from the first paragraph  has not let  go yet  I can not  wa to see what happens next  I can not thk of the wds that would  give this book  s auth enough cred  READ IT! READ IT! READ  IT!
I don't know what the auth did but she got my attention Any book wh this much excement   should be given a ten-star ratg This is most likely the only book I've ever stayed up till 4:30am readg   considerg the fact that I don't read f fun that much any me 's  amazg If you haven't read this book get  from Amazon now ('s the  cheapest price on the net-40% off) Broke? Sign up f the wag list at  your library I haven't seen one ratg whout good marks
We all knew this book would be a bestseller but would  live up to the hype?  No book  histy has had this kd of pre-publication mania  It would take a great book to survive that kd of publicy  Ftunately f  children  adults everywhere Rowlg pulls  offMy biggest concern  about the book is s length  When I heard about the size this book was  gog to be I thought Ms Rowlg might have bten off a b me than  she could chew  I f one enjoy long novels  In fact one of my pet  peeves about the modern novel is that these 180 page knock-offs are beg  touted as novels  However a long novel that is very readable especially  when your target audience is kids is a maj task--a task Ms Rowlg  accomplishes admirably  The conce of the Triwizard Tournament really  keeps the book gog  opens up a lot of possibilies f teraction  wh the other magic schools which I thk can really add somethg to the  future booksIf I have any concern about the book is that  really  leaves me wonderg about the future books  I enjoyed the &quotschool  atmosphere&quot of the first four books which I don't thk can be  sustaed sce a pched battle wh Voldemt must be comg  Real le  is gog to draw the focus away from Hogwarts  I hope this doesn't happen  to a great extentStill this book shows that book 5 will be another  bestseller  deservedly so  I know that Ms Rowlg wres f children   I'm not one but I've always said that a truly good &quotchildren's  books&quot will also appeal to adults  This series certaly does  I'd  like to compliment Ms Rowlg f a job well done  I look fward to  future volumes wh the excement of a child
the auth really got me  this book the way she tied  all the other books was amazgusg the spells the teachers  the previous events was just awesome i just hope harry can get through another summer wh the  Dursleys considerg what happenes  the end
the first book was very pul jk rowlg seemed to stra to keep the chapter gog i am not a fan very simple  predictable this series is not very entertag i am sry all you fans
JK Rowlg knows how to capture the terest of any age  Look at me 41  I absolutely enjoy all 4 of the Harry Potter books  can't wa f the next one  This is a great read f any age male  female!
I thought the latest stallment  the Harry Potter series exceptional!  JK Rowlg hles the plot wh penache  delivers a sty that has her readers clamg f me  She strgs the reader along wh clues   hts only to deliver a twisted  unexpected endg begng as  she cleverly puts She deals out just enough fmation to keep you  terested but still curious  There are still multiple questions left  unanswered  many plot twists that could occur  The sty was excellent   a wonderful follow-up to the celebrated third book  My only problem  was wh the length  I thk Rowlg could have done w/o the repetative  details  It slowed down the plot  caused the middle of the stroy to  drag  As a result book four was fabulous--but sht of perfection  Book  three still remas my absloute fave
I thought this book was great   did take a ltle extra time to read because of the length but  was totally wth 
I decided last week that I needed to read the Harry Potter books befe I could return to my 450 students this fall  They were buzzg about the first three books last year (We even had two Harry Potters at Halloween!)  but I hadn't found the time to read them  I dered all four books--    eight days I read all fourI truly enjoyed the characters-- I see a  lot of my young self  Hermione  As a teacher of young adolescents I can  tell you that Ms Rowlg hs their emotions  reactions squarely on the  head  I often giggled as I was readg these causg my husb to wonder   he should beg readg about HarryAlthough this fourth book is  deed darker than the other three  certaly is no me violent than  the television programs  movies that some children watch  If you are  bothered by swear wds bear  md that there are a few stances where  &quotdamn&quot is uttered  the bookAll  all The Goblet of Fire  is fabulous  I'm exced to get back to my room  the fall to  &quottalk Harry&quot wh my kids
700+ pages seems dauntg to most people who read this (whether they are child  adult) but shtly after you start readg the pages are flyg by JK Rowlg was able to hold my terest throughout the book In fact I  can't wa f Book 5
The 4th book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was overall agreat book  It goes to great detail almost a ltle too muchwhich makes  so long  It wasn't what I was expectg  took me que a while too read  Overall I thk  was wth 
I am a thirty-four year old woman who could not wa to get home from wk every night to read the next chapter  Rowlg's fourth stallment &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  I never could figure out  what was gog to happen next  how the book would end The sty was full  of plot twists  turns that the reader just doesn't expect  I also  enjoyed how Rowlg contued to develop  mature her ma characters  such as Harry Ron Hermione the gang of unique structs at  Hogwarts The ma characters  this book are all three years older now  than when Rowlg wrote her first Harry Potter book  she has seen to   that her characters have grown socially tellectually  magically!  I  would recommend this book to anyone young  old  It is full of mystery  suspense hum  sadness  It will keep you on the edge of your seat  long to the wee hours of the mng!  I couldn't stop readg until I  had fished   what a surprise endg  had!  My only regret is now  I'll have to wa another year f book number five to come out!
I personally thk that this is the best of the Harry Potter series! A lot me action  thrill than the last three Me magic  a lot me confusg i have to say!
I am a 15 year old teen from Colado  Befe I got to the Harry Potter books I never read  Now I cant put the books down but I also cant fd anyother book that really top the Harry Potter books  I thk that JK  Rowlg is a great wrer  There isn't really any wd that can discribe  how great her books are  that Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire tops  them all  When you read her book you feel like you are   livg    you feel that you are actually apart of   dog somethg that can  help out  any way These books arn't just f ltle kids but f  everyone  It is a magical experience that makes you feel happy sad  angry frustrated embaresedexced all those feelg that make you who  you are but they also give way to your imagation  creativy  What  you see  your md makes the sty come to le  You wont be able to put   down  I hope you love  just as much as I did
First let me say I enjoyed this book tremendously  And I'm thrilled that Rowlg is allowg her characters to actually grow up  The Yule Ball  the way the characters all act is true to fm -- I could feel Harry's  teenage terr as he tried to ask out a girl  Let me also say that I  appreciate the darker side of the book  There is evil  the wld   does do real  permanent harm  the death of a character who can not  come back underles thisIt was also good to get explanations  Unlike  Harry I had been wonderg what happened to Neville's parents  I had  been wonderg wh all the evil surroundg him how he could be safe at  the Dursleys  It was also great to see that Dudley is on a diet at  lastHowever I felt that the plot was a b contrived  Why would  Ld Voldemt use such a complicated scheme to get Harry?  When there  could have been such simpler  me reliable ways to get him to use a  ptkey?  Rowlg could have explaed this by makg the magic of the  championship somehow tegral to Ld Voldemt's approach however she  did not  I like another reviewer was rather baffled by this  turnLet me say that I am also lookg fward to book number five when   comes out  I also have a question -- who else out there thks Ld  Voldemt could turn out to be Harry Potter's grfather?  The father of  James Potter?  After all we learned  book two that they have the same  type of hair   perhaps a great-uncle  somethg similar  This  would be a st of Star Wars approach but  would also expla why the hat  was so tempted to put him to Slyther
My eight-year old son  I at 43 years old absolutley LOVE these books  Even though my son can read  que well we just love to curl up on the couch together  enjoy the book(s) together  I read aloud  do  all the voices which can get tricky when I swch from Hagrid to Hermione   back aga  But these books are so well wrten wh such clear   explic detail that the voices almost read themselves  And while  readg you can almost see the Hogwarts castle  smell the foods at the  feasts  the Great Hall  feel the pa  your own fehead when  Harry's scar acts up I thk that I would read these books even  I  didn't have a child to share them wh  I highly recommend them to  everyone Enjoy!  And  J K Rowlg keeps wrg we will keep  readg  Long live HARRY POTTER!
I'm a 39 yo mom of 2 who honestly felt the first Harry Potter to be the best first novel I've ever wrten  I'm a vacious reader often gobblg 2  3 long novels  a day  unterrupted  I fd so much of the  time I st of skim through books readg tently the parts I like best  but skippg over the rest  When I read the first Harry I was delighted by  how completely immersed  the sty I was  felt like I was  fact  entranced by the sty  nothg from the outside wld could distract  meUnftunately I did not fd this to be the case wh Harry IV I'm  fond of tellg people 's as  one were makg chocolate chip cookies   doubled the recipe f dough but put  the same amount of chips as f  one batch  I was greatly disappoted at the lack of details that so  delighted me especially  the first book  I guess Harry's book list f  the fourth year should have been a tip-off:  wh only one new text  required  was clear the focus of the book was not gog to be on the  children's classesI also found the subplot of Hermione's desire to  liberate the house elves to be annoyg because after all the build up   was just dropped  Did she lose terest?  Will her campaign be taken up  aga  future books?I'm sure I'll buy  read the next three books  but my expectations will be greatly lowered  My advice to Rowlg would be  to take her time -- igne the clamg public  don't call the next  book complete until you are certa that each page is crammed full of  delightful detail
I realize that wrg review # 2300+ is superfluous but I had to do  anyway  Everyone has told you how much they love the book I want to say not only how much I love the book but Rowlg's extradary imagation   use of wd imagery  Her character names give you a mental picture of  the person befe you read her descriptions  clues to just who  what  they may be  I also love the names of the spells  the magical tools we  come  contact wh  her books  I marvel at anyone who can come up wh  a device called a pensieve! She has an extradary gt wh wds   'though this sounds like a stuffy review I love Harry  all his friends  I may be 48 but Harry fills my childish soul wh wonder  delight!  Can't wa f # 5 Thank you MsRowlg f the joy of your books!
I have never felt the Harry Potter books are really childrens' books As an adult tuned  to these books by another adult I was amazed at how delightful imagative funny  well-wrten they all are  And wh  #4 they just keep gettg better  The tone changes wh Goblet of Fire   the endg is not necessarily as upbeat as the first three but  does  not dimish Rowlg's accomplishments  There are so many layers to this  book so many thgs adults can delve to that  has the distction of  beg a book series that almost anyone can enjoy  Bravo to JK Rowlg!
Ok this  my opion is the best Harry Potter!  In this book you are troduced to Bill  Charlie Weasley Percy has started wk  he's obsessed (he's wkg on stard cauldron thickness)  Hermione gets a  boyfriend (you'd be surprised)  Hogwarts is hostg a Triwizard Tournament  between Beauxbatons Durmstrang  self (Beauxbatons  Durmstrag are 2  other wizard schools)  There are so many plot twists  this that  's  734 page gly  never gets bg  Not revealg anythg I'll just  say that you'll be VERY surprised!  It took me 12 hours whout stoppg  to read  (of course I ate  everythg but that was just really quick  wk of seconds)  This is defely a must read   was defely  wth stayg up until 1201 on July 8th to get   !
I am a 28 year old mother of three boys we are very careful about what we let our sons watch on TV  read  books I read the books first  then read them out loud So far I ade Harry Potter but I have to say Book 4  caught me a ltle off guard Don't get me wrong It is wonderful  I  will highly recomend  f everyone It is a ltle me surprisg  than the first three I was sad at the end   is sure headg f a  climax Read  you will see what I mean I can't wa f Book 5 as I am  a Muggle at heart
At first I was a b timidated by the length of the book  I wondered what child (let alone adult) would read such a lengthy novel Once I began readg the book I found I could not put  down  I thought Harry's first  terest  the oppose sex was que tactfully done (even Hermione's  &quotOh really!&quot)Ron's not even beg aware of Hermione as a female  was wonderful  so true to le  I am now readg  wh my 12 year old   enjoyg  even me the second time through  He is pickg up so  many of the subtle hum pots as he visualizes what is happeng  I am  concerned wh too young of a child tryg to read this book wh s  resurgence of &quotevil&quot  the deaths that ultimately follow   This may be very frighteng f too young a child who has dficulty  dferentiatg between fact  fancy  I can't wa until book 5 is done
I had bought this book on the first day  went out  I was so exced  started readg  right away  It pulls you  from the beggg  holds you wh twist  turns until the very end where the huge surprise  that Rowlg is famous f takes place  This book is defately the most  suspenseful  dramatic of the rest!  I would say that  ypu didn't buy   from the first day buy  now!
As a Texas secondary teacher I was curious why some parents  my cy wanted the Harry Potter books banned from our school libraries  And even though I'm not  the hab of readg children's lerature I decided to  read the first book  boy was I hooked!  I quickly read the second   third  couldn't wa f the fourth  Not only was there nothg wrong  wh the books but they have done somethg most adult book wrers have  not:  they've taken me along wh the hero Harry on his adventures  I  always felt I was really there  I have to thank those parents  I doubt I  would have ever heard of Harry Potter   hadn't been f them And as  soon as Goblet of Fire went on sail I bought  I read until I'd  fished--about two days--to the neglect of everythg else  I'll be  first  le f book number five
All the harry potter books have beaan good even great but i defly enjoyed this one the best I usually fish the harry potter books wh a day but this one hundreds me pages to love I love when the characters  actually perfm the magic  this book was full of that The Triwizard  competion also gives you a thrillg rush apparently competion is very  fun to read And  your a Quiddch fan like me the first hundred pages   so gives you lots but the rest of the book is not so full but  my  opion i like the triwizard competion even better well that's 
Four Harry Potter books are  the market three to come JK Rowlg has created a phenomena wh the four Potter books that are already on show The Goblet of Fire is by far the best of the four It expresses  my  opion how chlidren feel mature when they are  their early teens The  characters are well sketched A fe le separates the villas  the  heroes The plot  self has a dfrent air about  Well mixed a  marvellous perfmence exposg the wrer's talent Rowlg has mystied  me  probably others wh the book It is as though she is jugglg wh  the reader's md The Goblet of Fire is a complete book Death fun pa  hr frustaion  the usual competivesness surrounds the basic plot  (has everythg doesn't ?) Only after readg wh terest like  never befe will the reader realise that Rowlg is probably the only one  who could tell a sty like this one  such an terestg manner the  reader will also undoubltably realise that Rowlg is - The Auth Who  Shaped The Potter
As an aunt of 7 nieces  nephews aged between 6  12 I never imaged we all would be talkg about somethg wh such excement  enthusiasm  We all wish we could have gone to a school like Hogwarts  especially around meal times!  I had already read the first three Harry  Potter books (three times)  was  as much hurry as the kids were to  dive to the fourth book  It is every b as good  not better than the  others a feat not often matched  sequels  And the best part is my  nephew's mother my sister has bushy curly hair  her name is  Hermione!  Doesn't he get a buzz!
I am 42 years old  can honestly say that I am a huge fan of Ms Rowlg's wk  Wh every stallment her characters take on me le  her plot twists become me well twisted!  The mysteries she weaves  are wthy of even the most sophisticated reader yet accessible to all   She has an amazg gt of beg able to not talk down to children not  talk beneath an adult yet keep both extremes enraptured throughout Where  is number 5 ?
First of all let me start wh tellg you why I rated this book wh 1  star In my opion  really deserved about 6 out of 5 stars If I had rated  wh 5 stars you'd probably just have passed  up like all the  other 5 star ratgs right? Anyway this was an awesome book! The only  thg that I can fd to compla about was that  should have been about  2000 pages because now I have to wa the whole time f the 5th book to  come out! I read this book  about 1 week all 734 pages of ! F a busy  13 year old to do that  must have a been a book wth while that's how  I see ! This book isn't very realistic maybe that's why I loved  so  much It creates a wld where anythg is possible while meanwhile none  of  is true  our wld! JK Rowlg is a wrer like no other I have no  clue how she does what she does but I'm glad she does because I have never  read books that I liked as much as all 4 Harry Potter books Many auths  eher make their wrgs very realistic  bg  very unrealistic   completely stupid Well JK Rowlg has wrten 4 fantastic books that  are pretty unrealistic but stead of beg stupid they are completely  terestg  very enjoyable to read So I thk this is one of the 4  best books I have ever read the others cludg the 3 other books  the  series so far But may I suggest that  you decide to read the 4th book  which you really should then to read all the other books first because   will be much me enjoyable  excg to read! That's all I have to say   I hope I helped you to make the decision on whether  not you should  read this book!
I had to review the first two Potter books  now this one f a local newspaper  found the task to be a che Like the first two books this stallment reveals that JK Rowlg still substutes rampant  overstuffed imagation f clever wrg  plot construction There is  no secret behd this book's success wh young kids:  reads like a  frantic gluttonously effects-laden video game  s detail EVERYTHING is  busy  magical: every ball doknob picture spoon broom  bowlEVERYTHING The magic is so overdone that  becomes hyperactive at  best mundane  trivial at wst This book like s predecesss is  far from wondrous  mysterious It fds a place  a culture where  &quotoverload&quot has become synonymous wh &quotqualy&quot  Further Rowlg's so-called &quotbrilliant imagation&quot often comes  across as ltle me than good old-fashioned amateurish self-dulgence  It boils my blood to hear this fluff compared to Tolkien's wk Sadly  wh the Potter series even books have become nothg me than  sensational toys DOES IT HAVE A GOOD POINT? You bet! Kids are readg at  least   recd numbers That alone makes Harry &amp the Goblet of  Fire a great idea f children everywhere Hopefully  will lead them to  read better wks by far better wrers However the number of ADULTS who  are drawn to the Potter books is utterly stupefyg It shows how low the  bar has fallen  adult leracy ( spirual desperation!) when adults  start claimg that this series has &quotchanged their lives&quot To  adults who say that I would say &quotYou need to get a le befe you  can change &quot Don't get me wrong: this book is fe f kids 9-15  Anyone younger would probably not underst  And any adult who ss  around pg f the release of the next stallment should be really  really embarrassed
I am a 28 year old mother of 2 who has been Harry Potter's #1 fan sce I decided to read the JK Rowlg's series  It took a third book to be released befe I decided to read them but I don't know what took me so  long  The Goblet of Fire is yet the most emotional  excg sequel   this series  Harry Potter has proved himself aga this time by passg  the tests of the wizard tournament I recommend  to any  &quotmuggle&quot who is trigued  fascated wh the wld of  wizardry  I hope JK Rowlg has Potter's next adventure out soon!  I  just can't wa to fd out what happens next  Read  you'll love !
This one made me stop every chapter  say WOW There were so many feelgs that at pots I just wanted to start to cry I loved   really recommend 
The latest stallment of the adventures of the boy-wizard at Hogwarts will not disappot the legions of Potter fans  All of Rowlg's imagative  telligent school kids are back  fill the book's 700+ pages wh me of the rapid paced twisty-turny plot that is the hallmark  of this series  While no spoilers here some surprises awa the reader  as among other thgs Harry discovers girls  The suation of course is  hled deftly wh great w  hum as we expect from the auth  Conversely this one is a tad darker  tone than the previous three  a  death  s effects on those who survive is very realistically ptrayed  frankly these only add to the vivid realism to be found throughout these  magical fantasies  After the sty's climax the explanations go on a  b too long befe the book actually ends but this a m cricism   the endg is well wth the wa  Any auth who can get kids to read a  700-page tome certaly has this librarian's respect  admiration  The  whole series is highly recommended f everyone who enjoys a rousgly  gr read
This was a great book I recomend  f any who has read the first three harry potters However  seems that JK Rowlg is gettg a ltle spoiled In the first three harry potters  showed harry dog somethg  On the fth on however  looks like a poster  as though harry is  posg Although she has wrten four fabolous books I thk JK Rowlg  should not let  get to her head
I'll keep this sht This is the best Harry Potter book yet Buy  as soon as possible To all those who don't like this book  cricize  I say this: you have no taste  books  unless you are a famous auth you  have no right to cricize this excilent book (sry f spellg errs  I myself am no great wrer)
i really loved the book  the tests that harry was given  was really sad when the person dies   you dont want to know who dies then stop readgfirst harry wakes up  has a dream about voldermt  then  the weasleys ve harry to the wld cup at the wld cup the  death-eaters come  attack the muggles [the death eaters are the  followers of the dark ld]  then when harry gets to school he fds out  about the triwizard cup  that the three largest schools  Europe come  together  pick a champion to do a series of tests  the wner gets  loads of money Some how harry gets   then goes  to the competion   then does the three tests but some how voldermt is behd the whole  thg  sets harry up  turns the tri-wizard trophy  to a pt key   then here  comes i am now gog to tell you who dies so look away   you dont want  to be spoiled sry cant tell but dont wry  is not  black  one  harrys closest friends[haridronhermoe  neville] but  this sty is very terestg  you fd out how evil malfoys dad is   how powerful dumbilde is  you fd out about harids mum also  voldemts greatest allies are the dements  giants most probably   the next three books are gog to be all about hogwarts  the battle  agast ld voldemt because he has returned to power

Wh the media blz  the evable commercialization of this series I wried that the fourth book would be good but not as spired as the first three I was happy to see I was wrong Awesome book!  While I loved  readg about the hijks at the castle  the Quiddch matches  was  great to see Rowlg enlighten the reader about the larger wizardg wld   the very real issues   It seems that as Harry gets older the  language matures  the wld becomes bigger Yes I'm one of those adult  fans of this series there is only one other fantasy series that compares   that would be the Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis  to be  that  league is pretty special  Rowlg's imagation hasn't faded at all only  improved can't wa f the fth book!
From the openg chapter set  Voldemt's (yeah that's right I'm brave enough to say his name even though I am a Muggle!) father's old house to the fal chapter on the Hogwarts Express I laughed felt suspense  wondered got shocked got angered ( a good way see below)  when I  fished I looked at   said &quotthat thg was 734 pages?&quot  Rowlg must have learned the spell mentioned  The Chamber of Secrets  (the one where Ron talks of a bewched book that you can never stop  readg) because I cannot put this thg down even though I fished   well over 2 weeks ago! All of the characters are perfect Beg Harry's  age myself I can relate to every suation he faces When he asks Cho  Chang to the ball I know the fear  nervousnes that is felt  him when  he is frustrated competg wh Cedric Diggy I know the almost hatred   dislike he feels when Malfoy is well beg Malfoy I know the anger   true hatred he feels (I still cannot believe that he has not been  ambushed  beaten unconscious wh bars of soap  socks   somethg)Rowlg is truly a gted wrer to touch all of my senses   this lerature masterpieceyou will never even notice that this book is  734 pages long (po Mch Albom I guess he won't be able to fish )  So what are you wag f buy  now!  Well until next time that the  Dark Ld who's name is whispered  shadows shall strike I rema-                                       Tom &quotSiamese Dream&quot McCd
JK Rowlg's fourth novel is amazg After three previous novels one may ask  a fourth is likely to be repetive The answer is no The fantastic  deepeng plot revealed  this novel coupled wh Harry(  his maturg) are irresistable! read !
Auth JK Rowlg leads us wh hauntg themes ever aware that Harry is close to danger  In HP4 she REALLY plays a trick on the reader by turng everythg upside down  There is no way to guess how Harry will  escape even who's good  who's evil  How can Harry trust anyone any  me?  The suspense will contue  the next book which can't come too  soonI hope the movie  the toys don't distract from the real Harry   company  Pretendg is so much fun!
Wh all the hype this received I was just a ty b let down I couldn't even tell you why but this one was just not the same The other three I had trouble puttg down I just wanted to keep readg this one  did  not matter to me I was delighted however that everyone started to notice  the oppose sex (they are fourteen) I was also delighted by the  TriWizard tournament  the Moody plot twist I did enjoy the book but  enjoyed the others me I still would reccommend
My 12  14 year-old children loved   My husb  I loved   Readers all over the wld loved   But I firmly believe our recent 10 year-old will appreciate  me  he was a year  two  Will I stop  him from tryg?  No  He will enjoy much of the book  wants to keep up  wh his siblgs  But this fourth book is much me complicated   disturbg me frighteng  grotesque me gy  eerie than  anythg my 10 year-old has experienced on screen  between the pages  I  am an English teacher  believe  challengg children's lims f  readg levels  experiences  My son will not be harmed  he fishes  the book but he will probably be que perplexed  me than a ltle  scared  He will probably wk on readg  but we won't press him   he may be daunted by the page length  SO  you're a mom wonderg  whether to get this f a 10 year old  younger you might hold off  There's always next year
I hadn't read the first 3 books  a while so I was glad to see that all the wizardg terms  allusions to the past were explaed Although I highly recommend readg the series  der I thk this book can read  alone  not only be understood but highly enjoyed Even  you have  read others this book is still a discovery wh new fascatg  characters  plot twists The book is a ltle darker than the first  three but  makes readg  all the me suspenseful You don't KNOW  that everythg ends happily You just keep on readg  hopg that   does
Oh my Harry  the Goblet of Fire is one of the best books I've read I loved ever mute of the book I stayed up to 2:45 am  the mng a few days ago because I was so addicted to the book I say that this is JK  Rowlgs best Harry Potter book yet I can't wa to f the next book to  come out The Harry Potter series are me excg than the other books  I've read If anyone hasn't started readg the series they should Even  though the ages to read the books are 9-12 I'm 18  I'll keep readg  the books over  over aga until I'm an old granny
I thoughly enjoyed the book  JK Rowlg's best wk to date It's a book you will have trouble puttg down  It's not too often you'll read 734 pages  4 days  Rowlg keeps the action comg  still leaves enough room at Hogwarts f 3 me books!
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter Series is another perfect read-aloud h  While pre-readg  (after all Harry is a mid-teenager now) I laughed aloud several times  From the Quiddch match to the  serious end the evolution of the characters motion of the action   puns keep the book hard to put down
I have read all of the Harry Potter books  The Goblet of Fire is thus far the best  JK Rowlg has done a wonderful job  Never  a million years would anyone be able to predict this endg  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  is  causg me trouble than ever  this book  The endg will also have you   tears  makes you want to jump  there  tell Harry that everythg  will be okay  Between emotions of anger frustration  sadness this is a  book everyone can enjoy
JK Rowlg does  aga wh the contuance of the Harry Potter series  The Goblet of Fire is a wonderful read  Full of adventure hum  suspense  I fd myself transpted to Hogswart everytime I open one  of her books!
this book is my favoure book  the wld I love harry potter!
This one was the best of the four wrten so far  I thought  had me of a sty to  than the first three which had a lot me explag  I recommend  to anyone any age
As a twenty year old havg read all the Harry Potter adventures now I can't que agree wh the whole &quotchildren's novel&quot idea I thk that not only is this book a ltle gruesome toward the end but I  really can't recall beg 9  so  understg much of the vocabulary   this book I'm not talkg about the magic related fiction I'm talkg  about the overall prose of the book However I really enjoyed this book I  could hardly put  down! I thk many will agree wh me when I say  &quot we want me!&quot Hopefully  won't be to long befe Harry  Potter strikes aga
I know that Harry is the star of the book  all but I fd  very disturbg when Cedric Diggy (a few years older than Harry) can easily be killed  Harry cannot If You-know-who really wanted Harry dead he would  have done  quickly stead of talkg a load of trash This I fd is  unrealistic I know the book is supposed to be magical  should really  give other characters  the book some limelight except him Some parts are  good but I found the book somehow dferent from the last 3 I WANT HARRY  DEAD I'M FED UP OF HIM sORTA LIKE pIkAcHu  Pok&eacutemon
JK Rowlg has exploed the wonderful wld of fantasy  every way The previous three books concerng harry Potter were great  However to say that the fourth book is the most amazg book  children's fiction will be an understaement In the Goblet of fire Harry now a maturg teen  fds himself up agast many dferent objects- from death to teenage  blues This is an amazg mdbogglg book The auth has added magic to   through her terestg language- simple yet dficult Also she has  done a marvellous job of tellg the sty  such a way that the reader  thks he is &quotPotter&quot!
I had discovered the series a couple months ago  as soon as I fished Book 3 I was achg f me Book 4 has been anticipated among millions--  was defely wth the wa! It was amazg how after I  fished a book so long that  seemed so sht JK Rowlg has combed  all of the essential elements of a good sty--hum adventure thrill  mystery  a ltle hr-- they all come together wonderfully   &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot I feel that the characters made this sty  so real because you can relate to their emotions The nosy  hideous  repter Ra Skeeter was troduced as a constant nuisance throughout  the book there to add to Harry Hagrid  Hermione's troubles Moang  Myrtle makes an appearance once aga but this time stead of blubberg   her stall she helps Harry along wh a mystery It's these characters  among others who make you smile laugh  become frustrated  angry I  thk because you feel how the characters do you keep wantg to return to  the wld of Harry Potter as  you part of  All three books were  spectacular but Book 4 is unique because  sets the stage f the growg  plot of the series  you defely don't feel the completion like   the other books because you know somethg big is ahead Overall &quotThe  Goblet of Fire&quot is a wonderful sty that draws you  to an amazg  wld you'll never want to leave!
Another great harry potter book! Cant wa f number 5 If you are still on the verge of buygthis book please buy  right away!  One of the best books I ever read!
I really cannot decide which book I like out of all four of them They are just so brilliantly wrten  I ade these books! They are the best books that I have ever read  I CANNOT wa until the fth book comes out READ THESE BOOKS! YOU WILL ENJOY THEM!
I'm wrg this review because the only people that are wrg the reviews are adults  It's time f a review from a kid  I am 14 years old  just fished readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  The book was awesome  Rowlg does  aga by makg you feel like you are  actually part of the book  The description is so amazg that 's hard  to put to wds  The sty of the book is also credible  This book  has a ltle b darker atmosphere than the other three books but 's not  so bad that young children can't read   I am not gog to talk about the  sty  give anythg away because this book is somethg that you must  experience on your own  I can say though that  I strongly suggest gettg  this book ASAP  Harry Potter #4 is wonderful  leaves questions to  be asked that will eventually be answered  the next three books
i fished this book  1 day i am 12 yeary old  i hate fanticy but this book is awsome
This was DEFINITELY the BEST Harry Potter book!  I'm 16 w/ a college readg level  i absolutely LOVE Harry Potter!  There's a type of trigug air about the books  WARNING: once you start readg  you'll never be able to stop!  There's plenty of mystery adventure  hum  Even  you didn't really like the first three you should LOVE this!
Though I am glad that children love these books adults should not miss the fun!  Excellent wrg  I love when a chuckle just escapes!  Keep up the good wk JK
This tale is part of the best series I've ever read  It meets all the same high expectations set by the first three  the series  J K Rowlg captures all the issues most imptant to today's newest generation   lush majical detail  'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' is  touchg  hilarious  rivetg all rolled seamlessly to one of the best books of  all time
I'm probably just reerratg the reviews of other thrilled customers but I feel that I owe  to JK Rowlg to give her book yet another fantastic review I'm almost 14 years old still a kid technically but out  of the specied age lim What's wh that anyway? I've seen kids as  young as 7  8 luggg around this 734-page novel I've also seen 80   90-year olds wh their noses stuck  this book  Just f the recd- I  read the first Harry Potter book long befe the mania h but I wasn't  the least surprised when  did It's almost funny I was stg on a  bench outside a resteraut readg Harry Potter  I saw ( a half   hour) 6 other people readg the Goblet of Fire  The book self was  amazg every step of the way I never once lost terest My Mom  I are  equally obsessed so when the book came  the mail from Amazoncom we  wrestled f  She got  first but I stole  She wouldn't let me take   wh me to camp so she got ahead but I got back  took  to my  room  beat her to the endg I thk the hardest part of readg this  book other than fightg wh my Mom over  was learng to say  Hermione- Herm-my-own-ee stead of Herm-ee-own  I hope that the next  three books are equally impressive I know that I  all of you will be  wag anxiously f year fiveThanks JK!
I usually don't care f books but everytime I hear about another Harry Potter book my eyes light up  i go as soon as possible to buy  All the books were great  this one the best It felt me complete  the twist at the end was great never would have expected !  This is one of  those books anyone  everyone will enjoy  can't put down until you're  done!  And I still want to read the book all over aga!  This is a good  book  anyone who buys this book is gettg their money's wth
Usually I never get to a book until chapter 5  6 Not wh this book though I was extreamly curious from chapter one until the very end This book may just be the best of them all!
There's no doubt about  Harry Potter are officially the BEST books  my md It was wth the long wa believe me F all those Harry Potter overlookers  f those who don't know Harry they are defely missg  somethg Like the first three books  is very well-wrten  has an  extra-dary plot that kept me on the edge of my seat f the next event   the book Harry Potter RULES!
This book was really amazg  I didn't want to fish  because  was so good  I can't wa f the fth book
This 47-year-old kid has been swept up  the Harry Potter craze-- wh good reason  Rowlg's books are imagative humous full of well-developed off-beat memable characters (my fave is Hagrid)  that grab you  a plot that leaves you wantg to know what happens   keeps you readg until the very end  Goblet of Fire is no exception  A  wonderfully imagative plot full of hum mystery suspense that never  lags I couldn't put  down--a great tale  a ftg lead- to the  remag 3 Parents are cautioned though--as Rowlg promised the sty  starts to take on dark undertones--some elements of this book may not be  suable f the pre-pubescents  And as wh her other books Rowlg  rushes to the conclusion tyg up a lot of loose ends  brgg some  connection to events  the book that while an amusg read seemgly had  no connection wh the action at h  I didn't md the 720+ pages I  almost wish she had used some me to round out to give some me depth to  some of the characters  greater connection to some of the sidebars of  the plot
as a parent of two adolescents ( one boy one girl) i have to say that this is the best harry adventure thus fari was very satisfied to see that even wh magical powers we  (even us muggles)must deal wh the  teen-age years! this was a truly enjoyable booki can't wa til the  next one
JK Rowlg has done  aga! Her first three stallments  the Harry Potter series were outstg she has outdone herself once me wh the Goblet of Fire  I am only 13 but I know a remarkable book when I see one  The way Miss Rowlg began the book was very trigug Harry Potter   his friends are troduced to suations that children around the wld  face everyday wh magic  fantasy added Que frankly you know you are  readg an excellent book when you can't put  down until 2 am which is  common f Harry Potter enthusiasts such as myself You get to both love   despise the characters  the book You cannot expect thgs to happen   the Harry Potter series because of how shtg the topics are At the  end of each chapter you want to read on Unexpected happengs pop-up all  over the book In my opion the Harry Potter books have terric  characters plots  they are filled wh the imagation of a child  which makes the Harry Potter series so unique
i really enjoyed this latest stallment  the Harry Potter saga   d't seem the 732 pages  is because you were always volved  Harry's thoughts emotions  actions i would suggest  to anyone whether a  Potter fan  not though  would help to at least know the sty  leMs Rowlg is a masterful wrer  i hope she doesn't stop  anytime soon  Keep Harry's escapades comg!
Some time  the distant future  shall be remembered as the epic that saved lerature f children the sty of an dary boy whose dreams come true a pure but lovely tale that brought alive f us the impossible  It searched  found the child  each of us  And left us wh a ltle  somethg to remember  If books are really the last magic there is then  this is truly powerful  will make you laugh  cry  wonder Your  house will blow up but you'll refuse to put  down
Usually auths right quick sequels to a great book but  is usually sht  loses the greatness of   They repeat same thgs  aren't as detailed as the firstThe sequels to Harry Potter become me powerful than the ones befe  wds cannot describe this book wonderful  great awesome powerful nice friendly good best glued smart  brilliant none can best describe the Harry Potter Goblet of Fire!
What can one say?  This is not f muggles who are weak at heart!  A fantastic rollercoaster ride of suspense treachery  of course magic!  JK Rowlg is on her way to beg one of the best fantasy wrers of the  21st centuryFget that nonsense that Harry Potter books are &quotJust  f Kids&quot  I am 32 years old  although a kid at heart I fd I  can not put these books down  Yes 's long - but I still flew through   's hold on the reader is that strong!  All I can say is Ms  Rowlg - keep 'em comg!  You say you can't wre a book  6 months -  well I hope you won't keep us wag too long f book 5!  I must fd  out what is happeng! Danger  trigue lie ahead f young Potter so I  say - &quotAccio Book 5! &quot
As  the first 3 Harry Potter books Harry along wh his 2 best friends Hermione  Ron endures a large amount of excement pa fear  fun  Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry f the start of his 4th year only to fd that this  will not be a nmal year (Read the book to fd out why!) The year  progresses wh lots of adventures f everyone  although  is  fun f some students  is also highly dangerous f others Oh  yes  Hermione gets a boyfriend!  A brilliant read f all ages  END
I loved this book! I am an experienced reader I have read many novels all by dferent auths  I must say that the Harry Potter series are some of the best books that I ever read The books are wrten wh great detail  's almost as  they were wrten to play a movie  your  md While readg the books I experienced actually beg able to see  what was happeng  beg able to percieve everythg exactly as the  wrer wanted me to see  When I thk about the books after I have read  them I don't thk of the wds I thk of the movie that my md made to  go along wh the wds I have read all four books  the series  I  cannot wa f book 5!
I heard about &quotThe New Harry Potter&quot  I was exced but  I was expectg the same schoolyear theme Quiddch matches escapg the Dursleys etc  Wow how wrong I was  From the begng the h auntg  tale unfolds to a wk of art no other could match  JK Rowlg has  done  aga wh each book gettg better  better  As I fished I  gave a sigh  woshed f me  It was a big thumb up!
Don't get me wrong  In the end I liked Goblet's plot as a wholeBut jeez would anyone like to concede that just maybe Rowlg's sty tellg has become a ltle long--the-tooth?  Yikes!  I like everyone  else on the planet anticipated wh excement Goblet of Fire's July 8  release but was frankly disappoted to fd I could (just) barely make   thru the books first two chapters!  I could not believe how dferent  book 4 was from 1 thru 3 how distracted the auth's wrg had become   how frankly commercial Goblet was  I have nothg but praise f the  other books  the Harry Potter series but where I could not put the first  three down wh Goblet- I couldn't fce myself to pick  up!  I actually  had to read Goblet's last 100 pages to motivate myself to trudge thru the  first 600-plus!  How sad is that?  In conclusion yes I did fish book 4  (actually chapters 1-2 then 8-37--I skimmed the rest)  would recommend  book 4 to others wh a wd of warngThis book was most defely  fced!  Goblet's plot could easily have been told  300  400 pages  I'm crossg my fgers that Rowlg fds a better ed f book 5
This is by far the best Potter book out there someone dies Harry falls  love  lots me so  you don't read the Potter book start from the start  read all of them
She's done  aga  It's me brilliant than the lastIhad a fantastic time readg Now i just have to fd somethgto keep myself occupied until the next one comes out
wasssusp? hey i'm not a kid i'm a 27yrs netwk admistrat of an IT Solutions group dont get me wrong there abt this book 's just great   they told you that  is f kids only they lied! hey dont  you say that we adults just watch p0rn'  read bunnies mag only we love  this kda stuffz too! I wish you all have a great day  please  pardon my french!trieu
JK Rowlg has wrten her best Harry Potter book yet  HarryPotter  the Goblet of Fire takes readers on an imgnative thrillg adventure through year four at Hogwarts  Harry is aga faced wh a problem This one though proves me serious  ultimately fatal He has to complete three tasks that lead him on the adventure of a letime- an adventure that he will never fget  If you're lookg f a page turner you've come to the right book  I found  hard to put this book down  I wanted to know what was gog to happen next  When I reached the end I wanted me Harry Potter  I eagerly awa the fth one
This book is one of the most delightfully imagive books Iveread sce the Lion  Wch  the Wardrobe I just couldnt put down I read   3 days  I did not want to see the end of  I recommend this book f ages 10-100 THE BEST YET
I read the first Harry Potter book last March  My bosses welent  to me   was fabulous  Befe I knew  I had purchasedBook 2  3  had Book 4 on der  It was delivered to me on July 8/00  I immediately dove right to   It is credible  was well wth the wa
The latest stallment  the Harry Potter saga reaches even deeper to mythological themesFabulously wrten once you beg to read this book you won't be able to put  down
I read   2 days of almost non stop readg I wouldreccommend this book to anyone And to those who read my review Iwillgive you one ht of what the book is about One of the teachers isn't who you thk he is
REALLY enjoyed this book have read all 4 books &amp can't wa f the next one HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!
I thk the fourth book was great It is very creative  that JKRowlg is a very gted wrerI thk everyone should read this bookI really enjoyed  from the people I know who read  said  was fantastic adventurous terestg
I`m 14 years old  I`m from Germany but I've got relatives Engl so when I heard that the fourth book was to come I phoned myaunt immediatly to send me a copy because `s just not the same to read   German Anyway I fished   2 days ( nights) only gettg up to eat `n` drk IT`S A WHOPPER!  Just as readg the first three books you really get hooked on  After readg  I needed time to come back to Muggle-Wld`` because you really get volved  the sty I can only recomend !  Have fun readg ! (I don`t know how I`ll survive until the next HP comes out)
WOW  That is a wd can't even nearly encompass all that isHarry Potter I'm a fan of this series I have read allthe books  some twice I bought #4 from Amazoncom   arrived the day  came out I fished  4 days later  The wld that Rowlg conjures up is so perfectly detailed that when I was done readg the book I could hardly believe  wasn't all real This is the best book I have EVER read  Yes  is much darker than the others  the series but  made  all the better The end left me so engulfed that I can't stop thkg about   All the new adventures really were heart-stoppg  I can't say much about the plot because I dont want to ru  f those people who haven't read  yet But I can tell you  was thoughly exg  I can't wa until the 5th book comes out Until then I plan on busyg myself wh readg all the books aga  aga  aga  agaI thk that the books  this series are f ALL ages  that  should be shared as a true treasure of lerature f years to come
Well what is there to be said but that JK Rowlg is one ofthe best wrers to come along sce CS Lewis All of the MagicMystery  suspense is truly the key to this captivatg series of books And wh the release of &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot I me than ever am reassured that many readers young  young at heart truly believe  the l of Hogwts platfm ne  three-quartersQuiddch  Diagon Alley the wld of HARRY POTTER
I've read a lot of books but this is surely one of the best  I thought the other Harry Potter books were great  this is fantastic  I thk the best characteristic of this book is that Rowlg fally brgs back the biggest bulley  the playground Ld Voldermt  You also get the  chance to learn alot about the arch-villian like why he killed his own  father what his suppters call themselves what new fm he starts out  the sty   what becomes of his fahful serveant Wmtail!  There  are also many great details that the fmer books didn't have like harry's  love le  This book of coarse like the others brgs back old  characters  troduces new ones  F example we learn that Dobby has  now taken up a job as cook at Hogwarts  Sirius Black Cho Chang   Cedric Diggy each play very large parts  F new characters Rowlg has  put together a startlg array of creatures  Moody a powerful wizard wh  a magical eye  a wooden leg Wky a house elf who's always mopg   Krum a famous quidch player competg agast Harry  the Triwizard  tournament (who gets a b cuddly wh Hermione) are just a few of the  strang new characters  So from tryg to get a date  the next Yule Ball  to duelg Voldermt one on one (wholike Harry has a w that contas  one of Fawkse the Pheonixes feathers) Harry is full of surprises f the  eager reader
This book is defately the best of the four f a number of reasons  1 It is longer  will keep you readg way past dark  2 It does not follow the usual time period of the other three you know  starts at the  Dursleys  ends at the Dursleys  This starts at the Dursleys but then  shts to the Weasleys  But I won't give away the sty f you  3 It  has PLENTY of action  I mean I read 125 pages  two hours  It really  keeps you glued to the pages  This book is defately the best of the  four  I suggest people of all ages to read 
This book is the best yet I've read all the other Harry Potter books It may be very long but  is enjoyable I can't wa to read the 5th book I don't care how long  is Even my mother likes Harry Potter Even adults will like this very likeable boy
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of the mostappropriately vivid childrens texts that I have ever laid eyes onThe sty starts out  Potter's relatives home the Durselys wh whom I greatly sympathize  First off the extremely discrimaty Ms Rowlg has to repeatedly pot out young Dudley's weight problem  a humous man  If someone is unftunate enouph to be that obese I do not believe  should be poted out  such a way  Harry decides to jo his friend Ron Weasly  his family to view the Quiddch wld cup a sptg event f wizards that also turns out to be extremely violent not to mention potless  Sure you may thk this sty is amusg right now but when Voldemt fds a way to get to us muggles you won't be laughg  Be warned this is not just a sty  is realy except  real le there is no Harry Potter to save you
F the fourth time Joanna Kathleen Rowlg awes a wide range of readers across the globe restg the magic that engrossed us  the first of her magnicent wks Her charmg characters are stronger  me poignant  than ever befe On behalf of my favourism of the overwhelmg  tellectual Hermione Granger the Yule ball was a well deserved surprise  As a wrer myselfI must say this book is an astonishgly good read   on the behalf of readers who have not yet fished  even started this  book I will speak of  no me  leave  at this:A magnicent book  from start to fish
I just fished readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Ittook me 2 days  while I was readg  I couldn't put  down! Ithk 's even better than the previous Harry Potter books It's got a great plot terestg characters  the end was most surprisg While I read  I felt like I was there wh Harry Potter  all his friends I recommend  to everybody terested  great books kids  adults You won't be disappoted!
This book was very well wrten  is one of the best fantasystiesThey are all suspenseful  excgThe fourth book isyet another adventure f entusiastic readers to enjoy! ~!~!~!
Wow!  As an adult reader the first time I picked up the first book i was a ltle embarassed to be readg a children's book  But sce that first chapter  Scerer's Stone I have been hopelessly hooked  I had Goblet  of Fire on der f months befe  came out the suspenseful wa  was much wth   I took my time wh the bookI read   4 days  And every chapter of the book was just as excg as the last  I was so  sad to see the book end because there are so many unanswered  questionswhat's gog to happen to Harry  the wld as he knows   Hopefully JK Rowlg won't make us wa too long to fd out!
It's stupendious but I do recommend strangers to this book to first read' The Philospher's stone' (Brish tle)  'The Scerer's stone' (US tle'first then the 'chamber of secrets' then the prisoner of Azkaban then  this book Anyway Joanne Kathleen's english is awesome
As usual Harry doesn't disappot  I read the entire book  one eveng (fishg at around 7AM)  I couldn't put this one down  JK Rowlg has wrten yet another excellent sty  I would like to preder book 5  now please!
An Awesome  breath-takg book It will have you on your seat wh eagerness  suspense That is what you will hear from crics What I say is - It is an excg book that starts from page one  doesn't end until  hours  days later It is funny scary shockg  downright awesome  The way Harry wks his way through the book is credible It is a must  have f al kids  imagive adults It is better than all of the Harry  Potters yet  not just because  is longer  Rowlg can f me  extremely cool stuff to  but because  is darker  better wrten   because  is Harry Potter That should be enough to tell you how good   is It is so good that  you read reviews that tell what happens   will ru the book It did f me so just read this one  go buy  On a  scale of 1 to 5 stars* I give  10 stars* Buy  now befe  goes out  You won't regret  unless you don't get 
This book is probably the best  the series so far I read   2 days because i couldn't put  down If u liked any of the other books u will love this one s wonderfly wrten  a great read
Ok when i first looked at this book half of me was exced tead   the other half said &quotgreat 738 pages of the samethg&quot i was kd of expectg the same thg---harry  his friends solve this deep mystery harry has to face HWSNBN (he who should not be named) aga  then he does  beats him to   then yaya another happy endg! i mean i loved all three of the other books but i thought---isnt this gog to get a b old? BUT NO! i loved this book there are so many twists  turns i dont want to ru this f those who havent read  (although  seems que impossible wh  vanishg so quickly from stes  all) BUT HE-WHO-SHOULD-NOT-BE-NAMED MIGHT NOT BE DEFEATED harry potter  his friends might have to go through some confusion--- death isnt impossible  the bookyou'll just have to read  to fd outim usg my every strength not to tell you  of course i wish i hadnt read  so quickly---beg so anxious after every page to see what will happen next that i so much wished the 5th  the 6th  the 7th  the whole series were already wrten so i could just go to the next----but i guess s a good thg jk rowlg keeps us wag im not the type of person (which is exceptionally bad f me) that likes to read books over---cause well i already know what happens----i dont wanna here  over aga i just wanna know what happens next!

This may be the best of the four Harry Potter books It's long but my children (8 through 11) fished   a few days Because  is scarier than the earlier books you should read the book first  your child tends  to get frightened Also even though this book sts well on s own 's  a lot me enjoyable  you have read the earlier books
This book defately erased any douts  my md that the Harry Potter series would ever be less than amazg The tensty of the Harry-Voldemt duel was astoundg How Rowlg thrills you at the end of  the sty leaves you beggg f the next book How Rowlg really  describes what is gog on  Harry's md when he asks Cho Chang to the  Yule Ball really shows how good a wrer she is When she compares the  Weaslies wh the Durslies really makes the dference between wizards   muggles clearer then I thought How she makes Bill Weasley a punk  a  prefect/head boy is really erestg I recomend this book to anyone  eher a Harry Potter fatic  not
I just fished book 4 approximately 10 mutes ago the events of the novel are still fresh  my md Havg said that this novel really does make the first 3 look small  comparison Whout givg away too much  this one truly is a pivotal novel  the series   seems like Rowlg  has fally gotten her mythology set   high gear This novel is not  much darker  tone until the endg which is almost completely devoid of  her trademark comedy until the last couple pages The endg is brutal  scary  excg The last few pages ht at me developments to come  but pretty much leave the reader  the dark as to what the next step will  be f the heroes By the endg you are wag f the eventual  announcement of Part 5  the contug sty of Harry  his arch  nemesis Ld Voldemt
I`m 14 years old  I`m from Germany but Ive got relatives  Engl so when I heard that the fourth book was to come I phoned my aunt immediatly to send me a copy because `s just not the same to read   German Anyway I fished   2 days ( nights) only gettg up to  eat `n` drk IT`S A WHOPPER!  Just as readg the first three books you  really get hooked on  After readg  I needed time to come back to  Muggle-Wld`` because you really get volved  the sty I can only  recomend !  Have fun readg ! (I don`t know how I`ll survive until  the next HP comes out)
Upon seeg all the hype that this book has gotten I dedided to see what all the fuss is about  So I picked up Book 1  couldn't believe how igal  fun  was to read  Book 2  3 surpassed each of s  predesec  the areas of suspense  peril Rowlg ps Harry  his  best friends Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger agast  Wh each sequel  the series just gets better  Book 4 is certaly no exception  I  bought Book 1 on July 2nd I fished Book 4 all 734 pages of  on July  9th  Thank you JK Rowlg f the experience!  The only bad thg about  fishg Book 4 is you thk &quotWhat am I gog to do until Book 5  comes out?&quot
Hi I'm a 9th grader  when I first started these books I was planng on readg them to my 7 year old ltle brother As soon as I fished the first one I ran out to buy the other 2 that were out  I have waed a  year f this book   was wth  This book was darker than the other  3 but that didn't spoil the sty A perfect adventure/fiction f all  ages I cant wa a whole year f the 5th one!  Oh  the TIME  article f this had a picture Take a look at the owl In that  is  brown but  clearly states  many places  the book that Hedwig is a  Snowy Owl  concequently whe OOPS! But READ THIS BOOK!
I am a 30-year-old married non-fantasy-readg attney who was conned to readg the Scerer's Stone  have not looked back  I received the Goblet of Fire on Friday afternoon drove to the beach f the weekend to  vis some friends  was fished by Monday eveng  Needless to say I  wasn't very sociable  Now Harry Potter starved I began rereadg the  Scerer's Stone last night  I dread the day the seventh book has come   goneParents please get these books f your children  read these  books wh them  It warms my heart to see kids this exced over readg   an ternet tv  Playstation driven wld
A few weeks ago I was wonderg what all the hype was about  Now I have read all the Harry Potter books  have to say that while I liked them all this one is defely the best so far  It has several subplots gog  on at once which makes  a deeper book  a better read than the  previous books  All the characters reveal me about themselves makg  them me real to us  The style takes a me serious turn settg the  characters up f a maj good-vs-evil battle  the future  The fact  that 's so long is a plus rather than a mus--the sty is so  engrossg you wish  were even longer  By the way I'm glad that these  books are hyped as gettg kids to read but I am 27 years old  I  thoughly enjoyed them
Well I am only on chapter 12  I can hardly put  down!  AndHarry Potter is not just f kids I'm 15  I love them
I have to adm Rowlg has outdone herself this time Thisbook is an credible new addion to the Harry Potter saga It's awhole new wld!  Old fantasy tales  folkle combed wh a twist of modern le make this series unique creative  virtually dstructible! The first three books were very effective  settg the mood plot  establishg character relationships but  seems that signs of the fal battle are becomg me  me apparent Voldemt's power is growg Harry is becomg stronger  the Mistry of Magic is gettg me twisted  devious by the mute Yes this book is defetly darker than the others  But I thk that this is what the sty is about A boy dested to defeat the ultimate evil  save his wld startg out small  gettg me  me skillful Po Harry may have not asked f this duty but that's what makes the book so wonderful! He is a seemgly dary kid wh extradary abilies He's the person we all dreamed of beg the kd who can save the day  still has to live wh everyday problems We can relate to Harry idolize him  both As usual the hum  drama were outstg  I stayed up until 12 each night readg I really am startg to get attached to Hogwarts It has a lot of similaries to OUR schools Tradions 's own set of cliques  teachers that no one really likes but no one really hates eher Wh such a familiar atmosphere 's no wonder we've all fallen  love wh this wizardg school It makes you want to got there   makes you feel like you're at a real place Despe the length this book is defetly wth  I can't believe we have to wa a whole YEAR f the next one I'll be a third year student by then! (I still haven't decided what kd of broom to get I'm gog to try out f the Quiddch team)
J K Rowlg has done  aga She has created a magical wld wh characters both vivid  unfgettable (Draco Malfoy Hermione Granger Ron Weasley  the Weasley clan Hagrid The Dursleys Merva McGonagall  etc)Harry Potter a skny clumsy wizard boy wh glasses contues to  prove himself to crics both  the book   the real wld The 734  pages shouldn't timidate anyone I don't thk any child will have great  dficulty gettg through the book not to mention the millions of adults  wag to read By all means  you haven't read any of the Harry  Potter Books then start today These books will be classics!
From the thrillg first chapter to the last chapter &quotThe Begng&quot Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book ever  JK Rowlg started this book off wh a bang She manages to brg up  characters from previous books such as Dobby Sirius  Myrtle From an  excg Quiddch wld championship  the begng to a death of a  character who has become much-loved  the end this book is jam-packed  wh excement  You learn  one of Harry's classes about three  unfgivable curses  These curses are taught  his  defense-agast-dark-arts class  The lessons are as surprisg as the new  teacher  Many hidden pasts are revealed  this book cludg  Snape's  others  an excg new Harry Potter adventure  The  only problem wh the book is that Rowlg starts the next book at the end  that leaves us to wa another year to fd out what happens next
I'm a readg teacher  have troduced my students to Harry Potter  I enjoyed readg JK Rowlg's latest novelI must adm that  was dficult to put down The one thg I had a problem wh  this novel is  the dialect that she chose f Wky the house elf  Granted Rowlg was  drawg parrallels between slavery  house elfs but did she have to make  Wky sound like Scarlett's slave girl from &quotGone wh the Wd?&quot  The house elf Dobby didn't sound like this  It is dficult to get my  culturally diverse students exced about a book that displays cultural  diversy  a negative way wh 's house elves (slaves)
At age 43 I guess I'm considered an Offical Grown-Up by now but I've just spent the last three days alternatg between pickg up the book  readg vaciously puttg  down  firmly tellg myself I had too  much to do to just s  read all day  lookg at  longgly every  time I walked by  I fally gave   just read until I was done!Once  aga the amazg creativy  vivid details had me riveted  I thk   would have been better  I had read the other three books me recently  as I found myself tryg to remember how details from the current book  related to some of the connections characters events etc from the past  booksEven though there was some predictabily  the plot (I don't  want to give  away but you just know certa thgs have to go a certa  way to keep the audience happy) there are me than enough unexpected  twists  turns built  to keep the reader guessg
Well Enother Book another Five stars but me on the other h will make  exception A great book but wh some flukes muggles could catch Like always Harry is the hero wng  all But this time there a twist   no 's no danairy twist s the most stupied twist of all!  that  even a muggle could catch  the year Harry was there Jk dont give that  stuff that Dumblede didn't knowC'monWell anyways I read this book   two days  theirs 734 pages so there had to be good parts
This is the best book I have ever read!  And I mean  when Isay that!  I wouldn't say   I didn't read the whole 734 page book a day  a half!  It was so good Now on to what the book was about Yes as all of you have been hearg someone does die  Harry Potter does show affection to a girl  he does get a chance to go to the Quiddch Wld Cup When you read  you will exple the 14th year  Harry's le YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS BOOK!  It is the best one so far  they are probably gettg better!  HAVE FUN READING HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE!
I loved no LOVED this book I got lost   Befe I new  wastwo hours later  I had just read 200 pages  didn't even know This book has  all suspense love a great fight scene I just can't wa f the next book It was unbelieveable I can't wa f the next stallment this book unlike the rest had so much me gog on  JK Rowlg has out down herself once aga how could she posibly wre another just as good But she don  befe  I know she'll do  aga The tasks were so suspenseful I thk I'm gog to read  agaI highly recommend 
This book was great! The plot was carefully wked out  decided I liked how JK Rowlg carries the mystery all the way to the endg so  has some surprisg thoughts Every Harry Potter fan should read this  book!As Harry begs his fourth year at Hogwarts School f Wchcraft   Wizardy he receives an vation from Ron Weasley to go to the  Quiddch Wld Cup wh him his family  Hermione Granger After the  Quiddch game ends the Dark Mark had appeared a sign that meant the Dark  Ld was risg to power When Harry returns to the Burrow the Weasley  family gives clues  hts to Harry But to him 's a mystery When he  arrives to Hogwarts he fds out that there is a Triwizard Tournament a  contest agast two rival schools(Beauxbatons  Durmstrang) that hasn't  happened f over 50 years As the champions wk harder than ever a  mystery occurs Who put Harry's name  the goblet of fire? Why was Mr  Crouch found searchg Snape's office when he was supposed to be ill? All  these mysteries are tied up to a much larger mystery What is ? Read this  book to fd out!
This book is GREATNO 's better than GREAT 's the BEST! 7 hundred pages of undiscribable fantastic wds!I love this book so where  the wld can I get the 5th book!One me year f  JKRowlg  the Double Smarties Wng ATHOUR!
Well the book is okay I love Joanne Rowlg's wrg style Its que suable f people my age to read =) Hope you guys try this book Its really hllarious  funny!
&quotWow&quot is all I can say  This is perhaps the best book  the series so far  It starts off wh nothg unusual gog on but soon several new occurrences take place such as the Tournament  I'm glad that this book does not have a Hogwarts Quiddch Cup   because that was  gettg rather old  The death is an amazg shocker near the end of a great sty  A very hard-to-put-down  book despe s dictionary size  A must read!
This book is fantastic! It's funny suspenceful  hard to put down! One night I ended up stayg awake till 1:00 am readg !  But f people that haven't read the first three books don't read this one first  because you won't underst some of the plot  characters But 's  still the best book  the wld!  Go Harry Potter!
This book does not diappot  Like the others  the series  is a roller coaster ride wh a thrillg climax  many plot twists  turns  I would caution those wh younger kids (my Harry fan is 8) that there are  some dark  disturbg images  this one  Muggles beg tmented f  spt  the callous murder of a character are not f the very young  I  read Harry aloud to my son  I would advise other parents who do the same  to read a chapter  so ahead  case they need to soften the imagery  at  least not read the scariest chapters right befe bed!
What can I say? The book was superb!  I can wa f book #5 People of all ages will love this latest novel
I have been wag almost five months f this book to h theshelves  once I picked  up I couldn't put  down  I read theentire thg  five days knowg perfectly well that I would regret fishg  yet the sty was mesmerizg  I just couldn't help myself
The fourth Harry Potter book turns out to be the wst of the series so far  This comes as a surprise considerg that the third was so good  The 700+ page book has enough good parts to make an credible 300 page sty  but all those extra pages drag everythg down  The auth meers  through the sty slowg  down  drag excement  Too much time  is spent buildg up to the pot when Harry arrives at Hogwarts  From  there  hardly gets better  At least one side-sty (volvg Hermione   house-elves) seems to have been cluded just to make the book longer  I was rather disappoted by the endg but won't give  away  I just  hope that Rowlg returns me to the fm of the earlier books which  featured terestg  tighter plots combed wh creative settgs  The only real reason to read the book is that the events contaed    are vastly imptant to the future novels
It's clear that JK Rowlg has laid out a plan f all sevenHarry Potter books --  that plan makes Harry's wld aprogressively darker  me dangerous place As wh The Prisoner of Azkaban the Goblet of Fire sets up events characters  suations that lger  our memy long after we fish readg the sty That's the mark of great sty-tellg regardless of whether that sty is aimed at kids  adultsEvents from book-to-book are startg to move like an acceleratg steamroller Rowlg ends book four wh extradary momentum Brg on book five  make  snappy
JK ROWLING HAS WRITTEN A GREAT BOOK  HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE IS WORTH READING  A SUGGESTION FROM ME IS IF YOU WANT TO READ THIS BOOK AND UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPENNING AND WHO SOME  PEOPLE ARE READ THE FIRST THREE BOOKS FIRST  I ENJOYED READING THE BOOK EXCEPT THAT I FOUND  THE QUIDITCH WORLD CUP A BIT CORNY AND THOUGHT THE BOOK COULD'VE BEEN  SHORTER  STILL YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BOOK
I loved this book I read 602 pages  one day I couldn't put down I fell asleep wh  open  This is an amazg book now whosays teenagers don't like to read?
I only heard about Harry Potter  the last two months (I know I must be livg under a rock) but managed to read all three  the series befe the Goblet of Fire came out  couldn't believe that this could live up to  all the hype  improve on the Prisoners of Azkaban Incredibly  does  however  I couldn't put the book down f three days whilst I read  this wonderful sty I still thk however that the dements are me  frighteng tha Voldemt Can't wa f Book 5 6  7 How JK Rowlg  can keep livg up to expectations I do not know but I sure hope she does  Yours a reluctant Muggle
This is the most excg book  the series so far-- the plot is less fmulaic  everythg just flows though you still never know what's gog to happen next The characters grow up a b as they deal wh  bigger/smaller problems than simply solvg Mystery? Evil This is a  pivotal pot  big change  the series  stead of beg  open--shut 's me like a steppg stone that leaves you beggg f  me (I would've been happy  'd been 1700 pages long!) Can't wa till  Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts!
This was a long but entertag book  She describeseverythg so well  I wont tell you any me you must read  on yourown  Read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire today!
Harry Potter contues his adventures  the wizardg wld  this fourth volume  He faces ever me dangerous foes  has adventures beyond anythg dreamt of  the first three  I read   three days   then aga  two  Fun  excg -- although I wouldn't give  to my 7  year old kid f a couple me years  can get pretty tense  The  characters are growg up nicely!  Rowlgs demonstrates that she remembers  everythg about beg a teenager Highly recommended f 9-year-olds on  up!
This fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series is sure to leave readers as spellbound as the first three  Full of surprises  plot twists  kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I was readg - I stayed up all night readg  on July the 8th until I fished  at 7:30  the next mng which I didn't even do f the other Harry Potter books  And just when I thought the action was over -  almost tremblg from  the f lack of a better wd scary action I might add - I got another  shock  I won't tell you what  was but Harry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire was defely one of the best books I've ever read  However  left  even me frightened  depressed  I've been readg R L Ste's Fear  Street sce I was eight years old  Goblet of Fire while still somethg  of a children's book (albiet a long one) would not be the best book to read  to a nightmare-prone 6-year-old  The &quotbig scary part&quot as  someone I know called  once was actually one of the thgs that made   such a good book though  I would defely recommend this book  I  regret that I can only give  five stars
This book is one of the best thgs that I have read  years  It contas the perfect mix of hum enchantment  hr  I would like to give kudos to JK Rowlg f who else could keep a children's series  gog  make  better wh each step  Harry's journey is just as  magical now as  was  the first novel   leaves the reader wantg  book five  Every aspect of the wld is fallg to place   is so  complete that you fell like you are    Keep  up!  Anyone who hasn't  read Harry start now  You won't be able to stop
F anyone debatg whether to read these books READ them!  If nothg else exces you the imagation of J K Rowlg  her abily to fire up young readers should  Harry's adventures should remd all of us that our mds are our most wonderful gt  to USE them f me than vegetatg   front of a TV screen!  Buy the books!  Enjoy an adventure!  Read them to  your kids  grkids!  You will never regret 
When I first started this book I had extremeley highexpectations  However once I plunged further to the book Idiscovered that I couldn't put  down untill the end  Now upon completion I can confidently say that this book does deserve to be compared wh great fantasy wks such as Tolkien's Rgs Trilogy  Lewis' Chronicles of narnia Like Shakespere Rowlg has the abily to wre f a wide range of audiences young  old  I would defately recomend this book only to people who have a lot of time f readg  else this book will take over whatever else you want to do!
I couldn't put this downThe first 150 pages are a b slow you've read the first three books but  is also nice to read of allthe old friends--like puttg on one of Mrs Weasley's Christmas sweaters  Anyway what I thk is so valuable  this book is Rowlg's knack f characterization  These folks are vivid  This book also masterfully steers Harry through a turng pot  his le whout makg  overtly obvious to readers  We are not bludgeoned over the head (so to speak!)  wh Harry's teenage angst stead  is woven to the narrative  As a teacher I have to say that I hope all my students read this-- is a fun book that gives imagation a wkout while also connectg wh some of kids' biggest questions about parents crushes school friendship  of course how to battle a blast ended skrewt
This book  my opion is her best so far I read   a day  a half It was very good  I highly recommend you read 
Perhaps the most anticipated book  recent histyJ K Rowlg's latest stallment  the Harry Potter series does not disappot  Contug the saga of Harry Potter  his friends the book recounts their explos  the fourth of seven years as students at a modern day wizardg school somewhere  Engl    Despe s length the book is as tightly plotted  well wrten as the first three books  the series the wrg still seems targeted at the juvenile market though as wh all good juveniles  is emently readable by adults as well    The book troduces a number of new characters - one reason f s creased length -  even the adult staff of the school familiar from the precedg books seems me deeply characterized  the present volume  F this adult reader the activies of these supptg adult characters hted at  the text seem far me terestg that those of the protagonist  his friend    The one troublg aspect of this book is that Harry Potter is not que a wthy hero  He sts by his friends fights f the good guys  foils evil yes however he is too willg enjoy discomft flicted on those who are not  his clique as evidenced by his treatment of the long sufferg Dursleys a family who has Harry fced on them while he is not at the wizardg school Recognizg good  defeatg evil are imptant thgs but takg comft  the pa of others is not a lesson that needs to learned by eher children  adults
Hey I'm a Harry Potter-crazy guy who fished this awesome 700+ page book  about 2 days You may thk a book that's almost 2x as longer than the third book would become a drag after awhile but then you'd be wrong As  the sty progresses JK Rowlgs draws you to the book  the book  gets me  me suspenseful Wonderful new characters are troduced as  well as all the old faves Action adventure spts death romance  happess sadness anger  pa are all packed  this jaw-droppg  &quotcan't-put--down&quot book My suggestion is &quotDefely read  this book! &quot
I thk 's credible that a book that has been  the hsof the public barely a week  a half has already been read reviewed by nearly 1900 people  And  response to the crics of Ms Rowlg  her books how can we deny success!  As a high school librarian grades 8-12 I am thrilled to fd a book that captivates my students  helps them to fd time to read somethg other than the required readg at their grade levels  And Ms Rowlg's abily to plant plot seeds that seemgly have no solution  then to brg together all those seeds to a tapestry of wonder at the end is fascatg She is a mixture of Charles Dickens Roald Dahl  Arthur Conan Doyle  Give cred where cred is due  Our kids are readg!  Hallelujah!  And thank you JK Rowlg f your imagation  your abily to hook all of us to your wld  Just keep 'em comg!
We all knew  was comg  now that 's here every boy girl  America wants  What is this new craze?  It's calledHarry Potter  'The Goblet of Fire'  The first thg I said after puttg the book down was &quotWOW&quot! This series (Harry Potter) is gog to be a classic folks  If you haven't heard about  you will soon!  These extradary books tell about a young wizard who overcomes a great deal  a sht amount of time  Now I won't spoil  f 'ya but  you don't get your hs on these books soon You probably won't at all!  They're runng out fast so JK Rowlg better get that pen movg now  never
Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone was really good&quotChamber&quot was great  &quotAzkaban&quot was amazg  ButHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was well powerful  There are many superlatives that could be used to describe  but none so ftg  The hype over Book IV was so great that  built a level of anticipation among readers  And as I read the book  only grew My friend  I mistook lightheartedness f monotony but upon my second readg of the book I found how wrong we were  This book widely acknowledged to be &quotdark&quot has many hilariously funny entertag chapters especially  the first half but riddled throughout the book  This book is deed pivotal  The comftable pattern of complacent endgs found  the first three books was not to be found  this one  The last chapter left me wonderg how a book so long could seem so sht  beggg f me  Ms Rowlg's wrg style has improved drastically wh each novel but  the fourth Harry Potter book she reaches a new plateau: a surprisg combation of the known  unknown the natural reactions  the powerful ones  The job of a fantasy wrer is to troduce readers to a new wld  let them believe that they know   the characters as  they live there  And Ms Rowlg is a tremendous fantasy auth  Her amazg abily left me draed at the end of the book because I felt as  I knew the characters  as  their hardships were happeng to me  Ms Rowlg has the unique abily of makg us feel emotions-all f wds on a page  And that is the mark of a true gted auth-one that I can't help but love Why did I love this book?  It has everythg wonderful   Excement magic comedy suspense House-Elf Liberation Fronts- a few wonderful digs about tabloid journalism  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire answers a thous questions- leaves us wag wh a thous me  It shows that a great book does not have to be wrten f adults  be a revered antiqued relic  It is any book that touches our mds  hearts- Harry Potter as we all wa enchanted f the next volume certaly qualiest have to be wrten f adults  be a revered antiqued relic  It is any book that touches our mds  hearts- Harry Potter as we all wa enchanted f the next volume certaly qualies
this book is really graetI read a lot of books but th book beats all the others books  is Amezg! I ve read everhythg what I suspect from a book: Magic Adventure A extg sty le  this is the first book I've  whout A bg moment!but there was one thg that disapot me a  ltlethe  headle of the sty is a ltle b predictable sometimes I  now exalcy what gonna happen because  the other books from harry pottter  the samethg happened! but that was all I hope that the next book of  harry potter from the same qualy is!  laurent
This fourth book  the series of sever Harry Potter sties was absolutely the best!  I couldn't put  down!  When I was fished I almost cried I want the sty to go on  I never wanted  to end!
Blimey that was a good one ! Don't be afraid of the 734 pages They are useful because so many thgs happen when you are  4th year at Hogwarts It is true that this book might be a ltle frighteng f young readers  but their parents might enjoy  as much as I did The Yule Ball was a  ltle b feign to me but I thk  reflects english le Fleur's  accent however seems a good one Like me It is a wonder that Mrs Rowlg  didn't mix her caracters because there are a plenty But she features them  well each has s own personnaly If you meet them  the street don't  say anythg they are tryg to fool the muggles I'm wag f the 5th  year at Hogwarts
This book was very very good  I thk this was my second favechamber of secrets is first  I can't wa f book five especially sce he-who-must-not-be-name has returned
I was very exced to get the latest Harry Potter book  Ifished   about 2 days  But  my opion most people onlyliked this book so much because they were so exced to fally have  I'm still anxious to read #5 but this book was really depressg! I won't discuss the exact plot but this series is gettg grimmer  grimmer!  That  self wouldn't be so bad sce I'm used to readg grim books but the only comic relief was obnoxious ltle comments from the kids!  Yes I thought they were funny but one of the thgs I loved about these books was the funny way  which thgs were described!  Like  the first book how Baby Dudley looked like a large pk beachball  dferent-coled bonnets!  I know that I'm probably takg this book too seriously but I'm sick of hearg how great this book is just because 's new
Book 4  the Harry Potter series is just that: the fourth book a sequence that was wrten to be read  der  Don't try to wadethrough the me than 700 pages of cryptic vocabulary  you don't already know the rules of Quiddch  If you've read the first three books you don't need me to tell you to buy this book  But  you are not already familiar wh Hogwarts don't buy this book alone  Buy all four  enjoy your plunge to a magical wldAlso don't expect a satisfyg endg  As the middle book  a series The Goblet of Fire sets the stage f what is to come  doesn't tie up all the loose ends
This book was so great! I bought  on the first day that  came out  I read until 1:00  the mng!  Harry goes on so many new adventures  there are so many new jokes!  This book is defely wth buyg!  I thk the reason why everyone loves Harry Potter is because  is about  our everyday lives dealg wh the bad thgs  the good thgs  the  laughter The Muggle wld isn't so dferent from the magic wld   sometimes the magic  their wld comes to our wld  takes the shape  of miracles  this series is defely a miracle
The newest  fourth stallment of the harry potter series is as much fun as the other three  me! Harry's adventures  this book are very excg We fd out alot about voldemt  this one too I read this  book  under three days It is great!
Rowlg has done  aga! While a thick children's book seems absurd  is much needed  this absolutely thrillg novel Children are usually brought upon 'happily ever after' sties but this book changes that  every way Darkness is thrown to the book greatly a much needed  resurrection of Ld 'You-Know-Who'  the awesome descriptions of his  evil actions I love how Rowlg secures the reader by usg enticg  imagery of scenery pa  magic I also thank Rowlg f creatg a  character so much like me!  No doubt this book is the best out of all 4 of  the series so far This book is a must buy f readers of all ages!
I am  the middle of readg   I can't stop!  I mean  is amazg how Rowlg can put together a sty that has so much details   's impossible that you can't like !
I have just fished JK Rowlg's 4th book Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire If you have not started readg Harry Potter books then you are missg out on a whole lot of excg readg This book was the longest by far I was very happy at that When you fish Harry Potter books you  lerally wish you hadn't fished Its like you never want the books to  end I am very anxious f the 5th book to come out but i will be saddened  when the 7th  fal book is released  read I must reccommend this  book to anyone who can read That is how good  is I give this book top  ratgs  a Thank you to JK Rowlg f wrg such wonderful books  f kids today You really have changed the wld
This is the best Harry Potter book yet!  I thought this about each book as I read them  they just keep gettg better  better  I'm 15  I thoughly enjoyed this book  So I would highly recommend  to anyone who  loves to read of any age!  However  the latest book the plot gets me  complicated than ever makg  me of a page tuner!
As Rowlg warned befe this book was published #4 is que a b &quotdarker&quot than the previous three It has some scenes that can only be described as darker Even so I thk this book is every b as  good ( not better than) as the other books Book 4 still has the laughs   the details that have made this series greatThe size of this book   anythg is an asset It took me a 13 year old  nearly a day  (cludg stops f eatg etc) to fish this book stead of the one  to two hours of the previous books It leaves you side Harry's wld f  a much longer timeI'm not sayg anythg about the plot because you  have to read  f yourself I will however tell you that this is one  book you will not want to miss
Wow! I'm speechless This is Rowlg at her best - better than Dahl Tolkien Pratchett Carroll better  fact than anythg I have ever read The supremely woven plot will ensnare any reader to the delightful  wld of wches  wizards conjured up by the auth  I guarantee you  will not put  down untill you come to the last page In a satisfyg 647  page stallment of 'Harry' Rowlg deepens our perceptions of the  characters so much that by the end you will have laughed  cried out loud  at least once  the course of the book A novel to treasure - perfect to  share wh someone  read to yourself And the only ones who will not  enjoy this superb novel are those who say they are 'too old' I am 'old'  too yet even I was woven to the fantastic plot The grchildren are  NOT gettg their copy back - I just can't get enough of Harry  his  adventures  I award this book at least 20 stars (out of five!)
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book I have ever read  my 11 years  It has me adventures than the previous Harry Potter books  I couldn't put  down  I can't wa f the next one!
What me can be said about this book?  It has actionadventure  an excellent plot!  By the way Conan O'Brien is right!Harry Potter looks just like Max Weberg!
this book takes you to a wld that you may love so much thatyou would do any thg to get to ! JK Rowlg made  easy telate to every charater from Wky an unhappy house elf to Voldemt the darkest of all the wizards!
I LOVED the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  Yes I thk  may be too tense f ltle children but at least death is wrten as a faly  the wizards weren't made able to brg someone back to le  I thk  everyone needs to know that death is a faly  this wld  le can  be fickle  It is all very ventive  don't you wonder just a ltle  b about the md that thought all this up?  The creativy amazes me  The people are real wh real emotions whether muggle  wizard Few are  all good  all evil Suational ethics are still a problem while the  fight of right vs wrong is not easy  not always obvious who is on which  side A m irration:  There is a typo on page 155 first le  Seems  like they could have edied this crectly sce they took so long to  publish !
this book is just unreal! the dark ld rises once mebyputtg the bone that belonged to the dark lds father  the fleshthat belonged to a fahful servent of the dark ld  the blood of a person that feels hatred to the dark ld like no other mixg them together gave the dark ld his body backat full poweri will tell no me i wish not to spoil the fun of readg the book f youbut i must warn you as a aur(youl fd what that is  the 4th book)that harry does not brg the down fall of the dark ld once mei will say no me but read this book
The Harry Potter books like the Star Wars films are review-proof F those that love them there is no argument that can persuade him  her to thk otherwise N would I want to persuade anyone who cherishes these  books to thk otherwise I thk 's a great series  an histic one  -  f no other reason than  has encouraged parents to read to their  kids (as I do wh my 5 boys) me than any other book sce Tolkien's  &quotThe Hobb&quotNevertheless &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is  not whout 's flaws Rowlg's prose contues to be pedestrian at best  -  at wst irratg I don't fd this too much of a problem when  readg to my kids I can pass over such akward phrases as &quot'What are  you guys dog?' asked Hermione questiongly&quot replacg  by simply  readg &quotWhat are you guys dog?&quot  my rendion of Hermione's  voice (wh a questiong tone)Rowlg also needs to drop all the long  paragraphs recappg the events of the previous books At this rate Book 7  will be four thous pages long  3000 of those pages will be used to  recap what went befe She should start assumg that people have read the  previous books  keep the recappg to a mimum If new readers are  losts that's their problem (which they can solve wh a quick jaunt to the  library  bookste) This change will make f a cleaner crisper   me excg narrativeMy fal quibble is that  &quotThe Goblet of  Fire&quot we have two chapters near the end that mostly consist of the  villa(s) tellg Harry how clever their plans were  what they were  dog behd the scenes durg the previous 400 pages It's nice to tie up  loose ends but too much of  done  this fashion is bg Rowlg  needs to get away from these soliloquoysIf  future books Rowlg's  prose can grow to match her vision she will have created a wk f the  agesBut beyond that &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot still manages to be  an excg book wh great characters Rowlg's wonderful ventiveness   creatg this wld of wizards muggles magical creatures  dark  fces still spires She has also lost none of her abily to make me  laugh outloud while readg - whout compromisg the tegry of the  sty  the characters No small feat that Fally &quotThe Goblet of  Fire&quot takes the sty of Harry's le  new  unexpected  directionsI eagerly awa the next volume  I envy anyone who has  not yet met Harry Potter You have a great treat  steof Fire&quot still manages to be  an excg book wh great characters Rowlg's wonderful ventiveness   creatg this wld of wizards muggles magical creatures  dark  fces still spires She has also lost none of her abily to make me  laugh outloud while readg - whout compromisg the tegry of the  sty  the characters No small feat that Fally &quotThe Goblet of  Fire&quot takes the sty of Harry's le  new  unexpected  directionsI eagerly awa the next volume  I envy anyone who has  not yet met Harry Potter You have a great treat  ste
every one of those wds  those 734 pages are wth your while  i thought jk rowlg might lose her touch but 's obvious she hasn't  i don't thk she ever will
I thought this book was filled wh imaganation  darg adventures  JK Rowlg's Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire is I personally thk better than the others The Harry Potter books get better every time  this book is the best yet!
the harry potter series is perfect but i have one problem i read the books so fast i cant enjoy them i fished some 700 pages  less then 30 hours anybody else have this problem?
It is highly imagative  the auth tends not to repeat herself  the series of Harry Potter  She creates a wld which is grant  wonderful  The only thg I dislike about this series is that  the sty a hero can  lie   is alright to lie  Harry Potter lied f many times  most of  the times he was unpunished  even got good results  After all  is a  children book  at least be cautious about the message sent out
My husb  I have read all the Harry Potter books together--we have to read them at the same time so that we can talk about what's happeng  Befe we started readg the books we thought there was no way they could  live up to the hype but JK Rowlg has proven has wrong 4 times now  At  least this time we had high expectations  they were metI enjoyed  the characters even me  this book as they matured a ltle me  I  love the teraction between Ron  Hermione!I also felt this book  was even me excg than the previous three  Startg out wh a spooky  Ld Voldemt chapter really got us to the book  anxious to fd out  what would happen to Harry this yearI would obviously recommend this  book to any Harry Potter fans-- any other readers who have not yet read  the series should start now!
Wow JKRowlg did  aga! And I thk this is the Best bookyet! I would recomend Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  thefirst 3 to anyone who loves a good bookWh 's surprisg endg 's adventurious theme  wonderful charictars 's the best one yet!  Ican't wa f the fth one!
My child absolutely LOVED this book ( the whole series)  He read   one day just could not put  down!
This is the best book yet  When I got  I sat down  didnot stop until I was done  734 pages later I couldn't wa to read aga  As wh the other three books this one gets better  better each time you read   If you haven't read  yet read  now  you won't be disappoted!
The Goblet of Fire arrived 2:01 pm Saturday  My son was halfway done by bedtime  Out-of-town guests arrived 7 am Sunday  5 out of 7 people  the house read the entire book by the followg Sunday  (My deranged husb  is to Abe Lcoln  the 5 yr old can't read yet) The house is  ltered wh bookmarks  On a serious note  your children are younger  than 10 you may want to screen this book  #5-7 of the series befe you  let them read   It does look like thgs are gettg darker  Injuries   deaths to ma characters can be very upsettg Also although some  people may like all the remders my son  I have read all the books at  least 3 times  we'd rather have a ltle less repetion  Just read  the books  der
What can I say?  If this is gog to be your first Harry Potterbook then curiousy will make you buy   read   If you'veread the previous three then you just have to read  anyway  It is an enjoyable read  I recommend 
This is the greatest bookIt has magic  is unpredictable  you havnt read  you shouldIf your like me you'll never put  downIf you dont take  from me look at all 1800  some   may  convence youBut read  them  der they just keep gettg better from first to last
The fourth book  the series is defently the best I thought couldn't get any better but I was proven wrong wh this one Thisbook is not only f children thats f sure!The plot of this sty was defently darker  me mature than the other books  wh Rowlg's skill  wrg from ptendg to awesome plot twists this book promises to keep you turng pages!The only bad thg I have (that is very m) to say is that guessg the evil  this book was not as dficult as  the others But  didn't weigh down on excmentAn excellent book I'd br this book as good f adults as  is f (older) kids
Once aga Miss Rowlg has wked her way to our homes various readg alcoves to keep us glued to the gogs-on of ourbeloved Harry Potter  I read this book  just over a week  I lost track of time  I just couldn't put  down like the rest of the books Once aga I was as surprised as anybody as to how the book turned out  This book would keep anyone turng pages who has read the HP books  Otherwise  might just seem like another media-hyped book-crazed psycho-fan event  Maybe so but at least we're not gog nutters over somethg like Pokemon
JK Rowlg does  aga The way she so masterfully weaves fantasy adventure  hum leaves the reader breathless  askg f me Simply put befe you fish the first page you are pulled to a wld  where boundries are left behd  your not just an dary  &quotMuggle&quot anyme :)
As a librarian I spend my le searchg f the best books especially f children  But Harry Potter isn't just f them  I've heard 9 to 90-year-olds describe the same sense of wonder at Harry's parallel universe  at Hogwarts  Characters  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire grows   complexy as Harry gets older And unlike many sequels the prose does not  seem to have lost any of the ial sparkle  Maybe 's all those magic  ws!  To describe   detail would be to give away the pleasure of  curlg up wh this marvelous book  If you're wonderg what to get your  kids this summer consider  seriously
JK Rowlg does  aga  Goblet of Fire book 4  the Harry Potter series is as engagg  thrillg as s three predecesss  I have read many books  series by other auths  have always found that  sequels never que achieve the novelty  excement of the first book   the series  Not so wh Harry Potter  Each book  the sty is fresh  troducg new characters  suations volvg Harry  his  extradary friends  Many have said that this book is &quotdarker&quot   not as appropriate f children as the previous three  I believe that  the sty le merely reflects Harry's entrance to adolecence  As an  adult I fd these books refreshg captivatg  a phenomenal read  I  have fally turned the book over to my 9 year old who unftunately had to  wa f me to fish befe startg &quother&quot book!  F those of  you who may be terested this book  series provide a lerary banquet  Happy Readg Muggles!
I wound up readg this book 'till the wee hours of themng  And still the only thg I can say is: wow And wow Andwow aga In another year  so I should be able to scrape my ws together  wre a whole book praisg this one  F now however comm of the English language has completely deserted me I can however say somethg to the auth: Well done Well done deed Now hurry up  wre the next one!
Harry Potter is the best book  the series yet Its complicated plot  characters makes this book terestg to the end I read the book throughout a whole night  stayed up until 2:00 am to fish  Once  you start you won't be able to put the book down You learn me about  Harry  his magical communy then you have ever befe The endg is  somewhat scary [yes even to me :) ] of course is suprisg Take your  md through a much-needed vacation wh this  other Harry Potter books  Let your imagation soar  take  as much as you can
I have read each of the three previous Harry Potters at leasttwice  I read this fourth one  three days yes all 734 pages  Ilaughed cried  gasp out loud throughout the book  I don't thk anyone could have been me imagative than JK Rowlg  She makes these books so fun  famous because she has me imagation  creativy than anythg else I have ever read  She has used this  such a unique way this is defately gog to be a classic somethg the can never be duplicated
I loved this book I didn't thk  was possible f  to be me suspenseful  surprisg than book number three but I was badly mistaken Also I really wish Amazoncom would change the age range f  this book It's hardly 9-12 I'm the wld's biggest fan of the real HP   I'm 17 The age range should be 9  up is that too much to ask?
Long after the seventh  fal book is published when the hype has all died down Harry Potter will be remembered as one of the greatest fantasy sties ever wrten  The saga reaches epic proptions  book 4 where at  the end there is a febodg feelg of a mighty upcomg battle  the  wizardg wld  Wizards must decide where their loyalties lay  to what  extent they will be willg to fight  Wh the fourth book Harry Potter  has left the realm of just another children's book  become a great  fantasy sty  Don't listen to the hype Read them  make up your own  md You won't be disappoted
Yes  happened aga Harry's back some crazy stuff happens very good plot twists keeps ya readg I don't want to reveal anythg but this one's better than the other three
Rowlg's done  aga!  A year ago my mom bought the first two books  the series f my ltle brother  he didn't want to read them so I said that I'd give  a go so she didn't have to buy them f nothg  Let's just say I've been hooked sce the first chapter  the Scerer's  Stone  I raved to my friends about them (they were a ltle skeptical  given that we're 16) but I lent the book to them  now they're just as  crazy as I am about Rowlg's wonderful creations!  Naturally I bought the  Goblet of Fire the first second I could  I didn't put  down until   was done  This book is darker  deeper than the others ( so far is  tied f my fave along wh the Chamber of Secrets)  the characters  develop beautully as you watch them grow durg their fourth year at  Hogwarts  Also this book is where the general plot of the entire series  starts to kick self to action The new book's arrival has renewed my  love of the series so I have started to reread all of them  It's amazg  the way that Rowlg captures the imagation  sparks the terest of  the kid side all of us that still wants to wave their magic w  turn  a match to a needle  (You guys know what I'm talkg about) I don't  even see why we bother to wre reviews everybody  the wld already  owns the book!  The only bad thg I could possibly say is that we're  seven hundred odd pages closer to the end!  I love this series I love  Harry Potter  I love Rowlg!  I can't wa f the next book to come  out!
When I picked up Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire f the first time I was overjoyed thkg that this time  was long enough that I would be able to take a nice long time readg  so that I would have less days to  wa f a br new Harry Potter book to read I was very very wrong  I  fished the book  less than one day because once I started I could not  stop I have considered JK Rowlg an outstg wrer ever sce I  first read Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone but she did even better  wh this 4th book somethg I did not thk possible  Wh many of the  books I read I fd myself countg pages until the end but wh this  book I was so hooked that I never wanted  to be over  It is  considerably darker  me frighteng than the other 3 books but  is  still humourous  many parts  very excg
I read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  4 days! I HATE fantasy books so  you aren't readg the Harry Potter books just because you don't like fantasy books I recomnd that you try the first one I thought that this  book was the best of all of them   was a real page-turner I thk  that everybody should try readg these books because I am sure that you  would love them!
I thk that this was a great book well wth readg  I know kids who hate to read but were even willg to spend there own money to buy !  This is really a great book
I fished The Goblet of Fire this eveng havg cried my eyes out - to tell you why would give away plot details I adm when I first started readg this book I was a ltle wary of the way  started off I didn't  really enjoy Harry  his friends at the Quiddch Wld Cup I missed  Hogwarts But I trusted Joanne Rowlg  knew her wrg well enough by  now to know that the build up at the begng had an imptant role  droppg hts that would later crop up  the book And boy did  they!Such a thrillg adventure - but very dark Harry suffers me   this book then any other  at times  is paful to read But le  like fiction is not all smiles  happess  Miss Rowlg must be  praised f not patronisg the readers of that factOn a me personal  note -  fgive me f dulgg  this f a moment - I can honestly  say Harry Potter is helpg make my le better I do get depressed que a  lot  this is when I turn to childhood thgs like Disney  musicals to  cheer me up but nothg has helped brg the magic back like the Harry  Potter books I am 21 years old a Universy student  have read  hundreds of books  my time but never have I longed f a books' release  as I have Harry PotterThis is a fantastic sumptious sty romantic  (yes love is  the air!) excg touchg  terribly sad you won't  be able to put  downThe best book out this year Un-put-downable
I read   six days I liked the end the most It was so surprisg I'd never have guessed   a million years I thought  would go  so many dferent directions  closed the book even me exced f number 5 than I was to receive number 4
I thk Harry Potter may well prove to be the fad diet of theNaughties: the moment I purchased &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet ofFire&quot   petty habs like eatg  sleepg  were put on the back burner until the last page had been turnedIt's  well known by now that Rowlg's prose draws you  (enchants you  you  will)  the fourth stallment  the series is no exception Never have  I had the pleasure to read a series that has gotten *consistently better*  wh each sequel not until Harry Potter that isAfter stayg up far  too late on the seventh ( would that be far too early on the eighth--?)  I stumbled out of bed  brought the newest book wh me to the gym  drawg some terestg looks from the folks around me as I kept my eyes  riveted to the pages stead of the treadmill readout My only regret is  that I couldn't contue to read  when I did my laps  the pool! =)Rest assured those who doubted that Rowlg has once aga surpassed  herself Not sce Roald Dahl have I enjoyed so-called &quotchildren's  books&quot so immensely Rowlg's dark sense of hum  knack f the  fantastic remd me of such classics as &quotThe Wches&quot   &quotMatilda&quot faves of me sce I was a young'n But curse the  woman f wrg so well --  takes me one day to read the books  a  year f the next to come out!Ah well That's what rereadg is f I  suppose
This book was the best book i have read  all of my 25 years  I started buyg them f my children but I enjoy them far me  The auth is unbeleivable  She brgs all the dferent plot twists together whout  gettg them jumbled  confused Defley buy this book  the other  three  I have read the others twice  wil start readg this one aga  as soon as i get  back from all my relative  Well done JK Rowlgs
This Book was Great! I LOVED  My Mother bought them f mybrother then my sis read the first one  told me i needed to read so i did  i have read everyone so Far  i am gog to pre der the next one  It is a great book  kids will love   has excement  gives  to a great imagation f kids ( Adults )!  was great especially how Ms Rowlg would give hts about what was gog to happen enough to nake you get exced but not enough to let you know what is gog to happen ! I LOVED  You Should read  But  der you will need to read the first three to underst everythg that hapens  the book!
I loved the new book  I read   four days  I want to s down  read  aga
By far JK Rowlg's best!  I was captivated the entire 700+ pages I cannot wa until book #5
I read this book  6 hours!  It was awesome  That was defietly the best book ever  I just wanted to read  over  over aga  You almost want to be there at Hogwarts You were always wag  on the edge of  your couch just tglg on what was gog to happen  As i read on through  the night I thought I would just crack  I didn't fish readg  That  book was some piece of wk  That was defietly the best
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of the greatest books of this century (Don't get me wrong I like Charlie  the Chocolate Facty too!)  However I like Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone better  Harry  meets many me people   then  the fourth one  But I'm supposed to  tell you about this one  Well let me put  this way  In this book there  is much me dark magic   tricate spells  To tell anyme would  spoil the sty
Zap!  Rowlg has once aga zapped her readers wh another amazg tale of Harry Potter  From the begng of Rowlgs latest masterpiece the reader is entrapped!  It is simply not enough to read one chapter because   is  the very first chapters that Rowlg sets the stage f this  engagg tale  She entices the reader to &quotread on&quot twistg   turng the plot always keepg the reader trigued  Just when the  reader might presume to know where Rowlg is headed she throws their  broom on a totally dferent course!  Fear not Muggles!  Rowlg has  defely strengthened her powers her wrg is better than ever   she leaves you at the end of this tale wishg f me!
I fished Goblet Of Fire  4 days !  I am 28 years old  a huge Harry Potter fan  This is the best book so far  JK Rowlg really develops the characters  addion to lettg them &quotgrow up&quot a b  I  couldn't believe  when I got to the last page - I wanted me !  Can't  wa f #5
I'm 12 years old  this is the best book I have ever read! I got  the saturday  was released  read  all by that same monday (3 days)  If you haven't already bought buy  now!
I thought this book was absolutly excellent but maybe not as good as the last 2 i'm not very good at givg reviews so my best  only advice is to read  's great Only thg i found was that seeg as these books  are focused at children the plot was rather complicated but over all  great f a good laugh
JK Rowlg has done  aga she has enthralled millionsof readers around the wld wh her previous Harry Potter books butthis one is by far the best I truly do not know how to put the way these books are wrten  wds except to say this- Rowlg is an amazg auth wh a talent like no other she thks of thgs you would never dream of  most of all she describes thgs puts together characters  wres a book like no other auth I know of Befe I read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire my fave book was Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secrets But now that I thk of  they are the same there's suspense emotion hum  w Those qualies  my opon are the thgs you need most  a book  Rowlg has them all down-pat JK  Rowlg is an extradary wrer  the Harry Potter books are credible There's no gettg around 
This book really is amazg  JK's books have me hooked- I can't put them down  The 4th one though has seemed to have gone up a ltle as far a the matury of the readers goes-  that is what the auth hted at As  a 15 year old I thk tht the Harry Potter books will be kd of like my  generation's Lion Wch  Wardrobe series  They also have a mal  lesson to them- like  said  the end about &quotchoosg between what  is right  what is easy&quot I am very eagerly wag f the 5th  book- ANY details about  are always welcome!  I hope you take the time to  really read her books  not just toss them off as &quotfantasy books f  children&quot  They are much me You can read as much to them as you  like- but no matter how much you do they're terric
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is an exg book whileHarry is enjoyg (yea right) his summer a letter arives from hirfriend Ron's mother vg Harry to the Qutich wld cup That night after the game death eaters (followers of you-know-who) terris muggles  the campg ground The dark mark suddenly apers  the sky  This book is great  you love unique ideas  chillg yet thrillg plots
How could she do this? I mean 734 pages filled wh imagation Wow
Harry potter 4 was a complete let down  I was expectg this book to be one of the best ever stead  was filled wh nothg but disappotments I have read all of the harry books  I unftunely have  to say that one book 1 was somewhat entertag  Thanks
I've read the first three Harry Potter books ofcourse  enjoyed them alot but  was this book that turned me to a Harry Potter fan!  No other auth than JK Rowlg could wre 734 pages wth of sty  have  kids fish   two days!  I love fat books  always prefer havg a  fantasy pages 400+ but even though I've read a lot of really good (  really fat) fantasies this is absolutely the first fat book to have NO  bg  slow  less than rivetg parts  this reads like a sht  sty  You don't even realize how long  is because everythg moves so  fast  What I love about Rowlg is that even though teens middle-aged  adults  older all are hooked by this book 's not because 's  &quottoo adult&quot f children but because  is beautully  &quotageless&quot
It's rather obvious that we all are  love wh this cute hero so I'll skip most of my oohs  aahhs except to say that thisbook took me less than a day to read (no lyg)  durg that time  was next to impossible f me to put  downBook 4 starts two weeks befe Harry's return to Hogwarts  Harry has awoken from a particularly vivid dream that makes his scar pa tremendously  The dream timates somethg about Ld Voldemt's return  a plan to kill Harry!Followg that event a number of similarly imptant  excg evets unfold  Harry's le  He gets to wness the Quiddch Wld Cup Fal wh the Weasley's become mixed up  a sister event that occurs there  gets entangled  a prestigious competion to be held at Hogwart's which has not happened  over a hundred years!  He Ron  Hermione discover romance  the dficulties  presents   the end there is a spectacular culmation of events that will leave you hangg onto this book f dear leAbout that person who dies  the end you might expect  you might not but I challenge you great mds out there to solve the even bigger mystery of who the tra at Hogwarts is befe  is unravelled f youThis book has  all: mystery fantasy trigue mals even a ltle b of romance thrown   I dare you once you've started to put  down  Some may crique the auth f the sheer size of the book  I'm 14  I adm  dwarfed me when I saw   However I doubt an ch of space was wasted  I love every square millimeterOh  f all those who really want to know - 's  this volume that you'll fd out some especially terestg details about Harry's  Ld Voldemt's tangled past  I wonder who's gog to Hogwarts 'Defence agast the Dark Arts' teacher next year  I'm still holdg out f Snape but I doubt 
Rowlg has done  aga Like the other 3 I could not put this book down It kept me gog I honestly can not say one bad thg about this book It keeps you guessg till the end  the whole end 's self is to  good I'm 20  I'm hooked to this books There's nothg wrong wh this  book all 700+ pages are well wth beg there
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is yet another excellentbook  the Harry Potter series  From s vivid scenes to the detailsabout characters this book is wth readg It takes readers  the imagary wld created by Rowlg  hungers the readers f the fth book  I loved readg this book  personally thk  is the best  the whole series  I fished   about two days  read  one me time just because I enjoyed s plot so much So everyone who hasn't read  yet go buy  this mute!
JK Rowlg has done  aga  This book is great  is even better than the first three  It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time  you don't want to put  down  At first when I found out there would be  no Quiddch (my fav part) I was kd of leery headg to   However  there was so much gog on  the book like the Triwizard Tournament   Harry's troubles wh girls I never noticed   Ms Rowlg did an  exceptional job of leavg you at the end  I can't wa f book five to  come out  see what Harry does next  It's great to see Harry Ron   Hermione grow up  become even closer friends  Here's to book 5!
This is the best book yet  the series It is excg on every page Rowlg is an extremely talented styteller wh an credible imagation  I fished the Goblet of Fire  was disappoted because  now I have to wa f the sequel Rowlg ties up lots of loose end only  to create so many questions f the next one I fully expect number 5 to be  the most excg HP book when  comes out What I love most is that my  students who hate to read  avoid readg are readg this book  lovg    Highly recommend almost any age
JK Rowlg contues to amaze me: who could have ever predicted that anybody would ever get children to read a book over 700 pages long?  I read  myself  a sgle stg one night  ended the book  a rage!  How  long am I gog to have to wa f the next one?  The books just keep  comg out at the same level of tense imagation  each one exceeds  my already high expectations from the last  As an aspirg wrer f  children  teenagers myself I can only hope the publishg wld wakes  up  realizes (as  used to back  the fties  sixties) that  children want to be challenged  amazed  I can hardly wa until my  3-year old daughter is old enough to have me read these to her  Ftunately that's only a few years away  And by then Ms Rowlg should  have all seven Harry Potter books fished  my daughter won't have to  wa like the rest of us!
JK Rowlg has added yet another rivetg sty to  the Harry Potter collection  Besides the terwoven sties of the pa of adolescence feelg dferent  the fear of meetg 'you-know-who' she contues to  develop what is truly her ma theme - the power of a parent's love  There  is a paragraph towards the end of the book that is so well wrten   poignant that  will brg tears to the eyes  There are also some very  entertag tidbs f adults such as Albus Dumblede's dark family  secret that are a complet riot  Buy   You be anxiously awag book  five when you're fished
Once me JK Rowlg delights readers across the wld whher spellbdg tales wonderful plot twists  abily to combedanger  drama wh a touch of hum  This fourth book has surpassed the stard her first three books have set Harry experiances many new thgs  feelgs durg his fourth year (cludg girls :) )  The reader is  f a treat wh this book!
The latest of the JK Rowlg series is a great adventure f all ages I plowed through the book  an sgle afternoon fascated by the unfoldg sty of Harry vs Voldemt the Tournament  the simple everyday  relationships between friends The characters are much me dynamic as is  the sty le While the subject matter is older  darker than the  earlier 3 novels this book is the best yet!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is by far JK Rowlgs best Harry Potter book  I do thk that this book may be too scary f younger children though!  This book is excellent  I give  FIVE Stars f a  reason!  BUY THIS BOOK NOW!

This has to be the best book  the sereis so far  This bookcontues through Harry Potters le at Hogwarts aga troducgnew obstacles f Harry to overcome  The characters have truly been brought to le  I couldn't put  down!  I stayed up til 1 AM Its truly mesmerisg  now i'm very anxious f the next book after readg this one  two days!  Highly reccomended to all ages but f the very young children  gets a ltle &quotdark&quot  they use a ty b me vulgar language but that should defely not st  the way of this enchantg book  You thought the other three books were excg?  Wa till you read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Truly thrillg!
This is an excellent book--I am enjoyg  very much!  Thecharacters are well-developed plot flows easily   seems as each chapter can be a sgle sty  I am already lookg fward to the next books  am gog to reread the earlier onesDefly buy all of the Harry Potter books--they are spellboundg!
Let me make  perfectly clear - I thoughly enjoyed book 4 ofthe Harry Potter books  My fave so far is &quotHarry Potter the Scerer's Stone&quot I thk that is because everythg was so new  feign  Potter's wld that I delighted  everythg&quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot held me rapted from begng to end  I could hardly wa f the Triwizard Tournament to beg  Rowlg is great at keepg the suspense le gog as well as wonderful at wrappg up all the loose ends of her sties  She has a marvelous way of creatg the most special of wldsSo why do I ask who IS Harry Potter?  Because at the age of fourteen I have been wag f him to mature  At the begng of the book he seemed to me to be que a child yet  Then there were times he acted me adult than most adults (which is nmal f many teens :)) but I never really get of sense of who Potter is anyme  Is he a geek a jock a nerd an academic a mystic  spirualist?  He is almost bl perhaps that's the pot  I'm too thick to get   I wouldn't md him beg bl but then he does this marvelous stuff - how?Anyway I would love to see him developed further preoccupied wh girls/boys - whichever     hang' wh the guys    out dog some flyg just f the fun of      really gettg hooked to somethg (spells charms transfigurations)  have him cry This would have been the year to do     but stead he wasn't allowed - po Harry not allowed to enjoy the motherg he seeks  Ah wellStill all  all I wolfed down the book  a few days  enjoyed myself immmencelySigned an ardent fan
Harry Potter has done  aga  I couldn't put  down until Iwas fished---an at over 700 pages that's sayg somethg  Nonstop action wh connectg sty les that are not stretched f credibily An action sty f everyone that ends wh good triumphg over evil but leaves suspence set up f the next book
I loved the book  Its my most fave one yet  I have toknow what happens to Harry next When will the 5th book be ready toder?
I found the descriptions too wdy  Readg to my son who is 8 he often got lost  the dialogue  He couldn't believe Mrs Weasley went on  on f over two pages when she found out about Gege's  Fred's busess  My son asked &quotIs she still talkg about the same thg?&quot  All  the back--fth banter  all the adverbs describg everyone's speech  were just too much One rett was described &quotguffawed  sycophantically&quot Really?  Yes I thought  was pretty good
I thought that this book was the best of the four to datehowever I felt that especially  light of the cricisms from the&quotright&quot - Rawlgs could have substuted her use of &quotdamn&quot f another less controversial wd  This appeared several times  the text  I thought that teachers readg this book aloud to their classes may stumble over      addion one part has a wizard refusg to wear &quotmuggle&quot trousers because he likes to feel the wd &quotbetween his privates&quot - I'm no prude but I hardly thk this is appropriate f the lower ages experiencg this seriesI also was a b disappoted wh the begng - I look fward to how Harry is gog to give the Dursley's their comeuppance befe gog off to Hogwarts  This one didn't deliver as the other three did on that potAll  all the sty was deeper  me volved darker richer  me satisfyg Several plot developments easily lend themselves to the next  the series (SPEW f example was never resolved)  At this pot  the Harry Potter phenomenon a good  bad review will not make much dference  I'm elated that 9  10 year olds (on summer holiday no less) are trudgg a tome of over 700 pages  That  self is truly amazg
It did not come as a surprise when I fished this book told myself: &quotanother good one!&quot Joanna Kathleen Rowlg hasimpressed me aga wh a new pletha of excg colful characters  this fourth addion to the Harry Potter series This review of course must be one of thouss posted on Amazon by the end of the summer - the populary of these books is astoundg Yet aga an excg read exhibg Rowlg's flexibily as an auth My only regret is that this sty ended a b bluntly but  is a series after all Each book makes the next better Of course the books do not need my help to be showered wh praise - I am just one of the masses Congratulations Ms Rowlg! You have redefed fantasy adventure comedy  tragedy Cheers!
I only have book:3  book:4  I love the Harry Potter books They're long creative  fun to read I'm 13  I like to take the books everyhere I go  the car long/sht trips  even to the library! Ithk they're great f kids  adults we need me books like  Harry  Potter!
I bought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the day  cameout  f the next two days until I fished  I experiencedmystery great suspense magic  an overall great sty This is by far the best book  the series because this sty is me excg  even a ltle scary!  JK Rowlg manages to ject some hum to the sty as well That's not to say that the others aren't all these thgs too! The first 3 books are also some of the best I have ever read They just keep gettg better  better! I can't wa until the fth one comes out!
This book was credible! I got the book about five days early Canada but so what? This book was wrten wh great lerarystyle   is the best Harry Potter book so far The adventure was so thrillg the details so realistic I couldn't put  down lerally! The book filled  blanks f new readers yet was not so familiar  would be the old readers  Sce Joanne Rowlg seems to wre a better one every time this won't be the best f long Keep wrg Ms Rowlg we'll be eagerly wag!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was one of the best booksI have EVER read period  The only other thg I can say is: BUY IT!
When I first heard about Harry Potter books gog skyhigh terms of fame I was bemused I was shocked that a CHILD's book hadbeen on the bestseller list f such a long time  the #1 spot My friend Rae gave the book to me  demed that I read  I did  I loved  Mrs  Rowlg is superb at masterg the subtle nuances that Roald Dahl was famous f She knows how to hold a reader to the book I thouroughly enjoyed this book  suggest  to everyone even haughty imperious  tellectual women like myself Go out  read  now! You won't regret  I promise!
Absolutely fantastic! I am a 49 year old adult who enjoys good leraturewrten f adults  childrenperiod This book certaly qualies It is the most tense book of the series  s 734 pages was  anythg but long I've read books wh less than 300 pages that seemed  like virtual tomes compared to the Goblets of Fire A pure delight from  begng to end Now a recommendation you enjoy this st of  fantasybe you adult  childread anythg wrten by John Bellairs  I discovered his books over 10 years ago  until Ms Rowlg appeared on  the scene few wrers ( my opion) had come close to attag the  level of telligent  entertag sty tellg as John Bellairs  Unftunately Mr Bellairs died a few years ago but he has left a large  number of his wks behd Any of them will be well wth your timeThey  are all much shter  length than the Harry Potter series which may  appeal to some readers  are all available  paperbackmuch less  expensive Take a look why don't you? You won't be sry
I was not so impressed wh the third book  the series but Goblet of Fire was a very pleasant surprise  What I most liked was that everythg was not all wrapped up  a tidy ltle endg  There was some questions  that remaed to look fward to  the book 5  You can tell that the  upcomg books are just gog to build up to the ultimate good vs evil  battle  I can't wa f #5
I LOVE THIS BOOK!  Rowlg has done  aga  I'm 16 years old my mom (I love you mom) bought this book f me the Saturday came out  I got home at 9:30 from wk  laid on my bed  read  read  read  read until about 5:30 am Sunday when I realized that I'd have to get up  two hours to go to church  I still had about 50 pages left  It takes us 2 hours to get to church  I fished the book wh the first hour  Harry's adventures as he goes to his first Quiddch Wld Cup game  survives his first year at Hogwarts are endlessly hilarious  frighteng  Surprises at every turn Rowlg leaves all readers beggg f the next book If you don't have  buy   If you haven't fished stop cleang your house  fish  If you're just a kid fce your parents to read you at least two chapters a night!
Who said Harry Potter is just f kids?  I'm a 27 year old professional woman who just so happens to be a die-hard fan of the most imagative wrer J K Rowlg!  My 9 year old brother got me hooked on Harry  Potter so when Book 4 came out we had a race to see who could fish   first (he won)  In this book Harry becomes even me approachable   admirable  You feel sry f him when his friends turn agast him  (except f the ever-fahful  practical-mded Hermione a girl after  my own heart! ) you cheer him on as he completes the dauntg tasks put  befe him  the Triwizard tournament you pray f him when You-Know-Who  fally carries out his threats  reveals himself  a most frighteng  way!  I was on the edge of my seat tryg to figure out WHO was betrayg  Harry at Hogwarts  Image my surprise when  turned out to be     (don't wry I'm not gog to ru  f you!)  It's so great that kids  have somethg to look fward to other than video games  TV shows  Parents suppt your children's quest f imagation!  Harry Potter is an  excellent role model f the next generation  a great example of  heroism maly tolerance  devotion  So when does Book 5 come  out?
As an adult reader  elementary school teacher I read the first book  the series after my students told me  was the best book After one book I was totally hooked on Harry I had never even read fantasy until this  series but  is credible! This book is by far Rowlg's best  well  wth the read I read   3 days  even stayed up well to the  mng to fish  My only disappotment was that Rowlg had said she  was killg  imptant character  after readg the book I was  disappoted to see that  didn't happen If you haven't read the other  three start there first  then read this And  you're a parent who is  hesant to let your kids read  don't be There's nothg evil  these  books  they are gettg kids who don't read to readg!
this is crazy  is like the best book  the wld I am  high school  i thought i would never get back to readg books but this did the trick
OK I see my ltle sister strugglg to read harry potter number 1  say to myself self you should help her wh that so i read her the first chapter the next day I fd myself deeply enthroled  Harrys Struggle  to figure out what the hell the CHAMBER  OF SECRETS is The Harry Potter  Books are so good that on my way out to dner one day I can Barely put  down So all  all I feel that all people should enjoy these books See ya   Hogsmeade we can share a butterbeer
This book is just amazg From an auth that used to wrewh the bare necesies she had to an extremely wealthy person 'sgreat!
Eagerly awag JK Rowlg's fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series I was not disappoted  On first sight the novel would seem timidatg by s 700+ pages  Not to wry  The pages fly by the  action is swt the sty entertag   some stances funny   her descriptions keep the reader locked to the sty not strayg away   wonderg what's f dnerThe &quotbad guys&quot  the sty  keep the suspense movg right along right up to the end  Malfoy the  contuous thn  Harry's side is as deliciously malicious as ever   there are many plot twists  turns to keep the reader on the edge of  his/her seatRowlg has done a magnicent job  developg characters  - all the way down to the descriptions of each  how the characters react  to each other  I am particularly fond of Ron's ty owl  &quotPig&quot  (sht f Pigwidgeon) who remds me of an over-exced puppy that is so  pleased wh himself f gettg to do a job that he piddles all over the  flo  Pigwidgeon doesn't piddle but his overexcement is obviousAll   all &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot was a very  enjoyable read  JK Rowlg does a good job of explag a few  &quotside thgs&quot to readers who may not be familiar wh them   doesn't stray from the sty  dog soI'm only sad because the sty  ended  I have to wa f Harry Potter to spend his summer at the  Dursley's befe I can read about his 5th year  What a sensation these  books have turned out to be!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful example ofchildren's fantasy  one of my all-time faves JK Rowlg issimply amazg she always keeps me thkg  you never know what you're gog to expect The sty goes like this:Harry Potter is a wizard--trag who is well-known f a tagic accident that he survived but his parents didn't He goes to one of the the magic-teachg school called Hogwarts  Engl This year a Triwizard Contest is takg place where 3 students (one from each of the 3 maj magic schools) are chosen from a Goblet of Fire to compete f The Triwizard Cup The Goblet mysteriously chooses Harry Potter's name to compete The rest of the book is about Harry  the contest  an unplanned confrontation wh Voldemt- the most feared Dark Wizard This is an unfgetable book that cannot be missed Just make sure to read the 3 other Harry Potter books first I'm sure you'll love   become another Harry fan!*Due to the populary of these books many younger kids have read them They are very good books f most everyone but I have to adm they can be kda scary I suggest that children under 9 should read  wh their parents  wa till they are older This is a wonderful  fantastic read as long as you undert that  is all fantasy Have Fun Readg!
I first got this book when  came out I spent five days readg  When I fished on the fth day I was really sad #1 I was sad because on of my fave characters ( I'm not sayg who will spoil the fun)was  killed by stupied Ld Voldemt#2 It was a REALLY good book so I wanted  like a thous me pages to read I don't recommend this book to people  who haven't read the three Harry Potter books because you'll be very  confused I was when I first started the book I had to remember what I  read  the other books f this book to make any sense But 's still  excellent besides the fact there are eight curse wds  the book In  Harry Potter  the prisoner of Azkaban there were only four! So be  prepared to be scaredhappymad  sad because of all the stuff that  happedn  the book It might even make you cry!
Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire seems to be the pivotalchapter of the Harry Potter series  It seems that evrythg  theprevious 3 books leads up to the conlusion of book 4  I will not reveal the conclusion but  seems JK Rolg has now set up the plot f the next 3 books  She has also hted that the next 3 will be darker  judgg from this one I believe her  I am 14 years old  I love the Harry Potter series  I love the characters  atmosphere of the novels  I hope they each get longer as I sav each one  each endg leaves me cravg f me  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire fleshes out the chatacters even me  they mature beautuly  I could relate to their emotions  suationd beg as I am the same age as the characters are depicted  I espcially like the premise of the crushes among the students  the Yule Ball chapter was brilliant  I am surprised JK Rowlg isn't 14  All  all Harry Potter  the Goblet  Fire is the best  the series yet (though  didn't have the amazg twist endg of book 3)  I hope  contues  the darker directions the endg hts at  (Parents wh younger children beware this is a MUCH me mature book then the previous ones  deals wh mature themes as racism fascism genocide tabloids polics boyfriends/girlfirends  murder Though these themes are presented  a way of showg what is right  wrong some of the darker scenes may firghten young children  I suggest any parent who is considerg buyg the book f a child under the age of 8  9 read the first chapter befe makg a decision  The first 3 are A-ok though) END
When I read &quotThe Scerer's Stone&quot I was enthralled  When I went on to read the followg two books I felt that  just got better  better: b by b the Universe of Harry Potter became richer wh new addional characters  well developed sty lesThat is why  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot was kd of a disppotment: Rowlgs starts  many new threads but doesn't fully develop any of themI would have  liked this book much better  50% of the new stuff had been removed but  the other 50% had been developed further  So while still a nice book to  read book #4 does not come close to s elder siblgs  What a py
i have just fished readg the newest harry potterbook(goblet of fire) the booked kept me trigued the whole time ididnt know what to expect i liked how the auth kept us  suspense the whole way i liked this book from the other 3 this book shows the emotions of the characters  a whole new perspective  shows harry's bravery  how he's mature beyond his years s a book f all ages i love the book i give  2 thumbs up!
i've always thought the whole harry potter craze was a load of rubbish but they improve on you the book is wth readg  not buyg  moderately amusg
JK Rowlg broke the mold  many dferent ways by wrgthis book It has to be the longest childrens book ever 's her mostthought-vokg book yet (not many new books actually make you thk)   doesn't follow the common fantasy mold of hero discovers plot hero  friends try to end the plot hero  friends get  serious trouble hero  friends turn out all right  everythg ends feThis was the best Harry Potter book yet wh many new suations f Harry  his friends to deal wh It starts out wh Harry at the Dursleys when he gets an vation from his wizard friends the Weasleys to see the Quiddch wld cupAll--all this was Rowlg's best book maly because she didn't follow her previous fmulaBy the way  you thought that I was some English teacher I'm actually only 13 years old
What can I say?  I read the entire book over the course of an eveng  the followg afternoon  As heavy as the 734 pages are I could not put  down  I am 24 years old  just as entranced  enchanted by Harry  Potter  his friends as my 9 year old nephew  The books were a gt from  my mother who is also a caught up  Harry fever If you have young  children read this to them  Let them read  to you  Eher way make  sure you pick up a copy  This book answers lots of questions but leaves  you wonderg what will happen next  I f one can't wa f book 5
In real le friendships change  Harry Hermione  Ronface new challenges together ( apart) durg their fourth year atHogwarts  They face problems that take their knowledge of magic to a whole new level  Don't be ready to thk you know exactly what's comg next  Most likely you'll be wrong  A new teacher--is he the trouble maker  is Snape still causg problems?  Rums of He-who-must-not-be-named also brg terestg twists  problems You'll be surprised  This book keeps your attention  keeps movg leavg you to wish the next book was already published
I loved this book so much I read the entire thg  one dayIread until 11:00 PM  then tried to go to sleep but gave up started readg aga at 2:00  It's really great although  falls to the same pattern as all the other booksAnyway READ THIS BOOK!
I made  last five days  Some of you may not thk that islasted  But I could of read   a day  I wanted toI thkthis book is probably the best book  the series  The followg are reasons I enjoyed :The endg was very suprisg like the first bookIt had a lot of violence like the second bookYou learned a lot of stuff about thgs havg to do wh Voldemt  Harry Potter like the third bookThis book wasn't as f children as the other books are  (But still this is okay f most children)--------------- I was sad Harry didn't get to play Quiddch but the Tri-Wizard Tournament was terestgThe middle was a ltle drawn-out but the end made up f I am me of a mystery reader but this is a great adventure novelI'm fished but I really don't know why I typed a review 's not as  my review is gog to make you buy this book wh all the other thouss of reviews-a teenager
This book is credible the way the auth always has exg thgs gog on  How everythg is so magical  It's AWESOME!
this book was the best book I have ever read i fished   a week  could never put  down  i can't wa f the 5th book to come out
Harry Potter books  general have changed my le These books are full of imagationhum  w JK Rowlg should defatly be awarded somethg special  Many claim the same thg happens  each book: Harry  starts wh the Dursleys  ends up beatg Voldemt aga JK still  has not failed to surprise me  every paragraph she wres  In  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot there was a constant  feelg that I was one of them that I deed were a wch  attendg  Hogwarts fearg Snape ( You-Know-Who)   of course awg at Vickt  Krum  I believe an acual school should be built  called Hogwarts Of  course they will teach muggle accademics  but all the same will be as  magical  mistical as the acual Hogwarts that is live  vivid  our  mds  My teacher had taught me that a capalized letter means a  &quotproper&quot noun that desirves respect That beg the case I will  end this ratg wh two wds:HARRY POTTER
I read this book  a matter of days(2)  I couldnt put the book down(same wh the first 3) Now after i fnished this book i thought to myself&quot why didnt you take longer to read the whole thg because now  i have a longer wa until the next comes out&quot When i found out the  series was gog to end at #7 i wanted to not believe   thk that  JK Rowlg would wre 20 me!
This book keeps any reader who starts  hooked to the very end  I fished my copy of the book  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  less than 3 days  The only I stopped was to eher eat  sleep  go to my soccer game When  is fished  leave many questions  of what will happen  book 5 left  the readers thoughts Muggle  not  you are sure to love this book
I bought the book the day  came out  I fished  that day That's how good  was All 734 pages kept me on the edge of my seat  I CAN'T wa f the next one! Please wre fast Ms Rowlg!
This book is one of the best I have ever read I am absolutely fascated by Rowlg's imagation This woman must be a wizard herself to be able to create  her head as tricate a wld as the wld of Harry Potter My friends  I are all fasated wh  I dered the fourth one about 5 months befe  came out I am so exced f the fth one to come out Hurry Up JK Rowlg!  We are all wag f another adventure!

I especially lovefantasy books  I thought I had read all the greats That is until I got my hs on the first Harry Potter book! I could not put  down  went out  bought numbers two  three Along wh all the rest of muggles I avidly awaed book four I had some preconceptions but readg the book erased them immediatly Clearly one of the most engrossg books ever wrten I could not put  down!Beggng darkly  a settg of Ld Voldemt's old home along wh Wmwood concoctg death f all that is good Soon the plot le travels to Harry who dreams of Voldemt  contacts Sirius one of the most terestg characters  a tale wh many vivid onesHarry travels to the quiddch wld cup where ron gets to some trouble wh a veela  learns looks are not everythg  onto one of the darker moments of the book where  seems Ld Voldemt is reawakengWhen Harry returns to Hogwarts he learns of the Tri-wizard tournament  is terested  the proceedg However Harry is not keen on beg  the competion never expectg the effects  would have on his leLet us flash fward to the most hilarious part of the book when Ron fally figures out that Hermione on of the few ma girl characters  the book is actually a girl  gets madly jealous The hilary of  is Ron himself has no idea he feels this way f Hermione  Harry has to tell him!There were many jokes  this book but the endg was so extremely dark  unexpected as to totally make up f all the jokes The villian was completely unexpected as was the way the endg happened  you are left wag breathlessly f the fth book!
I'm a bookwm I know when books are good  when they are bad And that book was the best!  When the Harry Potter book came out I got  real quick When I read that book I was so happy to have somethg to read I  read  day  night a thg like that was just to good to put down  Its really exg  you read the 4th book first I suggest that you read  the 1st one first though so you know where  takes place who the  characters are  just whats gog on
This is the best one!  I am one of the people AMAZONCOM upgraded to next day Fed Ex so I got my book on the 8th fished  on the 9th!  This Harry Potter adventure starts  ends  action  delight!  If you  haven't read this seriesget onle  buy yourself a set!  This is a  st alone novel but  is much me fun knowg the people from Books  12  3!  The characters are well drawn  fun to get to know better  The sties are always great but the TriWizard Contest  this novel is  outstg!  Harry has to deal wh his Muggle relatives his  relationships wh his best friends  wst enemies AND try to stop  Valdemt from gag power  destroyg the good  the wld!  Whew--que a job f a 14 year-old but Harry  Rowlgs are up to   Buckle up  enjoy the ride!
This is the best Harry Potter book yet  It is very excg fascatg  appealg to older  younger readers  It is long enough to keep you busy but  never gets bg  You will not want to put  down
Here ss a 36 year old mother who fished the book befe her 10 year old daughter (barely) To say the least we both were completely enthralled from begng to end  Were we tempted to skip to the end to fd out  which proment character died (which Rowlg &amp the publisher has  alluded to recently)? No We wanted to follow the sty as  unfolded  Rowlg is truly up to stards  this 4th book of the series  as  wh the previous 3 books (which my daughter required me to read  the  days leadg up to this book's release) there is a plot twist at the end  that you cannot even beg to predict no matter how much you try Who's  the bad guy? Don't bother tryg to guess Rowlg will catch you off guard   the end  I just wish these books weren't comg out at an average  of once every 2 years! I'm eagerly awag f the 5th stallment  Rowlg does an excellent job of tyg up this book's sty but leavg  you hungry f me  These books are wonderful  teachg right  from wrong good triumphg over evil mal courage etc I highly  recommend this book f anyone strong enough to hold  their hs!
It never ceases to amaze me how J K Rowlg can wre superibook after superi book  Wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fireshe has done  agaThe extent of her imagation is truly md bogglg  In this book all of the old fave characters return However this time Rowlg gives them even me depth  The Hogwarts gang is startg to grow up- their characters  the suations that they face are me complexWhat I am most pleased about ( I don't want to give anythg away here) is the fact that Rowlg really ups the ante by the end of the fourth book  The tone changes slightly the stakes are higher  Rowlg leaves us wh the feelg that Books 5 6  7 still have plenty  ste f us
I hope JKRowlg makes the 5th one fast  I 'd died I readthe book  7 days  I put down 10 times to sleep  restroombreaks
Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire was an excellent book It had much to live up to wh the attention  got from the media   surpassed all expectations I was defetly impressed wh the wrg  this book  right from the begng you are hooked! The Quiddch Wld cup is  brilliantly described  is where the danger begs f our fave hero  After survivg the rather unusual events that followed the match Harry  returns to Hogwarts f his fourth year Dumblede sprgs a surprise upon  the students wh an announcement which turns Harry's wld upside down f  the school year (I will not reveal what the announcement is you'll have to  read  to fd that out!) Over the followg semesters Harry plunges to  me danger  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named(Voldemt) awas his chance to  rise aga The endg to this book is full of excement  leaves you  achg f the next book Also  this book we fd Harry a ltle me  grown up  discover his feelgs f a particular Hogwarts student F  those who have not read Harry Potter befe I suggest you start Fans of  the first three Harry Potter books will be impressed wh this new  very  excg stallment  the already popular series
Not many books trest me but this one is the best book I have ever read It was so good that I stayed up till 1:00  the mng just readg All 4 of the books were beond excellent I thk #4 was the best of all of them so farThis book is truly magical!
This book is wonderful from cover to cover! True 's longbut the length is barely noticeable once you start! You will NOTregret buyg this book!
I was so exced when I got this book I started readg   fished   one  a half days It has many mixed emotions It also has the potensial of a mystery If you like mystery  danger this book is f  you It is very suspensg  surprisg
She has done  aga  The fourth book of the series is wonderfully wrten How could anyone see anythg bad  the series  Harry is a great character  wh me terestg freds {new  old}  My son knows  every book front to back This is a large undertakg 752 pages f any  child but  was accomplished  a mere 36 hours by my son  We now awa  the fth book  It will be even better because new characters have been  added me thgs have been explaed   glimpses of thgs we do not  know yet
This is the best ( longest) Harry Potter book yet  They get better  longer as the series progresses  I'm sure I shan't be the only one  tears after the release of the seventh book  This book felt dferent from  the other three somehowalso less complete because (WARNING:  all you  slow readers who have not yet fished  don't read the maj spoiler to  come) a me-powerful-than-ever Voldemt was still at large by the end of  the book  My fave part was when Malfoy got turned to a ferret-THAT  was terestg!  Heh heh heh (:::grs evilly:::)  The end was me  shockg than that of &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot!  It took me just  under eight hours to read this latest stallment-startg just after  midnight stoppg only to pour me cherry seven up I'm serious  about that  The house could have burned down  I'd have yelled at the  fire f stoppg me  the middle of this rivetg read  If my room had  flooded my glare would have evapated the water gettg my book wetbut  enough about that  Does anyone know of someone  Pacic time who  fished the book befe like 7:55  7:58 AM on the release date? E-mail  me  you do- sailgirl615@sailmooncom
I am always lookg f books that take me away from my busy le  let me be a kid aga J K Rowlg has given us a wonderful tale This book is even better than the first three Everyone is back plus a few new  characters Just when you thk you have  all figured out the plot twists  aga Now the long wa f Book 5 This might be a b scary f very  young children but wh proper parental guidance there should be no  nightmares   Buy this book  read !
This is the longest darkest   greatest book ever wrten by RowlgYou will fd action fightg romance  drak dirty secretsI thk this is a must read bookI feel( this is what i feel but im not  tellg you to )this book should be read by everyoneThe plot is never  endgI mean really she still at the end leaves the plot wide open to make  an awesome sequalShe makes you want the fth book to come outSo please  read these books  you will see you will like them
This book is great Wh most books  i saw that they were 734 pages long i would say i'm not gog to read this  but harry potter books are mysterious  take you right  wh the well decribed charects   seniy Buy this book  is great
Why do they keep sayg these books are f children?  I am 38  I totally loved every one of them  This book was Awsome!  It was a lot darker than the other three  As a teacher I'm not sure that I would read  this one to my class  My 11 year old son fished   5 days  He  couldn't put  down  I love seeg kids exced about readg aga!  When will the next one be published?  I can't wa
This book was so amazg that I actually read   1night Yes 1 night It was very well wrten  a must read feveryone even  you haven't read Harry Potter befe I don't want to ru  so I'll just say that is about Harry growg up  all the troubles he faces
Are you a kid? Then you'll love  Are you below 100 years old? You'll love  (The only people who wouldn't love this amazg book are the ones who go to an Ivy League school  maj  fe lerature f the fun of  makg fun of children's books maybe Harry Potter is not  &quotlerature&quot to those types of people but 's a classic epic   s own class) So HARRY potter is like Star Wars wh me terest   magic Anyway I'd rather read a classic than &quotfe lerature&quot  because i believe that most of us don't enjoy ALL the books we read   school By the way we must wre to the auth  compla that the wd  &quotcool&quot is too American Has anyone but me noticed how she tries  to throw  American slang   how  sounds totally awkward  such a  Br-soundg book? She's embarrassg us Americans  wre  tell her  to stop tryg to be an American-wannabe That is all Thank you f  listeng  cheers! Lakers rule   Harry Potter does too
i loved this book  like every one eles i fshed   like3  4 days some people i have heard say 's not f ltle kids butthats why 's f the ages of 9  up  does have some dark parts that would be scary f younger children   you do have younger children that want to read harry potter you could read  to them your-self that way  you thk there is a part that is to scary f them you could just skip   make somethg up less scary thats what me  my husban did f are 2 ltle boysbut i thk this is a wonderful book just like the other 3 books jk  rowlgs has some very good talent on her hs to have wrote these book which she has proven to us all you have not read any of the harry potter books then DON'T read the 4th one first of all you will not underst  as well caues there is alot of thgs that come up from the other three book you need to read the first ones becaues there just to good to miss out on  fact  is so good that im gog to go  read  aga  good-bye  thank you
Wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire JK Rowlg has delivered a feast f the true Harry Potter fan  Once aga as  her previous books the auth draws the reader  on the first page keepg him under her spell  through the volume's 37 chaptersThis book further chronicles the le  of boy-wizard Harry Potter who attends Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry  often fds himself suations  As Harry contues his  fourth year at the school he becomes volved  the Triwizard Tournament  goes on his first date  meets other young wizards from around the  wld  In this book as  the previous three Rowlg fills  the gaps  of Harry's knowledge ( the reader's)of his past but leaves us  enough  suspense to wonder what could possibly happen nextThis book cetaly  exceeded my expectations which were already high  Wh the other books  beg as great as they were  was hard f me to believe the auth could  outdo herself  The sheer size of the book is a treat  self although  the real treasure lies side s covers  Havg learned from experience  my fiance  I purchased two copies ensurg no fights would ensue over  who got to read  firstOne can only hope that Rowlg has enough house  elves to help her wh her daily ches such as cookg   cleanganythg to keep her wrg so book five will arrive that much  faster!
I don't see what is so special about this Harry Potter book  Dry Brish humour  weird names just didn't do  f me  I'd skip this  I were you
Once aga J K Rowlg has enchanted us of all ages wh her Harry Potter Book IV  However as a dedicated Hogwarts watcher I was mystied to see that Harry's father's image appeared befe Lily Potter when the  brother ws met creatg the Reversal Curse  It was my understg  from previous books  the series that James Potter was killed by Ld  Voldemt (I like Harry  Dumblede believe  statg his name)  BEFORE he killed Harry's mum!  Therefe shouldn't Lily have appeared to  Harry BEFORE James?  Just a b of trivia f the HP devotees!  It  no  way stopped me from devourg the book  lookg fward to many  re-reads as well as listeng to the audiotapes while I impatiently awa  Book V
Ok so i might be over 9  gog on 14 but i still love thisbook  i thk that you people should buy  i read all 734 pages one day becuase i was so hooked on the amazg sty le i thk i must have laughed out loud me than 11 times becuas of the histerical thgs that some of the people say  the book once  twice toward the end i cried(who wouldn't)  i am really bothered that i don't know the next date f the publishg of the 5th book the person who i thank the most at this moment is jkrowlg f creatg this lovely fantasy f me!
Often sequels don't hold a cle to the books that preceed them  This is an exception to the rule  Rowlg has done yet another excellent job of followg up great wh better than great  Whout givg the plot away  Harry is aga faced wh danger to overcome that does not step anywhere  near the realm of monotony  Rowlg's imagation is boundless   unpredictable every chapter leaves you chompg at the b f what's  comg  the next one  New characters are troduced to a seamless  genre developed  adhered to by all four books  The characters that we  already know rema true to their natures yet are every b as  unpredictable as they have ever been  The auth has aga masterfully  blended human motivation hum trigue suspense  imagation  a  700+ page book you'll wish was double  size If you haven't read the  previous three Rowlg does an excellent job of referencg  briefly  explag occurrences  all previous books so you're not left wonderg   not too elabately to be you  you have  However missg out on  the first three books  just readg this one is a fm of  self-deprivation I would not recommend  F the moment I'm glad Harry's  adventures have paused f a year  there was a new Harry Potter book  released once a week I'd never get any wk done Enjoy!
Wow THat is all I have to say about &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot It is as good as all 3 of the books combed! In the book Harry faces new adventures he learns me thgshe faces new  challenges as well And he just turns his personaly so much It is so  excg readg about what will happen to him nextthis book is  seriously a page-turner Yeah Once you open to read you just can't stop!  Harry has a like a whole new personaly  this book He faces so many  thgs that could kill him yet he managed to survive (amazg eh?) Well  I hope you all read the book: Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire It is  truely an amazg  awesome book Very treasurable )
I couldn't wa f the Harry Potter's Book 4 to come out Itwas excellent! I loved the characters the plot  It is so wellwrten- you don't read the Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire you Live ! It took me 3 days to fish the over 700 pages  I still wanted me Fantastic wrg!
This is of course another WONDERFUL Harry Potter  book  It is captivatg  a ltle scary  places  JK Rowlg did  aga  If you've read the first three Harry Potter books then you MUST read this  one  I can't wa until book 5 comes out!
I have been a fan of the series f que some time now  I feel I should tell everyone who reads this that this book is essential to the plot  Wh 's great descriptions  the gr stytellg of  JKRowlg this book comes to le  front of your eyes  It makes you  want to stay up all night to fish   I can only tell you that you would  very pleased to take a ltle time out of your busy schedule to read these  books
This book was the BEST  the series so far You need to figure out what special thg will happen at Hogwarts this year that hasn't happened  over 100 years! And what will become of Harry  Cho Chang? What about all  of the elfs? Will they stick up f themselves like Hermoe wants them to?  Fd out when YOU read the book
This book is the best of the series! (How come i keep sayg that?) Though  contas over 700 pages i never wanted  to be over The sty is as good as always the characters  relationships grow deeper  humany  shes on each  every page I wish i had these books when i was a kid  so i could have had the time to read them over  over aga Thank you  jk rowlg f excg my spir  awakeng my imagation
&quotGoblet of Fire&quot is by far the longest  mostcomplex of the Harry Potter series not to mention the darkest--whichis why 's also the best  JK Rowlg is clearly seekg an older audience ( me likely is mdful that adults as well as children devour Harry's adventures)  the result is a novel that has some genuely hric scenes  At times 's almost as  Rowlg hed the manuscript over to Clive Barker  said &quotHere why don't you have a go at ?&quot Parents of ltler Muggles may want to take a look at the book befe passg  on--although 's not graphic there is me violence  this than the other books  there is some mild profany mostly the d-wd  F older fans this will be but a whettg of the appete f Book 5  Rowlg is on top of her game (some of the descriptions of the Quiddch Wld Cup game are hysterically funny while the darker moments namely the trials of those volved wh He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named are exquisely poignant)  only promises to get better  F once the product justies the hype!
Yesssss 's hard to believe but 's true When Cho Changgets mentioned f the first time  the Harry Potter books I jumpedup  screamed 'cuz my name really is Cho Chang (actually Cholyn Chang but I go by Cho)  Anyway about the book When I read on Amazoncom that  was 734 pages I thought  was a typo but I read  a Newsweek article that  really was 734 pages long  let me tell you those 734 pages are some of the best  all of the series from the bizarre first chapter to the suspenseful endg I hate people who spoil sties f me so I won't tell you anythg but that you should read  (I especially liked JK Rowlg complimentg my lookshee hee)
I had wk the weekend that the book came out  I fished   less than two days  It was that good  J K Rowlgs has created an unbelievable wld around Harry Potter  I can't wa until book 5 is out
A longer better stronger at least as fun Harry Potter book wh me excement another puzzle  a ltle me revelation fo why Harry is so special  the wld of magic  Voldemt himself makes a much stronger  appearance  this book than he has befe  his battle wh Harry is as  tense to read as Harry's b of trouble wh the basilisk  the  &quotChamber of Secrets&quot  Harry Ron Hermione  friends seem to  be growg up a ltle quicker than they ought wh the timg of the books  ~  fact one of the few complats i had about &quotGoblet&quot is that  Harry seems to vary  age from thirteen to fteen  rather uncerta  fashion wh the sgle year the book encompasses  Certaly the  preoccupations of teenage years most especially the oppose gender have  taken a me proment posion  this book than previously  Once aga  Rowlg's characters are wh their wld entirely believable  their  actions  reactions both as predictable  unpredictable as real  people  this is f me the truest test of a book  Unlike many other  fads  must-haves ~ Pok&eacutemon sprgs to md ~ the latest Harry Potter  book is wth all the kerfuffle  fuss  has caused
Yes you heard me I'm 13 years old  I've read all the Harry Potter books I've liked them sce I read the first few chapters of the first one I've upheld my recd of fishg all the books wh 3 days And  I loved  I couldn't put  down I went to sleep readg   woke  up likewise I believe this is the best Harry Potter book yet-- Full of  surprises action  hum I'm not que sure what's so excg about  these books Maybe 's the fact that  tells  such detail thgs we  can't do wh beg Muggles  all But whatever  is this book is full  of  I recommend this book to everyone!
This book was a great read I myself bought the book f my kid  spent the next two hours readg my boy the most excg book of the year This book has adventure dancg  suspense even romance I recomend this  sty f anyone who wants to read about Harry Potter  his amazg le!
I have been enchanted by Rowlgs wk on the past Harry Potter books but none have come close to the tensy of this novel Rowlgs use of wds captured me wh the first chapter  I was not able to put  down  This tale of hardships  heartaches gripped me by the collar of my shirt   wouldn't let me go until the end  If you haven't read this  any  other of the Harry Potter series I highly recommend them to all ages I  don't want to give away of the sty so I'm gog to leave  to you to  read  Just remember that  never hurt anyone young  old to let  their imagations carry them away!
Oh my God!  Aga JK puts her readers under a spell  Why?Must these books be wrten sooooo far apart  I read this  2 days stopped f nothg  My mom was gettg mad at me sce I read right through dner  If you've read the book already you know why This is probably the best book yet  FFilled wh suspense mystery  sometimes tradegy this book cast a spell over me not allowg me yo put  down  I will adm even I was scared  The endg is deffatlly left open f another suspensful book I've heard comg oyut July 20001  Why?  Why did I read  soooo fast It's tooo goood to put down  I nned me Harry Potter!
When I dered Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone I did not realize  was supposed to be a children's book  After readg  I still did not realize   I dered the next 2 books  to my delight each one was  better than the one befe   In the year that followed I read them each  aga at least 3 times  Fally I got my copy of Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire  Although I had hoped  would be at least as good as  Prisoner of Azkaban I had no idea that Rowlgs could so far surpass the  previous 3 books  Goblet of Fire is suspenseful engrossg endearg  entertag  I could not put  down  I am 44 years old but I will  be stg  le wh all the kids to get the next Harry Potter book
Here are my ratgs f the other books  the series: #1: 2 stars #2: 3 stars #3: 4 starsI expected an improvement but none came It is a disgrace to all fantasy books It was bg  not even dark like they  said In fact the only thg that was amazg about  was that she  somehow managed to stretch  over 700+ pagesIf you want to read a GOOD  book red Terry Brooks
Wow This book left me stg  awe I'll adm when I started readg I was nearly posive that  would eher be Cho Chang  Hagrid that died but I was wrong Rowlg has never failed to surprise me  these books  when I thk I have everythg figured out I'm now gog to tackle some  issues that came up wh the book so hang tight I did not thk that  Voldemt could get any me evil but I was wrong He has risen aga   he is me deadly than ever I thk that  I saw Wmtail (AKA Peter  Pettigrew) I would attempt to take him down  make a Dement kiss him I  mean come On the guy killed Cedric Diggy  cold blood he betrayed  Harry's parents  got them killed He just makes me angry I am glad to  see the darker me hric turn the series has taken  this book I was  afraid that  would become fun  fancy free  lose s edge but wh  the way this awesome piece of lerature ends I say  is only gog to  get darker The endg leaves me wantg me Has Dumblede severed all  ties to the mistry? Is Sirius (my fave character by the way) cleared?  Is the great Remus Lup to return to fight wh them agast Voldemt?  Will the Malfoys get beaten by an angry mob? Am I losg my md over this?  Well the only thg to do is read this f yourself  decide Until  next time when the Shadow of the Dark looms over us Muggles I bid you  adieu                          - Tom McCd
JK Rowlg's 4th book  the Harry Potter series outdoes all the other three! A 734 page book ( the US) jam-packed wh fun suspense laughs  thrills on every page (My mom  I fought over whose turn  was to  read next!)  Can't wa f #5!
I loved JK Rowlg's newest Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire but I have some thgs to say The book grabs you right from the start Rowlg doesn't bother wh as much briefg of previous books as she did wh the  first three  I read all 734 pages  9 1/2 hours  stayed up til 4   the mng However after readg  I have to say even though this is  a great book  wasn't my fave of the series Book Three  my  opion was a better book First off Hogwarts still had Quiddch   even though Goblet of Fire had the Quiddch Wld Cup I thk Hogwarts  Quiddch is me terestg Also Goblet of Fire's climax is a duel  between Harry  Voldemt (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named etc) Book Three was  slightly me satisfyg at the end  didn't l Harry  the hospal  wg Goblet of Fire was a great book  you should buy   you'd don't  have   doesn't get bg  the middle like some long books do It  was fabulous whout a doubt What I am potg out is despe rave  reviews this isn't the best book of the series
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by FAR the best book  the Harry series Yes I'm sure you know 's 734 pages long but  is wth every wd Rowlg is gettg comftable wh the characters of Harry Ron   Hermione  the sty seemed to tell what they were really like The book  had so many details that enhanced  so much but I odn't want to spoil the  book f anyone so do yourself a fav- get a copy today  READ IT!
JK Rowlg has done  once me! In this book Harry is 14  back at Hogwarts once me I don't want to give away too much but I will say that you get to see The Quiddch Wld Cup see a comeback of characters from previous books  be spellbound by the contuation of this wonderful  series! Rowlg also adds  a dash of possible romance f some of our  fave characters! If you loved the first three novels you'll love this  own just as much  not me! Rowlg sprkles  a few swear wds but  nothg too bad Anyone who loves a fantastic  magical tale will love  this book Give  a try  I promise you will never regret PS: My  parents loved  too!
Wow!

If one ever ss  wonders just what  is that makes a great film st out from other movies what makes games remembered where others are fgotten  what distguishes superb sties from the rest of the books  on the shelf they will hear many dferent reasons  concoct their own  Some will suggest that the key gredients are thgs like havg a certa  amount of plot an terestg gameplay believable characters wrg  that is easy to comprehend an unpredictable roller coaster of mystery   an entertag wty humYet while great movies/games/books ( any  other fms of such media) will tend to have as many of these key  gredients as possible  isn't *any* of these that make them st above  the rest  And while a combation of many of these facts marks to rare   uncommon talent great wk is defely me than the sum of the  partsThe Harry Potter series is somethg que special  When you read   you know  isn't just the characters settg  atmosphere that are  magical  It is the *sty* that takes all of those key characteristics  (characters wh frightengly realistic depth of personaly   believable motivations a sophisticated yet followable plotle a settg  so picturesque  could have been pated on a canvas delightful hum)   crafts them to a very deliberately designed experience  Throughout  the series  is very clear to the reader that Rowlg knew exactly what  she was dog  exactly how she wanted them to feelWhile the first  three books tended to beckon the reader's feelgs to the desired effect  The Goblet of Fire thrusts the reader through subtle combations of  stronger  me mature emotions that Rowlg describes  bright hues of  vivid detail  You open this book almost twice the size of the others  expectg a heavier read  You come away  the end almost feelg a  heavier burden on your soul  Whether you are currently around Harry's age   remiscg about when you were you know how he feels throughout even  the thickest of his dealsAnd f those who ever wonder just what the  big fuss is about this is one of the better series where  is &quotwth  the time to fd out&quotPS Also rather cute is how Rowlg dispels  some of the common misconceptions about the sty ( mispronunciation of  some names)e   remiscg about when you were you know how he feels throughout even  the thickest of his dealsAnd f those who ever wonder just what the  big fuss is about this is one of the better series where  is &quotwth  the time to fd out&quotPS Also rather cute is how Rowlg dispels  some of the common misconceptions about the sty ( mispronunciation of  some names)
This book really surprised me  I loved the first 3 books but there wasn't this sane urge to rush out  buy the next one when  came out  Book 4 however fixed that  When I fished  late last night I  immediately wanted to pick up the next one  This book is a departure from  the other 3  The series has been gettg slightly darker sce book 1 but   this book the darkness that is You-Know-Who really comes to play   of course Harry is left to deal wh the ramicationsThis book had  so many twists  turns that just drew me along wh them  I didn't know  who I was supposed to like  who I wasn't  And not all the webs have  come unraveled  Now we have 2 me schools that will have to be reckoned  wh  the next 3 books  Also there are secrets revealed whose effects  will be felt  all the followg books  However Harry wh the help of  Ron  Hermoe Dumbledf Sirius  Hagrid will be able to overcome  them all
This is by far the best book I have read that has been wrten  the past 100 years I feel that the the Harry Potter series will st the test of time along other classics such as &quotDavid Copperfield&quot   &quotAlice  Wonderl&quot  I feel that Rowlg adjusts her style of  wrg to the creasg matury of her characters thus brgg a  demensionalism to them that makes me feel as  I knew them personally I  would recommend this book to a child  my 86 year old grfather because   is a treat f the md  the heart
I have all 4 books I am 36 years old  let me tell you the latest stallment just contues wh the best readg qualy f childrenWh wonderful stytellg  imagation JK Rowlg just  keeps toppg herself wh each stallment although I am partial to the  first book this is just as goodI won't give anythg away here but  just to buy Its a long one about 734 pages but absolutely wonderfulI  was wried that JK Rowlg would end up like Anne Rice just crankg out  her novels so fast that they would lose there styleBut not hereI  really don't want them to release a movie about Harry Potter I am afraid   would ru my own imagative wld that I have created  these  booksBuy  you won't be disappoted
I thought this book was very dferent from the other Harry Potter BooksIt had a whole new arrangement to   Although  is much me readg I found I couldn't put  down I had to fd out  Harry would  ever w the tiwizard turnament   he would ever fally beat Ld  Voldermont  I found this book quiet terrestg  I thk any reader of  any age would to
I am 27 years old  I am just wild about Harry Potter  This is not an attempt to capture my lost youth  is my unflaggg love f a great sty  Harry is all of the thgs that has been wrten about him:  he is  fun whimsical  all-around great but there is me here than meets the  adult eye  He is also complex compellg  thought-provokg  This is  proven most effectively  this fourth novel  This novel is denser  plot  than most of the so-called &quotadult novels&quot I have read lately   richer  character than most of the weepies that Oprah has recommended   the last few months  We were all kids once  we can all identy wh  Harry's  early passage to puberty  Throw  a great mystery the rich  development of old friends (Harry  his friends are NOT static characters  like most series I have read they change  mature wh each book)   you have a greatjuicy read  Bottom le folks kids own Harry but we  can hop on  enjoy the ride
I LOVED this new Harry Potter adventure! It is so good! I can't keep my nose out of   I can't wa to see the movies!
Harry Potter books just get better! I read this book  one day i couldn't put  down! harry potter's adventures don't just appeal to children as i enjoy readg Potter's adventures as much as anyone else  buy   read over the summer  )
This book is one of the best of the best books this millenium!  The plot was so clever!  Believe me your guess would never f the answer unless you read the book!  I tell you J K Rowlgs has h the jack  pot!  You need to purchase this book because there'll nothg like   f millenuims!  Now here's your chance
This was simply the best Harry Potter book yetNot really awhole lot me to say  I'm lookg fward to book 5
This fourth stallment  the bewchg Harry Potter series has s readers held tight The 734 page book is the best  the series about a wizard boy who attends Hogwarts Shcool of Wchcraft  Wizardry The book  can be a ltle confusg at first but  you read the hard parts over  aga  may be the best out of all
(WARNING: The followg THOUGHTS are rambly  somewhat disconnected but I just thought I'd be a good cizen  pot out some maj flaws  this era of Harry Potter hype)---In terms of adventure  general style  all four books are wonderful JK Rowlg certaly has a good avid  imagation f a mother These are defely the books to get your kids  terested  readg b/c  lets them see how enjoyable a readg  experience will be HOWEVER beg a bookwm all my le (all 23 years) I  can only compare JK ROWLING sty imagation rather than her WRITING STYLE  to that of Jane Yolen  Madele Engle Her wrg is very mediocre   reads like a Stephen Kg novel --- simple  screenwrer-ish Whereas  Yolen's  Engle's novel are much me graceful wh excellent diction   wd use makg a stronger readg It would do no justice f some  hollywood producers like Warner Brothers to make a 'good' Yolen Book Movie  Tradional readers who have loved Yolen Engle  Lloyd Alexer (The  Black Cauldron series) would certaly be disappoted  the Hollywood  version of their books I mean look what happened to THE BLACK CAULDRON It  was the most hrible science fantasy book turned movie I had ever seen!  They dropped out imptant scenes from the igal Alexer book And  that's not even talkg about how terrible the animation was It's no  wonder  did so bad at the box officebut I digress  I predict that  these upcomg Harry Potter movies will not have that same effect on me b/c  these books were WRITTEN f the big screen Potter book plot les are  predictable  sweet  made f TV The only way Warner Brothers would  butcher the movie is  they had harry potter wh an American accent In  this case the harry potter books would be another case of hollywood  killg good lurature (any books that spire you to read) b/c I ALREADY  have  graed  my md that the HARRY POTTER BOY IS BRITISH not  American So get  RIGHT this time WB WHATS MY POINT? I personally thk  there is a lot of hype over all four books I read the fourth HP book   just two days And I just cant get over feelg how could someone who's  wrg style is so mediocre could make millions of american dollars? I  guess  goes to show what sensationalism  a person wh a somewhat OK  imagation can do So parents  you're lookg f books that spire  them (your kids) to become wrers  heck JUST READERS of the tradional  st that wre 'good' fiction these would not be the books I would  recommend I give  a 3 b/c I believe wrg style is just as imptant  as wrg a good adventure  JK ROWLING only got a 3 b/c of the good  stytellg part PS F a dose of REALLY good science fantasy 5 stars  you should read: 1) all of Mollie Hunter books (A Stranger Came Ashe The  Kelpie's Pearl etc) Sce these books were published some 30 odd years ago   the last time I read them was 12 years ago they are no longer  prt  but your local library should have them I also recommend all the Patricia  C Wrede books  her unicn/prcess books I would also list all of  Lloyd Alexer  books--all the Pryda novels as well as his other  children series If you want a quick synopsis go see the edial reviews  on these books via amazoncom  These books I listed I believe are much  better  helpg your children who might be strugglg wrers wre  betterAmerican So get  RIGHT this time WB WHATS MY POINT?

Anyone who was lucky enough to get their hs on a copy of this book befe  sold out was lucky!   is the best harry potter book yet    we see harry growg up as well as a huge amount of excment  had  darg plots   is so teresntg you wont put  down i read the  entire thg  one night as i found that when i went to leave the book  the plot was to excg to leave  i had to contue readg   is  terribly sad  some parts   others funny al i can say is that any  fiction reader young  old has to read this as otherwise they really are  missg somethg special
This book has so many unexpected twists  turns After fishg the book I realized how wrapped up I had been    I even ate my meals while readg!  I am anxiously awag the next book  will probably get   the second  comes out  Keep up the good wk Mrs Rowlg!
Hard to see why people are wastg their money on this secondrate wk  This has to be the most poly wrten  conceived plot a long time  The characters are shallow  bg  the plot is easy to guess  I suppose that people like this series because  isn't about anythg realistic  If you want to read this kd of fantasy pick up somethg by Raymond Feist who is much me entertag  not so childish
THE NEW BOOK IS A PAGE TURNING THRILLER BETTER THAN ALL OF THEFIRST THREE TOGETHER THE BEST J K ROWLING BOOK YETIT IS FILLEDWITH ADVENTURE ON EVERY PAGE
The 4th Harry Potter is the best so far f the older kids but there are a few sparse cuss wds The 734-page-book may also be better to read aloud  to kids under 4th  5th grade sce the readg is kd of heavy  Anyways I loved   I thk most other young teens will too
This was possibly the most anticipated of any summer on recdbut did  meet expectations?  F sheer volume (pardon the pun)  number of pages  almost doubled the size of The Prisoner of Azkaban  Yes JK Rowlgs still has the pen wh the golden k that can dazzle children   adults alike by drawg them ever deeper to her tail of the  beleagured wizard--trag  However there are a few scenes early   the novel that may give slight pause to the parents of the earliest  readers I would highly recommend this book  am currently considerg  as a read  aloud f my fth grades this year dependg on how many have aleady read  the sty this summer
I can't wa f Harry Potter 5! In the midst of studyg cases  laws school i squeezed  just enough time to fish goblet of fire  i'm so glad that the philippe release was also july 8!  jk rowlg is a  wonderful styteller  at first i thought that the plot was que  complicated  i also though she serted too many characters  but she was  able to tie everythg together  the endg is somethg i thk nobody  would've ever expected  harry potter  the goblet of fire was wth the  long wa!
Great book!  I would give  six stars Long but wth  Miss Rowlg rights wonderfully  keeps your attention the entire time! I recommend anyone to read ! Even adults I can't wa untill the next ones come out!
I bought all of the harry potter books out yet from amazon  i loved them all but this is by far the best one  I read the book  3 days   is mystyg  suspenseful  The Harry Potter books are my all time  fave books  this one is the best one by far  It is defly wth  the 15 some bucks  i would have spent 30 on   If you are new to the  seires by them all   you read the previous 3 you should get this  one
Goblet of Fire was engrossg from cover to cover  While many national reviews found  too adult-like f children I thk a maj pot is beg missed  Harry is growg up just as our children are growg up   Ltle by ltle these books are gag a  broader perspective  How  bg would this book be  every conflict was wraped  a neat ltle  bow?  Bravo JK f contug to give us somethg dferent   challengg Many Star Wars fans feel that The Empire Strikes Back is the  best episode  many Harry Potter fans will thk Goblet of Fire is the  best book f some of the same reasons
 is such a good book I couldn't put  down read   four days I thk JK Rowlg is a very creative wrer can't wa f the fth book  would like to say the fourth one was very movgI cried alot   laughed alot  have started to reread the book already would like to  clear one thg up you pronounce Hermiones' name her-my-on-knee
THIS BOOK IS GREAT  I LOVE THIS BOOK  IT'S THE GREATEST BECAUSE I LOVE THIS BOOK  I WOULD MARRY IT IF I COULD! IT'S GREAT! I LOVE THIS BOOK! IT'S GREAT AND I LOVE IT! IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK BECAUSE I LOVE  IT AND IT'S THE GREATEST!
Rowlg lives up to her tradion of makg her books me excg(not to mention longer) as the series goes along Potter does not manage to defeat Voldemt quickly  easily as  the first  second books but rather barely makes  away wh his own le The endg makes you want to start  savg up f the fth one leavg off at a perfect place f a new  adventure This is the most desired boook among children sce well  sce the third Harry Potter book! Rowlg makes the magic wld realistic  wh a blunderg Mistry a nasty press repter owl post   &quotmagic  everythg from classes to meals&quot The plots can take  unexpected turns wh potions to transfm to other people Invisibily  Cloaks  lie-detectg Sneakoscopes The tone of the book can vary from  hrygly grim  he early part of the endg to light-heartedly funny  durg weekends (especially when the Weasly tws are around) Althoughy a  tad slower than the others the 734-page wa simply adds to the suspense   excement of readg a book you've been wag f all year I  fished whh ten hours  wished  was 7000 pages stead An  excellent wk of lerature  well wth the wa
Anyone wil like this new addion to the Harry P collection  No matter  you are five fty  one hundred!  I like  beause  is magical yet so believable!  Harry is facg all of the problems  effects of beg an adolescent  I can relate to some of them He is also facg  the problems  effects of beg a teen wizard at Hogwarts School of  Wchcraft  Wizardry such as helpg his giant friend raise a dragon  It is a thrillg adventure but don't feel apprehensive to read  to a  five  four year old  Sry I am runng sht on wds  time adios  (goodbye  Spanish)!
Harry Potter IV lives up to the hype  expectations  We picked up the book first thg  the mng  my daughter (age 9) fished befe she feel asleep  Her review is &quotwow!&quot  I (age 43) took a b longer  (4 days) but had the same reactionI've seen many comments on the length  of the book  I agree  feels like  could be 100 pages tighter  If  you're a Harry Potter fan I thk the first 150 pages are a b slow as  much of the sty from the first three books is repeated but once the new  school year starts the book takes off  I'm also tempted to say that there  are too many extraneous details but wh Potter 's hard to know which  details are unimptant now but central later on  (Remember Scabbers?)  So while Ra Skeeter seems st of a distractg subplot who knows?
JK Rowlg's fourth Harry Potter novel is a pleasant  darg surprise  It is one of the few sequels to not only meet but also surpass every hope I could have had f   She contues to build from the  previous three novels  a way that wonderful as they are they now seem  like background fodder by comparison to the richness of the fourth novelHowever I would like to extend a strong wd of caution to all parents  Harry is now 14 years old  Rowlg is wrg very much towards a me  mature audience  Her wld now has me complex issues such as racism   murder (all of which are hled wh a depth which shows why Rowlg  should never be listed as just &quota children's wrer&quot)  A few  deaths occur  the book  I strongly recommend that parents read the book  befe their children so that they can be prepared to help their children  deal wh the book's fal _very tense_ chapters
My ne year old son  I have read every Harry Potter book  (Thank you f sendg this on the very day  came out)  We believe each one is better than the last  the same is true f The Goblet of Fire  An  excg adventure
JK Rowlg succeeds aga  this fourth novel of the Harry Potter series She gas the attention of readers because of her imagative  always terestg wizardg wld F example: Quiddch the highly  excg spt has awed readers at 's own igaly Some low spots are  when characters are deep to some tense dialogue but that doesn't  really spoil the book I must say that the book is a b me dark   violent Surprises are around every page though I would recommend this  book f a present to a friend wh a huge imagation
At the begng  started off kd of slow but at the very end (about the last 50 pages) everythg Harry went through  Dumblede's speech at the end were really movg But overall this book doesn't have somethg that the previous books had  There was somethg fced about  this book  didn't flow as smoothly as the others did  Maybe JK  Rowlg was  a hurry to wre   But I thk she could have made the  book flow me smoothly  the number of pages less  she had maybe spent  me time polishg  up I loved book 3  is by far my fave  I  was a ltle disappoted wh the fourth one but once aga I'll say  that the action  speech at the end were promisg  I can't wa to  get the 5th one  Oh yeah I'm 17  I have to say that these books are  undeniably better than a lot of the books wrten f teenagers  adults
Or at least that's how I spent my weekend I read   read   didn't put  down until I had gotten all the way to the back cover Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire had me entranced Harry Hermione (whose name I fally know how to pronounce) Ron- they'd all grown  there was  further growg  ste f them This 4th book answered many many  questions yet left me wh many me There is an immense change  this  book no longer is everythg happy  tied up nicely everythg is  changg there IS defately a dark side to Rowlg's wrg now She  takes us from the Quiddch Wld Cup back to Hogwarts  at Hogwarts  thgs are dferent too certa events have changed  there is  soemthg BIG wag not just f Harry but f all students of Hogwarts  One thg though- f all those who hate Draco Malfoy ( who doesn't)  you have a wonderful treat  ste! If you loved all the other Harry  Potter books you'll love this one dferent as  is  like me you'll  be hangg out f number Five
Read this book f yourself! Don't let anyone give away the surprises It is SO MUCH FUN! This book has everythg! It is at the same time laugh-out-loud funny (the characters the spells the names!)   nail-bgly thrillg People you learn to love  some you love to  hate Is the book too long? Hardly! The last 100 pages  so I couldn't  put  down -- the action was too quick to let go f even a mute But  try not to speed through  -- sav every sentenceChapter 1 will knock  your socks off! Jo Rowlg is an disputable genius  her wrg just  gets better  better Not only has she created an entire complex wld  filled wh believable characters but those characters all have rules they  have to live by  the wld self has physical laws  lims She  matas consistency  book four so that the wld remas very very  real to us as we read  And the imagery! It's like we're  &quotwatchg&quot the book! We can &quotsee&quot  all happeng as  we read The book just opens up the whole realm of the imagationHarry  Potter is such a joy No wonder kids of all ages (I'm a baby-boomer!) have  become fans And f goodness' sake start wh book one! You'll underst  so much me  enjoy  so much me  you start at the begng  (&quotHP &amp the Scerer's Stone&quot) As  that were a dficult  assignment -- that's like sayg &quotOh no you shouldn't eat your  fourth piece of this delicious chocolate cy until you've had your  first&quotAnd the sty -- well so many adventures so many plot  twists! Who will be hurt? Whom can you trust? When can you start readg!
I honestly believe that this is JK Rowlg's best book so far  I got  the day  came out  fished  that eveng!  I was especially pleased that Sirius Black had a fairly large role  He has been  my fave character sce the third book  I would highly  recommend this book f anyone above the age of ne who does not want to  be considered a muggle!
JK Rowlg must know an awful lot about kids while readg this book  the parts about the Yule Ball (&quotWho are you gog wh?&quot)  all the social stms that pop up frequently (&quotWhy won't you talk to Ron Harry?&quot) I felt like I was takg a trip back to the halls of my  school where the same st of gossip  arguments eruptedThe  characters are better than ever  the fourth book- their arguments   feelgs have turned me complex an obvious sign that they are gettg  older-  they are much me entertag (especially Ron who rocks!)  They're me mature wh their language (mostly Ron who still rocks)    any of you parents out there thk your kids will turn to delquents   they see that dreaded four-letter &quotD&quot wd four times  700  pages then you might want to steer clear of Harry Potter 4 ( about  every other book out there wh a readg level above 3) There is talk of  people flickg each other off  swearg  a few rude but perfectly  juvenile comments (y'know a joke about &quotseeg Uranus&quot   Divation that stuff) Many characters from previous books return  even  only f a page  two (Sirius Dobby Wmtail Moang Myrtle  even Stan Shunpike the pimply teen on the Knight Bus)  We learn the  sties behd the characters like why Neville lives wh his grmother   why Hagrid is so big  Loads of new tricate characters are  troduced cludg the challengers from the other two wizardg schools  (who speak wh accents that were cool to read aloud)Everyone seems to  be awed by the length of HP4 I say &quotYeah well couldn't  have  been longer! &quot The longer the better  Harry's case!  I couldn't  take my eyes off the pages  not once did I get bed The mystery is  me complex  ever  the climax was absolutely stunng  The 5th  book is gog to be awesome mark my wds  The endg of HP4 has set   up to be excg!You defely have to READ THE OTHER 3 BOOKS OR  YOU WILL NOT GET IT!o be excg!You defely have to READ THE OTHER 3 BOOKS OR  YOU WILL NOT GET IT!
She's done  aga! JK Rowlg has wrten another exceptional book Harry Pottter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book yet The thrill of the book will keep you readg I spent several nights on my bed readg  until 1-2  the mngIn her new book JK Rowlg takes a slightly  dferent approach to the way she wres the events at Hogwarts Instead of  wrg about Harrys' problems that he ran to  classes f the first  half of the first three books she moves her focus to the  &quotextra-curricular&quot wizzard leFrom the start of the  Triwizzard Tournament Harry was  grave danger When he reaches the end   discovers that Ld Voldernt has risen aga the book takes a sharp  turn Fgettg about evderyday le  the castle Rowlg troduces the  problems that befe had only appeared to Harry  his dreams  Unftunately f the Wizzardg Wld these dreams become a realyI  highly reccomend tis book to anyone who has read the first three  der  Do not read this book befe any others The series Rowlg has created was  meant to be read from book one to book 7Now we hope that Book 5 can be  as wonderful as the past four We're wag Harry!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was deed a masterpiece Good hum mixed  wh srow  excement makes this book one of the best ever wrten Of course that's not the only reason It provides so much detail  that you can feel like you're really there JK Rowlg has the unique  capabily of makg the wds pierce like a swd  make you feel f  the character Children can relate to Harry Potter Adults can underst  the mals This book is a masterpiece
Wh 734 pages you can't go wrong  this book was not longer than  had to beIn this book Harry is headed to the Quiddch Wld Cup The Weasleys have managed to get prime seats f this excellent game At the  Wld Cup though Harry Sees the Dark Mark (The Sign Of Ld Voledemt) He  also sees Bad Death Eaters After that someone puts his name to the  Goblet Of FireWhy do these mysterious thgs happen to harry? read to  fd out
This was a great book It reveals many secrets about characters  shows a lot of emotion I really liked this book me than the others because of a few reasons 1: was much longer  i didnt fish  as fast as the  other ones2:It was me detailed about people3:It gave a good endg  while like all the other books explaed everythg  the end I really  thk this was a great book  reccomend  to anyone who will read   although this one was a ltle darker than the others
On the posive side I read this book  12 hours (yes non-stop!) so obviously I did enjoy  enough to keep at  I  thk Rowlg conjures up a charmg wld populated by wild thgs  people Her imagation  parallels that of another (older) Brish wrer of children's books Enid  Blyton who is unftunately not well known  the USThe weaknesses  to the new book are the same as f the other books  the series:  the  plot les are rather weak the villas bg  unidimensional rather  than really scary (does Voldermt keep you up at night? Thought not) the  confrontations between Harry  the villas rather anti-climactic after  the big build-up (the REALLY big build-up  the case of this latest  tome)I thk  she is a fun enjoyable styteller but I don't thk she  is  que the same league as Tolkien  even CS Lewis This Harry Mania  that is sweepg the wld is part-publicy stunt part Harry just havg  IT appeal right now These are light charmg books but those who thk  they're lerature don't read very much!
The book is very clever  entertag But as  is apparently targeted to kids aged 9 to 11 I wonder why JK Rowlg opted to make  734 pages long I've never met a kid that age who had ever  would ever tackle a  novel of that timidatg length I'd love to do a poll 6 months from now   fd out how many kids actually managed to fish &quotGoblet of  Fire&quot My prediction is that  would be less than 5%-- that Sry  to toss cold water on everyone's blockbuster publishg event of the  moment It just strikes me as a ltle b weird
The book was on my dostep when I woke up on July 8 I fished by dner July 9 I kept puttg  down I wanted to sav  Who knows how long  will be until book five is published But I could not stop I had to know  the outcome of the Triwizard competionThis book is darker than the  first three There is death not just  the distant past but wh  Hogwarts There are the premonions of wide spread evil to come But there  is still the underlyg foundation that most people (wizards  muggles  alike) are good That light will prevail over the darknessA friend  wh a six-year-old has decided to wa a while befe contug the  series wh her child Each parent should judge f themselves whether  their child is ready to hle the darknessI am now wag impatiently  f the Harry's Fth year at Hogwarts to start I thk  will be the  darkest yet And I hope  is just as long  full of details as the  Goblet of Fire
Very good book but you'll read enough complements from other people I will pot out the only two real problems stead One when the ghosts came out of the w Harry's parents came out  the wrong der This  seems an obvious mistake  I dont know why the ed didnt catch   The other problem is wh the whole w combat scene which seemed rushed   not well thought out But these were the exceptions to a very good  book
This was by far the best of all of JK Rowlg's book's on Harry's adventures  Befe readg I had tried to predict the sty le usg previous fmation from the other books  But after fishg the book  less than a day JK Rowlg proves that tryg to predict the sty le  is as accurate as Profess Trelawney's predicons (wh one known  exception) Whether you are startg pre-school  graduatg from college  this book is wth readg  Discover new characters ga se to  existg ones Some maj/m plot twists to keep you  the sty until  the end What are those strange noises from Fred  Gege's room?  Is  love  the future f Harry?  Read this wonderful book  fd out the  answers to these  many me questions!
The fourth book  the Harry Potter contues  the same ve as s predecesss:  excg colful suspenseful  satisfyg  What a wonderful gt the auth has  what satisfyg lerature this is  Even at over 700 pages  is still too sht
JK Rowlg aga has amazed me All her books have captivated me wh the suspense of the dferent scenarios each character's dividual personalies  powers  wh the amazg imagation behd  all  The &quotGoblet of Fire&quot captures your attention  doesn't let go  It feels as though your part of the sty  your their to wness  all  It also pulls at every human emotion: Joy laughter fear sadness  triumph etc  And of course  leaves many open possibilies f Harry's  future adventures This book as well as the previous 3 are a great read  f any age Enjoy!
Well At first when i saw the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot on the shelf i thought  was a bad book cause s cover was dumb but  started readg  i luved  way better than the first 3  fished   one night s  awesome there is the Quiddch Cup  the Triwizard Tourney  plenty of  saspence
Out of all the books I've read the Harry Potter series  especially this book brought me to new heights of delight fear happess danger  excement  Amazgly J K Rowlg is able to put together such books of great excement that make me fall out of my seat  I was able to fish this book  5 days  I am only 9 years old  I defately would  reccommend this book f anyone who loves adventures  They will be  f  the time of their lives!
Harry Potter is the best books I have ever read!  I hate to read but when I had friends tellg me Harry Potter is the best books I bought them!  All four!  I can't put  down!  I can't read  the car because than I get  car sick but I tried  wh Harry Potter  I guess I was so hooked on   I read eight chapters  the car!  I just want to say to JK Rowlg  that &quotDon't stop wrg!  Harry Potter is the all time book!  I hope  f me  me of Harry Potter's adventures!
Gozamos de ler esta obra recente p JK Rowlg una obra magnica en la histia de letras para la juventud!Anticipamos el proximo! !Ya estamos listos!
Those who have waed f the release of this fourth stallment will not be disappoted  In fact despe the fact that the book is over 700  pages the sty grips the reader  In a time when imagation has been  dulled by images from movies video games  television JK Rowlg  retroduces the concept masterfully  The style f Book 4 is  carefully constructed  the details are very well managed  It will be a  long wa f the next book!
You would expect that after three books that do bear some similary  the basic plot one should be able to see  comg But far from  I never would have suspected the peron who turned out to be a traIt's  also nice to know that pigs can fly after all Well some of em
I thk that the book is wonderful I could not take my eyesoff the book f 4 hours(till i fished ) which i totally regretI thg that  is the best book JK has wrote out of all the Harry Potter booksMy mother did not want to buy the book f me because she said  is bad cas' wches wizards(she iz a christian) But when i bought  she started readg  I thg  a way JK knows how to wre a book so good that young  old all can enjoy  Trust mei read the first book 5 times secound book 7 times third book 7 times  the fourth book 4 times My mother thks  is stupid to read a book so many times but i love the book so much that i cant seem to get enought of 
Not only is this by far the best book of the Harry Potter series I believe  is the best book I've ever read!  J K Rowlg's tale of a now  14 year old famous wizard's journey through his fourth year at Hogwart's  School of Wchcraft  Wizardry keeps you on the edge of your seat  Every page is filled wh an adventure  there are que a few  tear-jerkers toward the end of the book  I would most defely recommend  this book to me mature audiences  is rather dark  even a b scary  at parts but I do feel that most people will greatly enjoy this wonderful  sty
There are 800 some odd reviews here about Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire lettg everyone know that yes  is as great as the other booksI just want to take this small amount of space to thank Amazoncom  f dog such an amazg job durg the sane rush that occurred durg  this books release Wh what was rapidly approachg half-a-MILLION ders  placed to Amazoncom f this book I expected to wa a long time to get   (the price made  wth  though!) To my credible surprise my  der was shipped the very next day  the shippg was upgraded to 2nd  day at no extra charge I have never received better service from an onle  ste  I only wish that I had used Amazoncom f my Xmas shoppg last  year (stead of another se that didn't sent my ems out f a month  &ltahem there UGO&gt)I didn't see anywhere else to praise  Amazoncom so what better place than to do  here This is truly my  unbiased opion as a regular shopper  reviewer I hope stayg  anonymous emphasizes thatThanks f the great service Amazoncom! Now  back to my book
This great book didn't drag like I thought  might because  was so long  But all 734 pages were great  It took me two days to readMy  only drawback is there was an awful lot of appropriate language  Not  terrible wds but still bad
JK Rowlg did  aga!  The sty has lots of twists  turns  the plot is so tight  can hold water  I am amazed by Ms Rowlg! I do thk that a slightly older audience is appropriate here because Book 4 is  scarier  darker than the first three The first 3  4 chapters might be  a ltle tedious f true Potter fans because the reader is &quotcaught  up&quot on the first three books  Otherwise  is fabulous  I can't  wa f Book 5!
this book was the best Harry Potter yet  Once I started readg  I couldn't put  down As always the creatures  new characters  the book are very detailed so  is almost like you are right there wh them!  This book is much me scarier than the other three books  the series  even I read some of the chapters wh the lights on at night! END
JK Rowlg has outdone herself this time!  The Gobet of Fire has just become my fave  the series  Wh page turng action  suspense at every cner you are bound to be entranced wh this book!  JK Rowlg  cleverly weaves emotion to this book so as to make you cheer characters   this sty other than our beloved Harry  Harry really grows as a young  teenager  as a wizard  One thg I did notice  this book much me so  than the others  the series  must be read  conjuction wh the other  books  It doesn't have enough of the background fmation on Harry's  sty to make  a read alone book  JK really creates another page  turner wh Goblet of Fire!
Well I read the fourth one  's not as good as the other threeFirst of all I thk the characters (especially Hermione!) were very flat  didn't have much &quotle&quot  them  the wrg was  very repetetiveespecially like  every paragraph &quotHarry Ron   Hermione&quot That annoyed me a ltleAlso there was a lot of  action but  wasn't grippg  suspensful  the wrg was a ltle  me adultI didn't fd the book up to her level of wrg abily  It's gettg flat It's gettg old Voldemt is gettg a ltle like   a cartoon f four year olds where he speaks of all these evil plans  a  really cheesy wayI've read better  I've read wse Liked the other  three better
While this book is well wrten  entertag s contentdisturbs me  This series makes wchcraft  wizardry seem fun excg when  realy these subjects are extremely serious  should be treated accdgly  I would defely NOT recommend this book to anyone let alone children who are unable to fully realize the implications associated wh these topics
This is a great book!  I began to read  as soon as the derarrived  can't put  down sce!  The book is undoubtedly thebestso far I wish that Ms Rowlg would wre a longer book so that I wouldn't have to fish  soon  Suspenseful too  The next book better come out soon  I'll die of suspense!
This is the best book of all the Harry Potters  OK  i thought  was gog to be a love sty because thats what the ternet said  But 's me of adventure which is better  It has everythg Action adventure  romance  one sad part when someone dies but wh all that you get the  best book  the wld
This book has so many twists  turns that you are on the edge of your seat the entire time  I love the way JK Rowlg uses bs of her past Harry Potter books to weave to the latest sty le  I can't wa f  the next stallment!
I found after spendg several days to read the book that this is one of the most complex yet excellent Harry Potter books I have read all the Harry Potter books  fd the entire style to be very good My  warng is that this book is somewhat darker  me dire actions happen  I would not go below 10 years  so as a recommendation but suggest  all  the way to age 99 (Read the other books first  helps)
I really enjoyed the previous books  the series I was given the set as a gt  I eagerly awaed the arrival of this one  my mailbox --  was most grateful that Amazon fed-exed  to me on the release date  I was  thrilled wh the size -- 's huge  The sty is wonderful  The  characters grow me  I'm recommendg  to everyone!  Can't wa to read  these books to my kids when they are old enough!
this harry potter book had a much darker mood  tone to than the others  Generally the thought that everythg would be allright made the other books easier to hle because you knew people weren't gog to die  But because of the rums flyg on the ternet befe this book had even been published ( wrten) pretty much everyone knew that someone we cared about would die While i'm glad this book wasn't completely dark the endg still made me cry   was a completely dferent feelg than i'd felt after readg the other three  While i enjoyed this book very much f s hum  s tricate plot i was busy anticipatg the death of someone unknown  But this book did live up to Rowlg's stard of wrg  the way she displayed the emotions  happengs is as usual exceptional  The end of the book left open a whole lot of plot but i guess that's how you have to keep us readg!  This book was great because  lasted longer  i am one who wishes that my fave books will just keep gog  This one did is by far the longest of the series  that was nice  There are of course new creatures  new characters who add to the sty wh Rowlg's obvious touch of hum  amusement  She wres to clude the reader  that is possibly the best move she's made wh this series  She makes  attaable because the whole series starts out wh an average 11-year old one that every reader can remember beg  creates f him a new wld where he isn't looked over  Anyway befe i give away the plot i would just like to say that even though this book is completely dferent from everythg we've seen from Rowlg so far  is still an awesome book  i thk that everyone will enjoy !
Harry Potter  the Goblets of fire is another wonderful book wrten by Joanne Rowlg It's just as good as the others  once you start readg   you just can't put  down  you liked the other three harry potter  books? I strongly recommend this one to you
This was by far the best  the Harry Potter series so far!  Igot my copy from Amazon at 11 on Saturday  fished  the nextday It was wonderful the plot carried wonderfuly from book to book  there were many suprises along the way!
Ok--I know some of you are sayg that this may be contrived  fmulated but i must say that this is que honestly the best book that I've read all summer ( i've read que a few)  As far as the Harry Potter series goes this book keep me on my toes the entire time  I wasn't  que sure from the first chapter but once i started seriously readg i  was absolutley hooked!  This book had suspense hum  mystery---me  than I could have ever imaged  Yes i've been wag f some time f  this book to come out  I que honestly expected  to be a let down but  I was most defley surprised when i reached the last 200 pages  so   just could not put  down  I stayed up till 4 am to fish   Md you  that i am 29 years old  Sry but Harry is really great readg  I have been  recommendg  to all of my friends  they've been takg my suggestions   have been lovg him!  I can't reveal the real juicy bs of the book  ( there are a million!) but i must tell you that readg this is wth  every mute!  You will so NOT be disappoted!  Sadly you will have to  wa about another year till Harry V  That totally bumms me out--but i  will probably be there wag f 's arrival wh bells on  :)
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an EXCELLENT book verylong  very good I thk that everybody should read the HarryPotter series of novels They are ALL excellent  this one just adds me excellence to the Harry Potter dynasty I give this books 5 stars!
I have just recently become aware of the Harry Potter bookseries through 's constant media stm Out of curiousy my motherpurchased the four Harry Potter books f my younger brother Out of my own curiousy I picked up Harry Potter  the Scers Stone  was hooked stantly  JK Rowlg talent f stytellg is posvely astoundg I became an stant fan In the week  a half that we've had these four books I have managed to read them all I could not put neher of them down It was only until I fell asleep wh my head  the book that I was actually able to put the book(s) down I especially enojyed Rowlg's gradual evolution of her characters Each of them growg up  their own unique ways  noticg thgs because of their growth that otherwise they would not have noticed befe Book four is the most amazg yet It is also very dferent from the other three Unlike 's predecesss this book will leave the reader wantg me than ever I myself cannot wa until Harry's 5th year at Hogwarts the fourth book leaves many danglg plots that will have Harry Potter fans runng to the bookstes once aga If you're a new fan such as myself  an old fan young our old you will simply love this book I myself cannot wa until that day comes  cannot wa until the motion picture release of Harry Potter  the Scerers Stone  November of 2001
I like everyone else has eagerly anticipated the arrival of the fourth Potter book  And I was not disapoted  The book is full of magical vivid imagery parts that make you gasp out loud  puns  jokes that amuse  the many adults who read the booksThe only problem I had wh the book  was the shtg tone  It seemed that the climax of the book came so  rapidly  then boom the reader is left wh 50 pages of decendg action  that leave a person feelg somewhat unsatisfiedRowlgs previous  Potter books seemed to ease their way to the dangerous climax whereas  this one slapped you  the face wh Still the book was a wonder  keepg me enthralled  amused  sometimes really scaredI am not  ashamed to adm that when I fished the book I had to sleep wh the  light on
My we  I have read  loved the Harry Potter books sce they first came out  The tone of Goblet is much darker than the previous books   crosses the le from adventure to hr sty  Parents should read  the book  decide f themselves   is appropriate f their children  I personally feel that some of the scenes are too hric f a pre-teen  Don't be surprised  this book duces nightmares  younger readers
It is so hard to believe that me a 37 year old mother of 3 is so wrapped up  a series of books that is geared f 9-12 year olds  Book 4 is by far the best so far which I can't even believe is even possible!  I love  these books because  has gotten everyone  our home to be terested   the same thg  wh ages from 10 - 44 years - that is not somethg  that happens every day so I'll once aga be one of the first to der book  #5!Book #4 does have a &quotdark&quot side  an endg that makes  you thk  Also I enjoyed seeg how the teenagers are wkg through  their everyday problems of growg up!WAY TO GO JK ROWLING!  KEEP UP  THE WONDERFUL WORK!
To date these sties have been amusg full of clever wdplay  elegantly composed but this long fourth sty unexpectedly breaks to ferocious seriousness It scared the bejeebers out of me After a leisurely  buildup &quotthis isn't Kansas anyme&quot wrapped  stunng  Technicol gly  fear This is far me terryg than old fairy tale  violence f we've come to love these people I suspect  will be  hellishly dficult f readers to fd wonderful humour  the next couple  of books Meanwhile the wa f #5 will be excruciatg
I have loved the entire Harry Potter series I remember when I read number 3 I thought  was absolutely one of the best books I have ever read But this one takes the entire series to a whole new level It had the most  amazg twists  turns It kept me up until 2:30 am then I decided that  I had to go to bed It is a b dark  places but stead of beg just  the middle book  a series  is just the begng If the next three are  anywhere as good as this one we should all pre-der them now This is the  best yet  they will only get better
This book was great a wthy sequel to 12  3 The onlythg bad about  is the fact that I have to wa f 5 6  7!I've looked all over - what is the projected date f Harry Potter number 5?
I read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I thought  was really good I fished the book  5 days because I couldn't let  down Those are the kd of books I likeThis book also takes  alot of young readers  So what I thk I thk this book is really good
Harry Potter  The Goblet of fire is awesome Both my childrean enjoy  JK Rowlg hurry we want your 5th book already!
Harry Potter is back wh a longer darker scarier ride then the one's he has faced  books 1-3 A refreshg sp to keep potter from becomg stale734 pages of straight trigue as you are swept along wh harry from  a burng scar dream that left him reachg f a quill  hedwig to  fm godfather  hidg Sirius Black to the other twists  turns that  jk rowlg has conjured up  her latest stallmentAs usual we open to  po Harry at the tolerable cruel hs of the Dursley's  the scar  burng dream he had has left harry wried as well as nervous wag f  a wd from blackHe however has ltle time cuz Ron  the rest of the  Weasly clan have a surprise ste f him that would take up most of the  summer up until year four at hogwarts where upon arrival they are surprised  wh news of a triwizard tournament wh two other schoolsNew characters   the onslaught of Darkness dealg wh dferent schools startg to  show terest  girls  a tabloid pakg quill  even me bothersome  repter will make s mark on a year harry isn't likely to fgetGood  swt readher wds are very fluid  that they flow very wellReccomended  f maybe the 12  up set may be too long  scary f youngerbut   you like harry potter this long of wa  book is well wth can't  wa f five
When is book # 5 comg out? I found this 4th book  theseries to be the least scary  most character driven of all thebooks Rowlg has brought us some new characters de-emphasized some of the me annoyg characters like Malfoy  Crabbe  aga brought good  evil togther  a fight to the death Like the other books the villians rema secret till the very end which keeps you readg wh rapt attention After readg all the hype I kept wag f the dark dark part of the novel but I didn't thk  was anywhere near as dark as Azkaban I thought Rowlg jected a lot of hum to this book  some of the novel was obviously her own FAQ to the potter series like when Hermione told Vict how to pronounce her name I thought that was a riotExcellent job  now my 7 YO son has the book  is plowg thru  He's havg a blast
I can't believe the endg!  They left Harry  the hs of the Muggles while Voldemt is loose?  AACK!  This book wasn't near as good as the other two  The Quiddch Cup lasted way too long  Several of the chapters  could have been shtened  we would have gotten the same impact  I am a  HUGE Harry Potter fan  I haven't been able to tell folks which of the  first three were my favebut #4 will not be  the runng f the  best  Brg on the next issue!  I can't wa to see what happens next!
I'm 19 years old  Harry Potter is one of the greatest thgs to ever happen to me  This Harry Potter book was every b as good as the last three  When I was fished  didn't even feel like  had been over 700  pages  It was the same type of sty  I loved   Harry  company  have started to notice ltle wizards  wches of the oppose sex   that amused me to no end ( I must say that Ron Weasley never ceases to  amaze me)  I love what Rowlg has done wh these books--she's  challengg young mds  gettg them to read  that's  fantasticThe thg I found most disapotg about this book however  was the tle  In the past Harry Potter books have had tles wh  somethg maj from the sty (what would &quotHarry Potter  the  Prisoner of Azkaban&quot be whout Sirius?)  The goblet of fire didn't  play as large of a role as I was expectg  to  that kda  disappoted me  But--hey--'s a good thg  this is the only bad thg  I can say about somethg right?Keep  up Rowlg!  When's the next  one?
After fishg the third book  the Harry Potter series (which was an improvment from the 2nd one) I was really lookg fward to the Goblet of Fire comg out The book is massive but don't thk of size as a reason to pass on this one But  you believe bigger is better  than you're  f a treat And  this case BIGGER is wonderful! I just fished the book today  must say that the auth did a great job of keepg me captivated by the unfoldg sty Those who say that this book was confusg  empty must need some serious pushg  shovg to make themselves read This book was very entertag  fun Read  yourself  enjoy every last page of The Goblet of Fire!
This fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series is the longest  probably the best among them  I highly recommend  to anyone of any age
Everyone loves Harry  he's back aga! In Harry's newest adventure he is  f a lot of excement! If you're already a fan f these wonderful books #4 won't let you down! In &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire&quot Harry is exposed to new schools new changes  new obstacles  Harry fds out a lot of new fmation  this book  as you read you  won't be able to put  down!
JK Rowlg has outdone herself!  This book is the best yet  I liked this book the best because  has great characters  there is always somethg happeng  After readg the first three books the characters  seem like old friends  Although the book has me violence than the others  none of  is very graffic - very nice f my younger son who does not like  a lot of violence  This is the type of book f both boys  girls to  read who like FANTASY  Hermione is a bookwm but she also knows her own  md  is not afraid of usg her knowledge to accomplish what she feels  is right  I can't wa to read the next book I hope that we don't have to  wa too long
 h the bookshops yesterday here  New Zeal  We had our copy pre-dered  my daughter  I tossed a co to see who would get first  go at   I won-  I couldn't put  down all 700-some pages  I  fished   less than a day  now I'm gog to start over wh HP #1   read 'em all aga just to savour the twists  turns of the plot  while my daughter gets her turn at &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quotThis  series should be on the mastream fantasy lists alongside David Eddgs   Terry Pratchett's Discwld series not tucked away  the childrens'  cnerNow we have to wa f HP#5 to come along  give us the next  thrillg stallment- not too long I hope?
Harry Potter And the Goblet of Fire is the best book  theseries! It was hard to put down once I started readg  I read thewhole thg  less than 5 days I can't wa until they come out wh the next Harry Potter book
I couldn't wa to obta my copy of Harry  the Goblet of Fire Just as many Muggles I had July 8th marked on my calendar Wh each book I am me thrilled as I become part of the sty a wizard seeg the  possibilies ahead Part of the fun of readg about Harry is that I can  pull together some of the pieces of the many puzzles that Rowlg has set  f Harry to unravel This truly helps me become a part of Harry's le I  AM there at Hogwarts!  And  is this magic plus the sense that we can  all be like Harry face danger  fear  pull through wiser wh our  friends alongside that has captivated my entire extended family from 5-80  years old The fact that we all love these books has allowed us all to  share a love of readg across our ages  I can't wa to our family  reunion later this month when we can all share our disucssions of what  hts we've uncovered from the wonderful everyday web that Ropwlg has  woven  all four books I knew there was somethg special about Neville!  Who knew that there was a REASON Harry must stay wh the Dursleys' each  summer!  Have fun readg about Harry
This book is better then the 1st2nd 3rdI like how thereare other wizardg schools mentioned  the bookThe last chapterswere the best partI wish the fth book was available
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an awesome book no matter how old you are I'm 12  my parents  sister all liked  It is an amazg book  once you pick  up you won't be able to put  back down aga! (I would recommend readg the first 3 Harry Potter books befe this one  though so you can fully underst  But don't wry they are all  excellent too) Please give this book a chance You will not be  dissapoted!
Wow!  This book is makg alot of press  I can see why!  This is the best book of the series!  I read this  less than a week!  In this book Harry goes to the Quidch Wld Cup But somethg goes terribly wrong  But Harry has to go back to Hogwarts where they embark on the Triwizard  Tournament  There is only suppose to be 3 champions one from each school  But now theres 2 from Hogwarts  And you guessed who was the 4thHarry!  Now Harry has to go through 3 tasks befe gettg the gly  But who put  his name  there?  I'm really glad Sirus is back  the book!  But while  all this happens Harry fds revealg secerets about Ludo Bagman Crouch  Snape  even Hagridmy fave character!  Hermoe almosts gets a  boyfriend  But hey Ms Rowlg could you have Ron  Hermoe together?  I mean he was jealous that she was gog wh someone  I've known from  the second book that they should get together  I hope they do  the 5th  but the book doesn't turn out to be another soap opera!  I really loved  this book!  Everyone should read   I thk you will love  too!  Go  Harry!
The book is very clever  entertag But as  isapparently targeted to kids aged 9 to 11 I wonder why JK Rowlgopted to make  734 pages long I've never met a kid that age who had ever  would ever tackle a novel of that timidatg length I'd love to do a poll 6 months from now  fd out how many kids actually managed to fish &quotGoblet of Fire&quot My prediction is that  would be less than 5%-- that  Sry to toss water on everyone's blockbuster publishg event It just strikes me as a ltle b weird
The book is good but I just don't thk 's toogreat There's no plot I thk people like  because 's a longfairytale You can buy  I just don't recommend rushg out to get  So I do thk people who like fairy tale  adventure/mystery should get this book Otherwise I don't recommened  at all I've read many many other books  this isn't one of my faves You can get  but good luck wh likg !
Rowlg's best wk yet  was unbelievably good A b long  unsuable f younger kids but still amazg Rowlg goes to thgs seldom touched by other children's auths I got  at 2 yesterday night   fished at 8 the next mng ( yes i did sleep f 9 hours md  you) couldn't put  down I can't wa to hear all about Harry's 5th  year at Hogwarts The only fault was that not enough focused on Hogwarts  but i still love !  Excellent book reccommended to all
All right you want to read Harry Potter 4? Well give yourself 4 days  of sleepless nights  just read Because once you start readg your not gog to put  down The entire book just moves It's almost like watchg a movie except the Harry Potter movies SUCK<BR>One of JK Rowlg's great talents is too grab the reader beat  mercilessly across the head  then leave them hangg (In a good way) I have heard people say "man that books f kids" Then they read   are like me overwhelmed by the book  can't wa f the next ANYONE CAN READ THIS AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT 5 stars is an understatement
I am 28 years old  I enjoyed the first three Harry Potter books immensely this stallment is no exception  Goblet of Fire takes the themes  subplots that have been buildg  brgs them to a head  Previous reviews describg this as the pivotal book  the series are not  exaggerated  While the entire sty is good  the last 200 pages  so  Rowlg ties together all the strgs  effectively sets up what will  surely be a dramatic struggle  the books to follow  The themes  Goblet  of Fire are universal: friendship family trust loyalty betrayal  In  's own way this series is a wthy heir to Tolke's Ld of the Rgs   Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series
This book is fantastic I read a lot of fantasy books but this by far is the best children's fantasy book I have ever read It keeps you anticipatg what awesome thg is gog to happen next  how is Harry  gog to deal wh the suation Some of the characters you love some you  love to hate  some characters have you so confused that you don't know  whose side they are really on And Rowlg's descriptions of people   places are so well done that you can just see the character  the place so  vividly  your md This is a book f adults as well as children  F  all of you parents who get tired of readg the same book over  over to  your child read a chapter  two of this book to him  her F those who  crisize the book because of the wches  wizards remember this is a  wk of fictiondarn good fiction F me  has kept me wantg me  I was so sry when I got to the last page I wanted  to contue I  cannot wa f the next book I hope the movie is gog to be as good as  the books have been My son agrees the Harry Potter books are wonderful  F the first time ever my son enjoys readg
This book this &quotpivotal novel&quot  the famed  very popular harry potter series made me laugh out loud made me cry  actually made me gasp J K Rowlg uses so much feshadowg that i couldn't put the  book downespecially near the end  The amount  rate of suspense  contaed  this novel is credible   has certaly lived up to  EVERYONE'S expectations  Under defe pressure  stra J K Rowlg  has managed to produce yet another thrillg adventure f Harry Ron  Hermione (pronounced HER-MY-O-NEE as we fd out somewhere  the middle  of &quotthe Goblet of Fire) to act out f us while makg us feel like  we're a part of   It's hard to believe that you're not stg at  platfm 9  3/4 leang casually through the wall to catch the Hogwarts  Express wh harry  ron  I as a 17 year-old avid reader of Harry  Potter thought that this book had the most plot to follow  the most  emotion (f the reader) compared to the other books  Rowlg has lived up  to her prevous books  has possibly even surpassed them wh this latest  stallment  She builds up so many sties at once that the reader is  constantly kept busy tryg to remember what happened last  each  successive plot  I loved this book i thk  is the best  the series  so far despe the fact that  was considerably darker than the rest   The mention of various dark arts are probably mentioned me  this book  than all the others combed but wh Rowlg's hum to soften the blow  the sty keeps us not only hooked but entranced  Rowlg's new  characters  creatures (cough HAGRID) made the sty that much  betterDumblede kept me laughg alsoi won't give any of the plot  away but i will leave you wh these last wds:  This book will brg out  your sense of hum along wh your sense of febodg -- basically you  won't be able to put  down until you've read the last wd on the last  page  :)
This book was the best one of the series The best thg about  was that  wasn't as sht as the other books were It takes a ltle me times to  read   take  all of the fmation Luckily JK Rowlg did not  release too much fmation about this book This book was way me  excg than the other books were So many events happened  the 752  pages I thk that both children  adults will like this book At least  we now know why  took her so long to wre  I hope you enjoy !
some people thk that this isn't a very good book   is the best  the series so far!  all of the harry potter books are good  make sure  you want to read this one to read the other three first!  i highly reccomend  this book!
I give this book five stars f the first 600  so pages This section of the book starts off wh mysterious evil  encompasses both great hum  amazg devices like the Weasleys' practical clock  the  thought-retag pensieve It also does a masterful job of settg up the  last hundred  so pages This is where the action takes a frantic pace   even Ms Trelawney couldn't predict (like she could anyway) what will  happen next We also get to a lot of excellent characterization  plot  development  this awesome fourth novel by JK Rowlg One of my fave  elements was gettg to see the contrast between Harry's realization that  Dumblede is gettg old  the power  fluence that the headmaster  still wields when he needs to asset his authyFirst ~600 pages: 5  stars After that: 10 starsThe countdown is on to Book #5 !
This is by far the best book JK Rowlg has wrten so far  Yes s 734 pages but I wish  was longer so I dont have to wa so long f the next Harry It was so good so suprisg so trigg  so page turng I  fished   four days to the 20 ms that i got  I purchased my book  from a local book ste at 12:28 AM on Saturday July 8th  I fished on  Tuesday July 11th at 12:12 AM It is a book that you just have to keep  turng the pages READ IT!
I loved the book  I thought I had  figured out at the end but I was wrong just like the previous books  The plot was great  everythg was explaed she left nothg out  let you out your own pieces  together  I love the way she make these books mysterys  However I thk  she should have left out the 'damn'wds I don't fd  appropriate f  children readers  Also all the 'er's got rather annoyg It was dark  but not too dark  Great book!  I can't wa f the next one!
This book is cool I love the way JK Rowlg wres 's so awesome  The way she pieces everythg together to make  f is amazg!  She has real talent  i could never put the book down i ended up fishg    one night  This book is better than the first three  i guarentee you  you'll fall  love w/  after the first chapter!
Harry Potter  the goblet of Fire is clearly the best book of the series Jo Harry Ron  Hermione  Rowlg's best action packed novel yetF 734 pages 's wth 
I started readg the Harry Potter books  1999 I have now read the first three books at least 5 times each  I have been wag the fourth  book to go on sale sce last sprg If I could I would rate this as a ten  star book rather than a five
I got this book on mondayJuly 10I read this book  about 1 1/4 daysI didn't even read  all the timeBut 's easy to get hooked on Theres alot of actionadventure mysteryThis book is amazgIt brgs a lot  me characters out  really makes you feel as  you were  the  bookThis book is a ltle me complicated then the other three books  which i would strongly suggest  that you read them befe you read this  oneThis is a great book to be read as a family  by yourselfI would  recommend this book f anyone over the age of five
Wow! It's a wonderful extension of the series of Harry Potter  Everyone  our family is  le to read  but Mom got to go first  I fished  2 days  Harry doesn't disappot wh me great stuff at Hogwarts  school  all our fave characters back aga  This might be a ltle  me &quotdark&quot than the early ones but I thk that #3 is me so  I loved the new wizard game    havg Harry  the gang grow up  just a ltle is very realistic There are lots of fun magical creatures   spells that go wrong to keep thgs excg  good does always w  out  the end  I like Harry's resourcefulness  the way most adults who  care about him are wise  helpful but let him figure out how to deal  wh problems too  I would recommend that parents follow the not younger  than 9 years ratg on  but no one  my family is under 19  we love  them all!  I can't wa f the next one
This book is brilliant i fished   one night this defely beats off all competion from the other three books  from most childrens fiction around at the moment But no book is perfect the real flaw  this is that the first few books were wrten f 6+ year olds but this one is  far too long  complicated f most people below 8  so i had no  trouble but i know several younger kids that did get bed  simply turn  away at the size of the book So this is a brilliant buy but  you  your  child is under 8 i'd suggest wag a few years
Wow!  We got our copy about noon on Saturday  I fished readg  outloud to my we  two daughters at 10pm Monday eveng  Can't wa f the next one!Rowlgs contues to show an credible grasp of the  English language as well as provide wonderful detail of an imagary  wld

I recieved this book on July 8 the day  came out planned to take a few days to read  Well I read   1 day 8hours to be exact It was that good While the book is undoubtedly scary  is hardly gruesome Rowlg also contues to provide her fans wh me fmation about the Wizardg Wld under the fluence of Ld Voldermt Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire has a plot full of twists  turns that Harry fans will not have expected  the endg will leave you astonished  eagerly wag f the fh book!
I thought  was the best out of all of them especially sce he's fourteen i can't wa f him to get older! The bummer is that Fred  Gege leave next year their my favoe characters!  I kda thk the  endg was a ltle weird but knowg the auth the whole thg will  reveal self wh time! Hope you can enjoy this book as much as i did!

Harry Potter IV The Goblet of Fire is everythg you've come to expect from JK Rowlg's awesome series  me Don't be surprised to fd the serpente plot twists friend--foe character examations  of course  hilarious antics from the Weasley tws You'll be entranced through all  734 pages- the only somewhat slow spot I found was the first chapter  Harry Ron  Hermoe are back better than ever  to come along on  the wild ride- just grab the book already!
If you could give me than five stars I would be the first one to give ten This book is absolutely wonderful! No wonder  sold millions of copies befe  was even released  I've noticed each Harry Potter  book gets better as  goes along If you liked the other books this one  will blow you away! Once you start readg you can't stop I read    less than two days I wrapped   plastic  dragged  along to swim  practice It was a good idea not to release  durg the school year as  you could probably hear the shouts of teachers throughout the country  sayg &quotput that book away&quot  &quotthis is Math class not a  school of wizardry!&quot  I couldn't possibly spoil the plot but I  will tell you that  will make you laugh histerically  some pots    you're sappy like me you will cry at others The rest of  just helps  to make this the best book I've ever read!  If you thk 's all hype   are just not sure read ! Even  you don't buy  brow  from a  friend And once you've gotten past the first chapter  realize you need  to have your own copy proceed to your nearest bookste  Amazoncom   ORDER NOW!  It may be darker than the others  may be huge   long  may sound bg but once you are lost  the sty  somehow  come backt ot he real wld you can't help but wish  was longer than s  impressive 734 pages  Go f  You'll enjoy readg about Harry's  crush  Hagrid's creatures I loved   I hope you do too!

This is the best yet of Harry Potter(As I said about the other books as well) I could not put  done I just kept turng the pages until 734 It's got some great suprises   as well as some disappotg moments Here's a quick summary of what the book is really about: When Harry go's to  the Wld Cup there is a very bad event that happens that is reveled at the  end of the book(very suprisg i must add)Then while bdg the Hogwarts  Express at Kg Cross Station  Harry Hermione  the Weasleys are told  somethg very excg will be happeng at Hogwarts that year which I may  add will be replacg Quiddich f that year ONLY! Who is gog to  compete from Hogwarts What Hagrid really is who the new DATDA teachers  will be who starts datg  will Voldemt come back? You'll have to  fd out yourself  the #1 Bestseller Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire!
As a college graduate one might be surprised that the book I was wag f most over the past few months was a so-called children's books  Well  any Harry Potter reader knows of the mixture of plot twists character   wonder the books conta  this book is no exception though  adds  some slightly me adult elements  issues I would be hurtg your  readg wh any spoilg fmation suffice  to say age 9  up is  an excellent readg level   the case of this series &quot  up&quot is que applicable these books are f children  adults  Not enough praise Solid solid read You won't put  down
This book was amazg I couldn't put  down I was fished wh a couple of hours I was realy under JK Rowlgs spell once I started readg Harry  his friends are older  me mature now so the  atmosphere changed que a b  the book I couldn't put  down because  of everythg gog on  the book every event every conversation had a  clue  somethg that they would mention then come back to   leave   on  off  so on It's like piecg a puzzle together  then you're  missg a few pieces At the end 's almost as  you fd the missg  pieces   all wks out  all makes sense  Brilliant I can't wa  f number five to come I want to see what Voldemt will do wh power  Goblet of Fire is the most wonderful breathtakg upsettg book yet
Wow This was an amazg book I just fished  a few mutes ago after readg straight f about fty-eight hours wh small breaks f the bathroom sleep  meals This is not as light-hearted as the other three  but  has all the classic features that you expect from a Harry Potter  book Harry starts at the Dursleys countg the days until he can go to  Hogwart's his beloved school He  his friends eat cauldron cakes on the  tra  attend the stg ceremony f a change  this book However  as Harry is now 14 years of age he makes smarter decisions  is less  awkward He is fally thkg me on the levels of a young adult rather  than a child This makes f a better book as he fully grasps the  implications of exactly what he goes through Harry makes noble choices  throughout the sty enrichg his character givg the reader a stronger  respect f him as a full character I ask you to read this book even   you have not read the other three It is by far the best f  is the  most scere of the four Harry Potter books
Rowlg was able to follow up &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot wh a great novel that shows a dferent side of Harry Potter Hagrid  all other characters It also troduces us to new characters some from two other  magic schools  Ld Voldemt makes a return   the process does a  brutal act that has all characters especially Harry  despair   sadness The new DADA (Defense Agast The Dark Arts) teacher has a strange  personaly  persona which makes this novel the best on my list It is  however sad  dark especially at certa parts at the end but the book  is great nevertheless
I went to this novel wholeheartedly expectg  to be great  I was certaly not dissapoted Mrs Rowlg has such a fantastic vocabulary  magnicent abily to put characters  suations that are  breathtakg yet makg  sound viable that anyone can enjoy her wks  Personally this one happens to be  a tight run wh Chamber of Secrets  so I would say that these Happen to be her best It is lengthy at times  but not  the sense of beg drab Harry Potter can never be drab  my  md No this book can just get  spots where she sets stuff up a ltle  slowly But let me say  everythg that leaves you wonderg through the  whole book is answered  perhaps the most magnicent fale that I have  ever put my eyes on Reade this book Love   pray f the next one to  come out sooner!
Although I thought that the book was unquestionablyentertag like many of the reviewers that have voiced their opion this fum I found the book to be lackg  the sense that  was not a good example of a self-contaed book that is part of a seriesUnlike the first three books this volume  the series seems to be playg upon an age-old marketg scheme usually used by the movie dustry  In the end  causes us to want f the next book of the series stead of feelg the lighteng of a burden usually received wh the resolution of a book  It leaves many questions unanswered  many secrets  the darkAlso I fd the dark febodg at the end of the book to be very similar to another great tale &quotThe Empire Strikes Back&quot Also a tale of epic proptions the Star Wars Trilogy also seems to follow this same pattern  The second (fth episode) stallment of the Star Wars series leaves us wh a dark fbodg  created a great hype f the third  fal Star Wars  And although  was a great movie  could not st alone as a movie whout the background of the first movie  resolution of the third movie  This was a marketg ploy by Gege Lucas the producer of the Star Wars seriesIt would seem to me that JK Rowlg took a page out of Lucas' book (so to speak) when she created the endg f this book  I do not want to give up too many details so I shall leave  at thatIn conclusion the book is a good  entertag book f all Harry Potter fans out there but leaves us screamg f the next stallment  However f the uniated I thk  would be wise to start wh one of the previous three books to immerse yourself to the magical wld of Potter befe attemptg this novel that is me entwed to the series than the rest
I've been wag f this book sce July  when I fally got  my mom fced me to stop readg   I've read   two days but I'm still readg  over aga
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is highly recommended  I'm defely not an avid reader as a matter a fact I don't read any book at all!   I've always heard of the Harry Potter books but never thought anythg of    The hype around this fourth book was sooooo huge that I just had to see  what everyone was talkg about  I bought the book  after just two  pages I was hooked!   This has been the only book that I have ever wanted  to fished  I can't stop readg!   If I can get hooked then so could  you  10 stars would have been me like 
This book was awesome!  Better than others wh 's danger that pulls you   Wh 's  great descriptions  the amount of imagation you possess this book seems real
Great tale!  Rowlg reaches out  grabs you  the first chapter  doesn't even let go  the last one  Harry Potter  all the other wizards  muggles seem very real  Harry when faced wh a dficult  decision always seems to take the high road although he does get  his  share of trouble which makes him seem pretty nmal f a wizard!  I  can't wa to see what will happen  Rowlg's 5th sty!
What a great book Rowlg has contued to grow  her wk this book cluded some great comedy as well as the darker issues I could not put  down If you liked the other Potter books this is great  you have not  read any potter books this is still good but a ltle confusg read the  other books first Can't wa f book 5
Remember how  Scooby Doo episodes there was all this runng around  then some guy would show up  expla everythg that had happened at the end of the show  Harry Potter is gettg like that  It would be nice to  figure thgs out along the way stead of comg up wh implausible  twists that only can be explaed  retropect
When i fally got Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire i was estatic i just sat  read f 8 hours straight  This book is so wth your time  THis book gives me fmation about Harry's past All  all a great book
  sry had to catch my breath  This book is SO amazgly cool  almost not even wth talkg about  JK Rowlg really did  this time she sure did wh a MASTERFUL weave of trigue  mystery srow  saturated wh the tat of undniable unfgivable  evil  To those skeptical readers out there readg this review bear   md that I am 15  generally not terested  this kd of stuff but  this book really grabbed me  I'm talkg less than 12 hours to fish kd  of grabbed  It is everythg a great wk of lerature should be   then some  Surprises ahead: don't even TRY to guess who  is f example  And ready yourself f a (wd that completely exels 'wonderful'   'excellent' I can't thk of one) conclusion wthy only of Harry Potter  Oh  case you haven't picked up on the subtle ht  this  reviewBUY!  THIS!  BOOK!  Or you will regret  when the local bookshop  runs out of copies
I found that I was gripped by the book  could not put  down  After I fished I thought &quotWhat a GREAT book!&quot  As I began to thk about the book Iwondered  some of the content may not be too much f  's targeted readers &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is me questionable   s content than the first three books  I advise parents to read this book  first  make there own decision  the content is right f their  children
This book is the most wonderful book I have ever read apart from the other Harry Potter books of course! Voldemt was me frightg than ever Harry me brave than ever  Snape me mean than ever! I loved   I  hope you will too
This was the best book of all of them It wasn't too excg when the book began but then  got so terestg  It seemed after a while that she went off of the subject of Ld Volemt (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named)   focused on a tnament that would disclude this book fm all seven but  then she made that apart of Ld Voldemt  If you are wonderg what i am  talkg about there not beg much Ld Voldemt until a while I'm  discludg the first chapter which had alot of him but then  started to  drt off of him as I got further to the book  The rums about there  beg a death to the book are true  She takes you by suprise when the  very second of gly turns deadly  Many of your fave characters are  back cludg Sirius Black Dobby Wmtail (Peter Pettigrew  Scabbars)  One character goes to vis Profess Lup but He is not wh the  returned characters
This was one of the best books  the series by far The plot was  engagg  the characters as always were out of this wld The best  part was that the auth kept givg you me  me surprises This  defately is much darker than the past few but the darkness helps give  this book me depth The next is sure to be a wner as well
Durg last school year I kept hearg people talk about Harry Potter books I didn't know what the big deal was but under the advise of my friends I decided to read them I was imediately swept up to them   could not wa f the fth one I got the book the night  came out   befe I read  I reread all 3 books so  was like pickg up where I  left off  I couldn't put  down  was most defatly the best book of  the series At the end I hardly could control myself  cried  touched  me so much
Rowlg is honestly the best thg sce CS Lewis  Seuss!  The plots  the Potter books are gettg me elabate  darker as Harry gets older Image what he'll be gettg to his 6th year?  Anyone who  doesn't enjoy Book 4 hasn't read any of the rest Remember It's a  series!  Don't pick  up unless you already have  fully tend to read  the first three!
I love Harry Potter I've read all the books several timesI waed fever f this book to come out!  I really liked this book except f the first  second to the last chapters because they were too scary f  younger readers  I thk that  really shows you that Harry is growg  up  He learns about friendship  loyalty  JK Rowlg has a special way  of wrg that makes you feel like you're  the sty  I recommend this  book f older readers[Mus 1 star f beg too scary]
I just fished this book  all I can say is &quotWOW&quot This is easily the most complex of the books so far It is also the longest F some younger readers I would suggest readg the last couple chapters  eher wh parents   the bright light of day Some parts of this book  would not make good bedtime sties I also suggest not rushg through the  book As I said  is very complex  can be confusg  you get thgs  messed up Enjoy!
I thk the sty was too long to mata the same level of suspense as  previous books (possibly because her fans had rushed JKRowlg a b?)  The plot is not as tight as that  previous books  at pots  the sty turns to a meerg ramble about Harry's  his friends'  lives their crushes their histies a partyNonetheless  has  some really terestg new characters  some very ventive ideas about  the the magical wld (veela are hysterical)  I consequently stayed up  until 1am to fish readg   Basically  you're a fan buy the book  so you're up-to-date on Harry's le  If you haven't read JKRowlg's  books befe read book 1  2 befe you attempt this one
As an adult I was at first hesant to read the Harry Potter series  Afraid that the books couldn't possibly hold my terest long enough to complete the series  I have four children  I bought the first three  books as a Christmas gt  Durg a period of heavy snows I(at least f  NJ) my husb read them  recommended that I read them  Fantastic!  I went to school wh all of these people I had these teachers  It is  very real  JK Rowlgs prose is amazg  as an ex-English maj I  would recommend these books to anyone!
I'm 24  I have been enchanted by Harry Potter once aga  J K Rowlg knows how to wre at me than one level  that makes her books entertag f everyone  The fourth book longest so far is still a  fast read  still leaves you wh a good feelg side  I'm on the edge  of my seat wag f Book 5 to see where Harry Potter's adventures will  lead me next
Wow seldom have I been that unable to put a book down Especially over the last 150 pages there is tremendous speed deep emotion nerve-wreckg tension It is true this book contas me dark elements than the earlier  ones  is me cruel But then children get me cruelty on one night of  TV-wachtg then  this book The language is defely gettg me  grown-up me earnest as Harry  his friends grow up themselves This   the end of the book really leave me lookg fward to next summer  Cheer up  only about 360 days to go!
I LOVED this book Instead of gettg wse as most series do Harry Potter gets better  better I tried so hard to save  but ended up  fishg   a day I deeply admire JK Rowlg's abily to wre  Everythg that happens  her sties happens f a reason  I enjoy  how all of her separate styles ends up combg  a spectacular way  You will never guess the endg  this book It was a huge surprise f  me as were the endgs to her previous books Also I swear that her  characters seem so real that 's unreal The only thg I hate about Harry  Potter is that  always leaves you hangg On to book 5!
I am 26  I was on ps  needles wag f this book I loved this book from begng to end It was not as light as the other three but we were warned  I was hooked from the begng My palms were sweatg right  along wh Harry's Ron's Hermione's  all the readers' palms I loved  Mad-Eye Moody  his demonstration of the Aveda Kedavra It made me thk  like so many other pots  the book Everyone is growg  learng  Strugglg I'm not makg much sense but after readg this I'm all  jumbled up Don't wa buy a copy today Then wre JK  Scholastic   BEG f Book 5!
Well I am one of the older Potter fans What really amazes me about this series is that  is universal all ages can enjoy  Though I do adm when first suggested to read this series I was cynical about whether I  would like  I did though! I read all of the first three  a week  rushg to the book ste to purchase them I just couldn't put them down  Of course like the rest of the Potter fans I was eagerly awag the  newest of the books I loved !I did notice that this one was a great deal  darker The only sadness  fishg this volume was realizg that I most  wa until the next one comes out
What a wonderful adventure! I could not put  down JK Rowlg is truely gted As a friend of me said &quotI wish I had books like this to read when I was young I would have been much me to readg&quot I  am sry that I read  so fast Now the long wa f number 5 There was  an article  Newsweek about whether  not these book will become  &quotclassics&quot I am sure they will!
Me brilliant albe simple wrg from Rowlg  By simple meang 's not pretentiously overwrten like many of the books that NPR likes to highlight but not simple like a meangless romance novel  other such  tre entertament  Although I am an adult I love these books  can  read them over  over especially this one which is very true to the  style fmed  the first book but also dferent  that the plot wrg  is not stuck  a fmulaic system like some book series can get to  especially many children's books series If I were a small child this is  absolutely what I would be lookg f  what I did look f as a child  - I read Asimov's Three Adventurers Encyclopedia Brown  other  challengg bra-based children's fiction that also have the great  adventure  children-gettg-the-upper-h-over-the-adults scenarios  that can make a child feel less helpless  give one some hope  Harry  Potter has all that  has a lot of   I can't recommend the series  enough f adults  f youth  I am so happy that f once a super  popular book is actually somethg that is well-wrten  not an sult  to the telligence  one's aesthetic sensabily - I am so amazed at  this because so few people seem to ever exhib any telligence   aesthetic sensibily that the cynic  me would assume that this series  would have failed on the first book f beg not-stupid-enough f the  mass audience  Thank God somethg clicked  people's heads that they are  willg to exple  challenge themselves a ltle b me beyond  sipid love sties  potless  poly wrten action/adventure  booksThree cheers f Harry Potter!
As soon as I recieved the book from Amazoncom  the mail I knew what to do  I put down the mop  started to read  By that night I had fished  I couldn't believe what I had just read  I flipped the last page of  the book  hoped f me  But all I could manage to fd was the back  cover  It seemed as   wouldn't be right f the book to stop there  but  had  I couldn't believe what had happened  I had used almost an  entire day to uncover the secret the first chapter had began  found that   only lead to another  I would be fced to wa until the next book  came out  I hope  will soon! And enjoy the goblet of fire you're  f  a real treat!
I was shocked  dismayed at the endg of this book  I thk the content  message f those children under 15 will be too dficult f them to take until the next book comes out  I am 38  I'm not sure that  I will be able to take   In a wld where children have to deal wh so  many burdens this books leaves children thkg &quotHow on earth can  Harry Potter deal wh this?&quot  The thgs that JK leaves Harry  responsible f are just too dficult f the younger set to deal wh  These books wk because they follow the fmula -- one where the book ends  upbeat  This one was very very distressgAlso JK Rowlg's use of  unusual names makes  dficult to read the book out loud to anyone  She  should clude an appendix that has the pronunciations  Who would have  thought that was how you pronounced Hermione's name?  Now I'm self  conscience whenever I read  to my son
This is the way I would've wrten a Harry Potter book  Not too sappy not too dark plenty of action  even some killg  Defely the best  the series (much better than No 3 which was just pla terrible)  Harry Potter books will never be my all-time faves but f an  entertag diversion they are hard to beat
At first the book was funny about Harry blowg up his aunt others then afterwards  got me  me excg Of courseI still had some laughs now  then  the middle of the book but at the end I was terried but happy at the thought of Harry gettg back safely(Well not that safely but que) I really hope to see what other excg books JKRowlg will wre about Harry Potter
All I have to say is &quotWOW!&quot  JK Rowlg has really out done her self this time wh the 4th book to the Harry Potter series  I have never  my le read a 752 pg book  ONE day  I can't wa to read the  next book
This book blew away all the other books iv'e read was the best
Even though the fourth Harry Potter book was a good book  my opion  wasn't the best out of the four  I didn't like how a character died even though I knew  would be comg  I also thought the first chapter  was confusg  even when I fished there are some parts I couldn't  figure out  Book 3 was my fave because  talked a lot about Harry's  parents  how they died  Even so I thought Book 4 was really good
These are great books f children AND f adults Harry Potter is a classic hero -- brave chivalrous  modest The auth seems to be givg us the education of a modern day wizard/knight  this series I'm lookg  fward to the adult Harry I thk I'll like him very much  that he's  dested to be a hero f me than what happened to him as a baby I also  liked the further character development of friend Ron who understably  wants to be me than Harry's sidekick  Hermione a bray heroe wh  a social conscience who still gets the guy The books are gettg darker  but kids are capable of understg that a battle between good  evil  will result  some casualties The death  this book was necessary
Ever wonder why all the fuss about Harry Potter?  If you do you haven't been readg the Harry Potter series  Auth JK Rowlg has h on somethg very speciala character that everyone but most especially  boys really care about Harry is a good hearted unspoiled brave boy who  has the resilience to bounce back when his friends (sometimes his best  friends) turn their backs on him  Harry meets the evil Voldemt once  aga  book four wh chillg results This is a book f a me mature  audience as Harry grows up so has the content level  As an adult I can  tell you I love them all but especially Harry Potter IV!
Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire was a good book although i don't thk  was as good as any of the previous Harry Potter books  The book focuses a lot on Harry's relationships wh his friends  teachers    didn't really get excg until near the endIn this year at  Hogwarts school of magic Harry faces the many new experiences cludg  the Triwizard Cup The Yule Ball  a lot of new characters  J K  Rowlgs' excellent sense of wds  dialogue make the book a pleasant   fun read
I thought this was by far the best one she had ever wrt! There were a cupple of thgs i would have changed but i thought  was great!
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  The Goblet of Fire had me spellbound  I couldn't put  down until I had fished readg every page  I was laughg so had that my sides hurt wh Fred  Gege's ventions  scared to turn out the lights becaue of &quotYou-Know-Who&quot's  reappearance  cryg my heart out as Harry mourns (Dare I adm that  I'm 43 years old?  I would have fished readg sooner but I was readg   aloud to my 3 children who sat still f 3 long days!)  Who needs a  rollercoaster ride when Harry Potter is here?
I have almost fished the book  I can't wa f the endg  Whoever has been reviewg  f the newspapers  magazes has totally missed the mark!  The book is about true friendship  what  means to be a true  friend  I thk that every character is well developed  excg  I  can't wa f the next one  This is 734 pages of heavenly readg!
&quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot absolutely lives up to the rest of the &quotHarry Potter&quot series  These books are a great way of gettg children  even adults volved  readg  They are not too elementary  f an adult to read them but still easy to read  underst f  children  The Goblet of Fire is full of adventure keepg you on the  edge of your seat  I stayed up until about 3:00  the mng readg    fished the second day I got   Judgg by the end of &quotThe  Goblet&quot I can tell that the fth book will be one of the best  I  just wish I knew when  will be released!
This book was so good that I actually had to fight wh my sister to read   Fally I sat next to her on the couch  we both read  at the  same time holdg the book open both to the page where she was  the  page where i was  It is defately wth readg  I'm defately gog  to buy the next book when  comes out
i have read all of the harry potter books  i have no idea how she gets all the spiration to make them! they are the best books i have ever read  the best thg is they keep on gettg bigger  bigger! that way i  can enjoy them longer befe i have the longgly wa f the next to come  out  boy i can't wa! i read this one  6 hours straight i didn't do  anythg else even eat! i was to enthralled wh the book i couldn't put   down!  i don't know how anyone could not like these books because they  are the best ever!  i can't wa f book 5!
I THINK THAT THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME I LIKED THE ACTION AND SUSPENSE THAT WAS WITHIN THE BOOK I RECOMENED THIS BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS  FICTIONAL STORIES THE AUTHOR WRITES THE BOOK SO THAT IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE ACTUALLY THERETHIS BOOK WAS GREAT!
It was just too long  And there were muggles volved  a non-muggle spt Quiddich  It did'n't make sense  It was ok  But I was bed some what wh !
This book has the potential of beg the Greatest book ever I read the book everyday after wk I thk that The Goblet of Fire is my all time fave so far  the seriesThe non-stop action  adventure kept my  eves glued to the pages when I fished I was wantg 200  me pages I  did not want the book to end I am tellg all my friends! You can not  enjoy readg any me than readg the sties about Harry Potter  all  his friends I can not wa f Book 5! 
Okay I fished this book about five mutes ago  okay say I'm  sensive  whatever but  is really sad!  The person who dies TOTALLY  doesn't deserve to (but that's the way  wks I guess right?)  the  end really left  open which of course is not nessecarily (sp?) a bad  thg but stillAnyway this book is far me serious than the  others  the end was a real shock (at least to me) Nevertheless  is  still an excellent book  I hope that Ms Rowlg can provide some  answers  her next book which I will be eagerly awag! :)Oh   anyone wants to talk to me about    any1's fav character is Ron  Fred Lup  Dumblede (those are me!) please email me at  gnome47@homecom
As this is the fourth book of a seven-book series I was anticipatg somethg  the way of &quotIndiana Jones: Temple of Doom&quot  &quotThe Empire Strikes Back&quot: a filler wh a great act to follow   a great act to live up to  Rowlg proved me wrong  I love her f  !The series follows the travails of a young boy gog through seven  years of school  as all good journeyman books should go this series is  true to his age durg each book  We see Harry  his friends maturg  gettg social conscience (Hermione &amp the house-elves)  startg  adolescence  There are suations showg class-ism (Ron has a problem  wh Harry havg money &amp fame) racism (the Death Eaters tture   ba the muggle camp groundskeepers)  tragic family dynamics (one of  the ma sub-plots deals wh a son killg his father)  Rowlg does not  soften the blow of death  ttureThe strong resemblance between  Harry  Voldemt gets fleshed out  this book: their each havg a  muggle parent growg up as phans Hogwarts beg their first exposure  to magic they are parseltongues (talk to snakes) their ws beg lk  to Dumblede's phoenix  Where they dfer is  the choices they make:  Harry chooses Gryffd even though the stg hat thought he would do  well  Slyther Harry chooses to let Peter Wmtail go stead of  allowg his murderHermione  Ron's characters are well-developed  Ron's development is terestg  that there is stre  his  relationship wh Harry: they fight outright Ron is extremely jealous of  Harry's fame  wealth Harry is callous  his treatment of Ron while  they are &quotenemies&quot  Hermione on the other h plays mediat   takes up the cause of the house-elves who are the servants of the  households  Hogwarts  She also gets asked to the Ball by the Belgian  Seeker Ron's idol thereby provg her attractiveness  There are signs of  Ron's terest  her which he cannot yet see but I am sure will get  developed  future booksI could go on fever but I strongly  recommend  you have read this review so far that you read the book!terest  her which he cannot yet see but I am sure will get  developed  future booksI could go on fever but I strongly  recommend  you have read this review so far that you read the book!
After readg the first three books of the series  wag f the latest one I must say  was wth the wa  It captured all the  desperation  past plot les that made the third book so cool   developed the characters well just like  the first two books  I loved  how the sty le shts to another darker tone wh the arrival of  Voldemt which will carry on to the fal three books  Once aga  Rowlg tricked wh her clever characters  use of magic to expla the  plot  I just wish I hadn't fished  on July 12
In my opion this is the best Harry Potter book yet! If you liked the previous books  this series then get ready f a twisted  tantalizg  sty This book is like the first three rolled to one! Non-stop action    even some mystery I started  as soon as I got   couldn't  put  down Even  you don't like magic I thk you'll like this book
I would give this book 10 stars  I could  I didn't thk she could do  but JK Rowlg surpassed the Prisoner of Azkaban tenfold  I read the entire book wh 24 hours of recievg -I just can't beg to say how  good  is  This series won't consist of kid's books anyme-Harry's  magical wld has darkened  People are dyg  they're people we got to  know not just memies  There is an tensely emotional qualy  the  fourth book that wasn't present  the other three  f the first time  when the book ends thgs are not completely okay  Sce there is nothg  left to say that hasn't been said  that would give plotles away I can  only say that this book is my absolute fave
A wthy well-wrten companion to the first three this year's chronicle of adventures at Hogwart's  elsewhere  the wizardg wld makes f a  fabulous readg experience I laughed a lot me than usual (the HELF?  Dressg Muggle?)  admired the subtle ptrayal of the changes the young  people are gog through much to their bewilderment What a wonderful  series!
I wre this review from the stpot of the PARENT of a great fan of Harry Potter (my 7 1/2 year old son)  The explos of Year Four are by far the most fascatg  dramatic of all of the volumes  This is an  outstg book but I would ask you to be considerate of your child's  reactions to the sty as  unfolds  The emotional toll is heavier than   has been  the first three volumes  Year Four marks a dramatic  turng pot f Harry Potter  He discovers the larger wizardg wld   many ways  As always there is the delightful  the humous but the  dark  sister side of wizard le is thrust to the fe as well  Me  Weasleys are troduced (Fred  Gege have even me entertag  practical jokes  schemes) the Quiddch Wld Cup is played Hagrid has  me fascatg magical creatures the awkwardness of teenage crushes   boy-girl relationships gets me attention (Hargid even has his moment)   as always Ron Harry  Hermione have all sts of escapades  But the me sister  reprehensible reach an all time high  Year  Four  The cruelty that can be exhibed by hateful  prejudiced people  (the followers of Ld Voldemt) is described me fully  vividly  Excellent examples of the ease wh which people (wizards) can subjugate  others (house-elves)  deem them less wthy by arbrary characteristics  (Mudbloods) are brought out  both new  familiar characters  Most  powerfully  this was distressg to me as the father of a VERY YOUNG  Harry Potter fan the capacy to take human le whout remse is  ptrayed twice  F the first time a Hogwarts student is murdered  Havg wnessed my son's reaction to the execution of Buckbeak  Year  Three I am deeply concerned about how he will respond to the death of a  student  Year Four  Harry Potter is a wonderful fictional hero  a  stybook le filled wh tremendous adventures  His triumph  Year Four  does not come easily n does  leave you wh the same lightness of  spir you may have experienced wh the earlier volumes  Rowlg a  skilled auth  hles the &quottraumas&quot of the sty  honable   tasteful ways but they rema emotionally challengg f younger  children  Let your child enjoy this book (wh you?)  be prepared to  talk about   This stimulatg  sophisticated novel will stay wh  your child f a long timey n does  leave you wh the same lightness of  spir you may have experienced wh the earlier volumes  Rowlg a  skilled auth  hles the &quottraumas&quot of the sty  honable   tasteful ways but they rema emotionally challengg f younger  children  Let your child enjoy this book (wh you?)  be prepared to  talk about   This stimulatg  sophisticated novel will stay wh  your child f a long time
I have just fished this book  I personally thk  is the best out of the Harry Potter series so far It brgs  two other schools  the wizardg wld  the suspence is tremendous I was stg on the edge  of my seat the whole way through the book JK Rowlg did an EXCELLENT  job this time aroundI was nervous when Harry was nervous about(I  can't say'll ru a big part of the book) That's another thg she  keeps you wonderg what is gog to happen next  yes somebody DOES  die but I won't say who If you are a Harry Potter fan you absolutely  MUST read this book but by the time you read this review you'll probably  be about half way through  so you don't need me tellg you to One of  the best books I have ever readIt is a b LONG though as you may   may not have noticed  : )
I thk this book was a wonderful  strategic addion to the Harry Potter series  In previous books (as i am sure all of you readg this are well aware  have read all four booksok maybe all three so far) Harry has only come to face Voldemt when he was very weak  vunerable thus  makg Harry's w a struggle but never the less possible  In this book  Voldemt comes back to play not  que full strength but strong enough  not to use someone else's body  only be a memy This book's plot was  needed to contue the suspense of Harry's le (otherwise we'd all  probably get bed readg that there's  always a chance that Voldemt  might return to power)  It's plot was stirrg  kept you on your feet  wh a ltle detective wk(like  all the books)  of course hum  Ms Rowlg i feel covers all of the genres  some aspect  another   all of the Harry Potter series  She's led yet another great book  People ask why everyone likes  so much  i thk 's because we wish  this wld could actually exist Who wouldn't love to be someone else wh  a ltle Polyjuice Potion?  Her books brg out imagation that this wld  could use a ltle me ofSo thanks Ms Rowlg f wakg us all up!  PS On page 724 first paragraph there are a set of quotation marks  missg(on my copy anyway) You may fd  your book that Dumblede's  speech to the students that begs on page 723 doesn't end wh quotations!  i'm sure there are many me blunders but this one stood out to methanx  f readg this  have fun wh the book!
Everyone  my family (myself my husb  two sons 16  11) has been eagerly awag the release of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire along wh the millions of other adg fans wldwide It was wth the  wa! Ms Rowlg has very effectively shown how Harry  his friends are  growg up Even the vocabulary seems me advanced than  the earlier  sties  The plot is meticulously crafted at the begng of the sty  we encounter He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named who has plans f Harry that are  darker than ever  The pa  Harry's lightng-bolt scar lets him know  that trouble volvg Voldemt is ahead  as he returns to Hogwarts  f his fourth year he is thrust agast his will to a yearlong  competion f the Triwizard Cup which proves to be the greatest test yet  of Harry's maturg powers as a wizard As  much classic lerature the  struggle between good  evil becomes ever me imptant  this  stallment I found myself thkg back to Tolkien's The Ld of the  Rgs It is hard to say too much me about the sty whout revealg  what happens but once aga Ms Rowlg has ved all of us no matter  what our ages to her parallel universe where we laugh cry celebrate   suffer wh Harry Hermione Ron Hagrid Dumblede  all the  others
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is probally the best Harry Potter yet Many great sub-plots are added to this novel F stance the Weasley tws  their series of magical novelties had me laughg out loud Harry Potter is a combation of many dferent types of wrtg It is an  Adventure Fantasy  Mystery all  one I hope the next 3 books of the  7 are as good as this one
In this fourth stallment of the Harry Potter books the tle character  his friends face new delights  new dangers as a secondary character moves to a me primary sphereThe Goblet of Fire parallels s  predecesss  part by begng wh Harry's stay on Privet Drive wh  the Dursleys He is rescued from this sad suation by the Weasleys who  ve him rather humously to the Quiddch Cup Tournament Under  duress his uncle allows him to go The tournament self is a success but  activies that follow afterward unleash chaos at the Mistry of Magic  Meanwhile at Hogwarts Harry fds that they must fsake Quiddch as  the spt of choice  fav of the Triwizard Cup TournamentRowlg  clearly shows that Harry  his friends are maturg  their fourth year  The Triwizard Cup Tournament especially releases pent up resentments   a number of fatuations Harry shows the development of a mal fiber that  clearly surpasses those around him as he tries to dodge unwanted help   unwanted press  his struggle as the unprecedented fourth champion  the  Triwizard Cup TournamentWhout givg anythg of imptance away   terms of plot I'd like to say that Rowlg is clearly movg on to me  serious matters The entire atmosphere of the book contas moments of  tension  mountg anxiety that will keep you turng the pages to  discover how the plot thickens  develops Rowlg's credible talent  keeps the suspense buildg throughout the book The Goblet of Fire will  leave you lookg fward to Harry Potter V
J K Rowlg has created another masterpiece  At first  was a ltle hard gettg to this book followg the first three but by the end I could not put  down  Rowlg has masterfully carried over the old plots  created an epic new one  I simply can not wa until her next  stallment
I could not wa to get my hs on the next book  the Harry Potter series  From the moment I opened   read the 1st page I was hooked  I totally devoured this book  It was just so credible  engrossg that  I hated f  to end  From the Quiddch Wld Cup to the Triwizard  Tournament is was all just so great  I CANNOT wa until Harry Potter 5!  I thk I am already gog thru whdrawal  So to everyone out  theredo not miss out on HP 4!
This has brought my son age 14 (haven grown wh Harry) pleasure joy  a wickedly fantastical weekend readg like a love-starved puppy  I also listened to all 20 hours of the audio cassette  This stallment  a  series that is so overwhelmgly wonderful is self wonderful  Though  the book is a ltle me graphic then the other three  is no me  frighteng  contues to come up wh new  imagative mal  lessons  fun  general  A totally engrossg time f all
JK Rowlg said  a recent terview that this was her fave Harry Potter book so far  I absolutely agree  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a fast-paced thriller that has left me dyg to read the next book   the series
One of the best books I have ever read It has so many unexpected events Childern of all ages can read this book
This book was sooooooooooo good! I don't thk  was wth the big deal but  was still better than all the other books I've read exept the Prisoner of AzkabanOn Saturday I couldn't put  down till 1  the  mng I kept readg  till I fished on Sunday It was great!
JK Rowlg has wrten yet another wonderful wk about Harry Potter  his time at Hogwarts I read  all  one day -- I didn't want to stop readg The book didn't seem excessively long to me In fact  seemed almost too sht -- not once did I wish that the part I was readg would go faster I read a LOT of books  I haven't had that happen sce I read "The Grippg H" by Larry NivenIt appears now that the first 3 books were merely prelude to the "real" sty that begs wh this book "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" answers some questions but asks even me It's a perfect "to be contued" kd of book because  left me feelg like a complete sty was told but also feelg anxious f meHarry is 3 years older than he was  the first book   shows He is enterg the most harrowg spe-chillg frighteng period of his le -- he's discoverg girls Also a very powerful evildoer is tryg to kill him It's almost a toss-up which gives him  his friends the most trouble at least early on It's nice to read a series of books about teenagers who actually age  change Nobody wry though Harry's still a really nice boy even  he is still somewhat of a typical teenager After all teenage le is hard enough even whout people tryg to kill you  Harry has all the troubles of young adulthood In sht he's growg up  just  time tooThe new characters troduced  this book are excellent  serve to advance (  some cases twist) the plot que well I'm lookg fward to seeg some of them  future books I'm also becomg very curious about Snape but I'm sure we'll fd out me  the next bookIn conclusion: A great book! Buy  now! Buy copies f your family  friends! :-) I hope you all love  as much as I did The only problem is now I can't wa f the next book to come out! Wre faster JK! :-)
Jk Rowlg is the best auth of this century! She keeps comg back wh great sties! This one the best!  It had love death &amp hatred! Even though  had 700+ pages i read   one day  half! Got me hooked  like so many others You got to have imagation to read these  maybe  you dont! But readg Harry Potter helps kids all over America who never  read than what was assigned to them  class! RECOMMEND!
Don't want to give out much fmation but  was even better than the all the first three books combed The first chapter is about a dream (of Harry's) though  may not seem like that at first There is of course the  Quddch Wld Cup wh a suprise appearence of a symbol There is also a  competetion featurg BeausbatonsAcademy  Durmstrang Insture of  magic very exg- also love's abuzz- read ! It's a very well-  rounded book wh action emotions flyg  aS P E W - a ltle  somethg Hermonie has developied You will be suprised Also of course a  battle agast Ld Voldemt- much me bloody than the rest along wh a  death
I absolutely LOVED this book! It is the best yet The characters are great (as always)  so is the plot It's a lot longer than all the others but the plot is a lot me complicated so 's okay You have got to read this!
When I closed the book I immediately raced to the ternet to search f the prtg date of the fth book  That is the highest compliment I can give to Rowlg's fast-paced page turner which has left her many fans  (cludg me) screamg f me   Her brilliant character development   the first three books have bonded her readers to the times of happess  anger  sheer terr that Ron Hermione Harry  many other characters  experience  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Some auths stick to  the simple plots  children's books that brg at the most sht giggles  to the resolution of the petty problems  Rowlg is above that  I  applaud her f her courage to break the barrier between books f children   books f adults wh this grippg tale that has brought to me  everythg from squeals of delight to tears of sadness  I anxiously awa  Harry's fth year at Hogwarts
The 4th Harry Potter book is GREAT! Why? Because JKRowlg used a lot of imagation (makg up all the spells  comg up wh the Triwizard Tournament)  Compared wh the first 3 's much longer but  has  me suspense  surprises The book is also easier to read than other  books I have read: The Hobb Ld of the Rg - f example (although  their sties are also excg) It's SOOOO good that I couldn't put   down- so I fished   2 days wh time f shoppg  swimmg (I  had to go wh my parents)  The part when Harry goes to a real  Quiddch match gets really exg (Wh the Dark Mark  Death  eaters-the servants of Ld Voldemt) Most of the new characters come  from the other wizardg schools(like Durmstang)  When Dumblede  anounces that Hogwarts will be participatg  the Triwizard Tournament  the whole school was exed Who gets to represent Hogwarts? (Only anyone  over 17) But you can guess who I bet  The other night 2 ladies were  argug on TV over wether Harry Potter was a good book  not One of them  said  was bad because of wchcraft wches  spells The other one  said that Harry Potter was a good book f kids to read because 's only  fantasy I agree wh her  like science fiction  I can tell 's not  REAL Harry is not on the bad side- he's agast   he is fightg   Harry Potter books are fun to read  they're really terestg  too!
I absolutely LOVED this book!  I thk 's the best harry Potter book out of the whole trilogy  From the Quiddch wld cup to the Triwizard Tournament from Mad-eye Moody to the appearance of You-Know-Who from Ra  Skeeter to Mr Crouch  his son this was a great book!  Just because   was a 734 page book that didn't stop me!  (I read   less than four  days)  Havg to wa f this book really added suspence to the whole  thg  I thk that  you are a Harry Potter fan ( even  you aren't)  then this is a defate must read!  Come on everybody read Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire!
Readg JK Rowlg's latest Potter (Harry Potter  the Gobletof Fire) is like meetg up wh an old friend It all feels sofamiliar but don't be fooled by nostalgia The first chapter is a chillg remder that evil lurks  Harry had better watch his back Readers won't be disappoted but they will be shocked by some events  Rowlg sweeps you to Harry's magical wld once me makg you feel as  you never really left  END
After devourg Book 4 Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  two days I couldn't be me frustrated Now I have to wa another year f the next Harry Potter book!  JK Rowlg weaves a tale as few auth's can If the  fact that these books are published as children's fiction is deterrg  adults from readg them they are missg a rich tale of magic  friendship adventure love  the nature of evil This fourth book shows  an adolescent Harry Potter  as Harry matures so does the style As  promised by the auth this sty is darker than the first three the  characters are &quotdatg&quot  we learn me about Voldemt our  hero Harry's nemesis  the nature of his evil power Whout givg  anythg away the last chapters are page-turners  give us a glipse of  what is to come  future sties as Harry matures  contues to fight  evil  his magical wld I f one can't wa until Book 5 of the Harry  Potter series is published  I sure hope JK Rowlg wres fast!
Yes! Harry's a great hero aga but this time he doesn't feel like a true hero! Read to fd out how Harry tackles his 4th year at Hogwarts  how Hagrid fds a close friend! This book had so many me  &quotcharmg&quot magical details I know my 4th graders will read all  734 pages!
This latest  the Harry Potter series was a real treat f those who were lookg f me believable action  the sty les  As Harry grows up he is begng to learn that not every problem can be solved immediately  I thk that this element from &quotreal le&quot is one of her best  improvementsMy concern throughout the series has been whether  not  the evil characters  the sties will contue to be evil enough to keep  children from wantg to emulate them  This book was much me graphic  but I thought Rowlg has contued to do a good job of keepg evil  &quotevil&quotGood book!
The fourth book  this series is another wonderful tale full of adventure  surprises JK Rowlg has weaved another adventure f Harry  his buddies at the Hogwarts school as well as tempts readers wh what will  happen  the next book Kids will love the book It is full of new  creatures  teaches many lessons especially ones dealg wh how to  treat others Great readg!
The fourth stallment of Harry Potter is not only twice as long as any of s predecesss  also strays somewhat from her established fmula  It is still plot driven but because the plot is much me complicated  the  number of characters has creased I can see why some people may be put  off ially  But be assured that Rowlg knows what she is dog  It's  wonderfully entertag  at the same time provides me emotional  fullfillment than her earlier books  The only drawback of readg this  book so quickly is that  will be that much longer until the next one
Don't let the size of JK Rowlg's latest Harry Potter adventure scare you away  Its mesmerizg plot makes  a very fast read  Here are my Top 10 Reasons to Read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire: 1  Fred &amp Gege's Ten-Tongue Toffee  Canary Creams 2  Blast-Ended Skrewts  a  Hungarian Hntail 3  Veela  Leprechans' Gold 4  Ra Skeeter  her  Quick-Quotes Quill 5  Quiddch Wld Cup Souvenirs 6  The Dark Mark   Death Eaters 7  The Ptkey:  A Ticket to anywhere ( EVERYWHERE) 8  Mad-Eye Moody:  CONSTANT VIGILANCE 9  Ld Voldemt--HEEE'S BAAAACK!  10 Harry Potter who once aga exhibs the tras of friendship loyalty   the determation to do the right thg even when faced wh  fmidable foes  overwhelmg circumstances  James  Lily would be  proudMy advice is that you have plenty of time to fish the book  because once you start chapter thirty-one THE THIRD TASK you will not put   down until you're through
This is the best book I've ever read The way Harry solves some of the problems  the book is unbelievable I couldn't put this book down I speant 7 straight hours readg  The legnth of the book is a ltle over  whelmg at first I reccommend this book to anyone
After wag  a long le f over an hour  a half at 12:25 am on July the 9th the book America  I had eagerly  impatiently been awag was me  I was exhilerated  yesa b wried Would  #4 live up to the promise of the of previous three books? Warily I opened  Goblet of Fire while lyg on my couch at 1 am that night at 8:40am I  closed the book me than satisfied to declare this the Best Harry Potter  Book YET!  Darker? Yes But defately wth every mute I spent   wag this last year The only problem I can honestly say I have is that  I have to wa yet another YEAR f the next stallment of my fave  wizard  his charmg friends The last chapter of #4 is labeled  &quotThe Beggg&quot  deed  isthe begg of another year  long vigil but I am happy to say an undoubtedly wthwhile one just as  this past years was Way to Go Ms Rowlg You spire us all young   old
GREAT BOOK ! I couldn't put  down I read the entire book  less than one day You really should read Books 12  3 first though It will make me sense that way I love the characters  the plot I'm a technology  teacher  I've encouraged other teachers to use this book (  the first  three) as part of their language arts courses I have a 4 month old  daughter  I can't wa f her to be old enough so I can read the whole  series to her ! Some people say this is a children's book ~ not so !  Children of any age will enjoy these magical tales of wizards wches   scary creatures Read the Goblet of Fire ~ 's so good you won't want to  put  down
This the fourth  longest Harry Potter is a watershed book  many ways  Harry is no longer a lost ltle 11-year-old phan crgg away from his bullyg uncle  He is now a rapidly maturg self-assured  14-year-old young man  He has come face-to-face wh hrs most people  only experience  their nightmares  He has faced them  survived  This  has matured him  He bristles at beg called &quotltle boy&quot  And  yet he still is frightengly aware of his limationsHarry  Ron are  startg to notice those strangest  most frightful of all creatures --  girls!  Their friend Hermione is on the same voyage of discovery though  from the oppose direction  This sailg  uncharted waters provides  some of the most enjoyable sections of the whole novelThe book is a  watershed  atmosphere too  Ld Voldemt returns to power leavg   shambles the nice tidy magical wld we all know from the previous novels  The process by which he returns provides the darkest  most tense  scenes yet from Rowlg's pen  Parents of young Potter fans may wish to  read the first chapter to determe  their dividual child is up to  Joanne Rowlg is a master at subtle detail  Her characters leap  from the page fully fmed  The mental images of the scenery are crisp   clean  It is only when the book explicably loses that touch  spots  that  begs to fail  Sizable chunks seem devoid of   This leaves the  reader wh a feelg of completeness  Perhaps 700+ pages were a ltle  too much f even Rowlg's sty-tellg geniusBut these are mere  quibbles  This is a wthy book to be read  re-read f many years to  comeEnjoy!
When I first saw this I said wow thats alot of pages  I didn't know how the auth could put that musch fmation   These books are my fave because no auth has gone this way bef  I luv how everythg fs together  the end!  I read this  one dday that is how good  is!
I'm 28 I'm a graduate student  I really love Harry Potter In this book dferent from the first three 's me emotional sce Harry  his friends get older It's the start pot that Harry  friends start  realizg about each other as &quotboys  girls&quot But as 's  always shown  every book the fredship  carg among Harry Ron   Hermione is still be found ( to be honest  always makes me happy)        This new adventure of Harry is much me dangerous than he ever had  befe cludg the rebirth of the Dark ld which caused a death of  somebody (you have to read  to fd out who he was) JK Rowlg also  gave some mysteries that you have to fd out  her followg books This  book is just not f kids Recommended!
I thk the book was great but  lacked hum that the otherthree had I thk  deserves five stars because of all thesuspense It was me serieus (wrong sp) than the others though But all  all  was a great book wh a unexpected endg My dad read the 3 books  liked them I thk they are some of the best books wrten I read   one day but then aga I didn't sleep all day eher I hope that everyone enjoys this book as much
Many sties have striven to catch the mds of s readers  s listeners f that matter  From the begng of time people have made darg attempts at concoctg amusg  divertg tales but JK Rowlg has spun a most convcg sty  Sce the troduction of Harry Potter  to the public thouss upon thouss undoubtedly millions of every  race age  religion have fallen under his spell  After readg the  fourth Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire (Fished   less than three  days I couldn't put  down!) I have to let  be know that Ms Rowlg  does not disappot  As every precedg Potter book starts off the  newest is no dferent:  Harry is stayg wh his sufferable relatives  the Dursleys  And as always he has found a new me creative   excg means of shteng his summer stay wh his Aunt Uncle   cous  Trouble variably manages to fd Harry even at his seemgly  secure refuge  Ld Volde-- oh goodness excuse me!--  he-who-must-not-be-named is at his strongest  Harry is facg greater  risk than ever befe  This is Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts  he  is now fourteen years old  So along wh le-threateng suations  almost losg a best friend meetg new foes dealg wh old ones-  namely Profess Snape  Draco Malfoy  managg to get most of his  homewk done Potter must also deal wh the anguish  misery of beg a  teenager  Take  from me I'm seventeen years old  's hard f me  to believe that JK Rowlg hasn't just experienced the cruelty of peers   at the same time the excg prospects that come wh the whole  &quotBeg a Teen&quot package  Fearg that I might give too much  away I'll leave you wh this tidb:  You'll laugh you'll cry you'll  learn how to pronounce Hermione but most imptantly you'll want to read  me  become a better person because of 
this is such a good book!i read   3 days   is 734pages  i am just 9! i wish i was not done yet because  is sogood was really suprisg when somebody died i am not tellg who  case you have not read the book i read  too fast try not to read  too fast  you read  fast by accident that is okay but read  slow  sav   is a great book   is the best one  the so far now that you are done wh my review buy the book so YOU can wre a review  END
The first three books were really great I love all of them but I thk this one's my fave so far! In the Goblet of Fire you clearly see the characters maturg which is great because sce  takes so long f each  book to come out the readers are maturg too some of them at the same  rate I expect so readers have characters they can relate to The book is  much longer but Rowlg says 's defely not the longest Harry Potter  book she's gog to wre And  you've heard any of the early rums  about this book- igne them Rowlg meant the 4th book to be a turng  pot  the series where the mood starts to get a b me excg   at the same time me serious I would say that the other books can be read  by  read to 2nd graders- 2nd century-ers But this one I would move up  to 4th graders As usual there is a sense of mystery  the book  a  huge twist  plot at the climax On the side   case you haven't  heard the Warner Brother's movie based on &quotHarry Potter  the  Scer's Stone&quot is scheduled to come out  November 2001 The cast  will be all Brish  Rowlg has a say  the production (but she  trusts them to do a good job)
It's long 's pivotal  yes  lives up to every ch of the termable hype  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot brgs back Voldemt wh all his loathsome powers tact but Harry's learned some new tricks   he's gog to need all of them  The series takes a me mature turn   Book Four  isn't all fun  quiddch by a long shot any me  It  should be terestg to see how sty plays out  the three books still  to come  JK Rowlg must have wizard blood somewhere  her background  she has captured all our imagations wh a series of books that have  become stant  endurg classics sce the day of their publication  She's gog to have a hard time toppg this one but I have a sneakg  suspicion she'll do  once aga  aga  aga
HelloI don't really care f &quotfantasy&quot type books Yet I fd myself unable to put down this bookI've read the  rest of the books  each one mounts me tension I was very doubtful at  the series when my ltle sister was tryg to get me to read   (&quot's about WIZARDS! stop buggg me&quot) but once I started the  first book I was hooked  The reason I like  is because the way  is  wrten  the sty you feel like you are actually THERE at Hogwarts  as Harry Potter Books have never done that f meI put  down   I'm just like:  whoa  I'm at homeThis latest book is  a ltle darker than previous ones 's a lot longer too but all the  better me time to spend as Harry!  The endg is full of suspence   is spectacular  I was almost shakg wh excement as I read  The  auth leaves  hangg a ltle at the very end:  I can't wa f the  next one to come out!  This book was defatly wth my money (the ltle  of  I have)  The hours of enjoyment make  wth every penny
A wonderful book f (older) children  adults  This sty has a harsher darker edge to   although I will miss the childish charm of the previous three books  is great to see that our hero Harry is growg  up The Muggle relations issues  Hermoe's house-elf rights movement  gives us some deeper matters to consider  between Harry's adventures I  also enjoyed the expansion of Harry's wld to clude the other schools  students  nations Kudos aga to JK Rowlg f an excellent addion  to the Harry series  We can't wa f the next adventure!
This episode of Harry Potter was well wth the wa  Why does every press release thk of this as children's lerature? I am 55 years old  just as thrilled wh  these books as everyone else  so are all MY friends This last one  releases the dark fces to carry the next three It's the year's best  read
The Goblet of fire surpasses all previous Harry Potter adventures This seven-hundred page book is riddled wh excement hum  danger It is enjoyable  a b addictive I highly reccoment this excellent book
This book is the best yet  the biggest but im sure theres gonna be bigger  better you will love this book  is tight tight im usually not the reader type but this cought my attention thanks JK Rowlg make me  make me make me pleaseeee make me ok well byer bye now
In the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series (which I have enjoyed immensely!) Potter has aga travelled to the famed Hogwarths school of magic  But this is a new Potter  Rowlgs seems to be comftable wh  her bewchgly famous creation comftable enough to let us see me  through Potter's eyes  At 753 pages  is a whopper of a sty wh an  outstg climax  so many juicy leads that the next three books should  be a snap There is a greater sense of emotional depth danger surprise   conflict  this novel than ever befe  It is fun to wness Harry  Ron  Hermione growg up together meetg challenges  limations  wh the same trademark elan that has made them famous  so lovable  Rowlg is a master styteller  she has built a smashgly rivetg  sty from the scaffold of her previously three books My only regret is  the two days of my le that I cannot remember very clearly because I was  riveted to this book  While I am sad that I have fished I must wk on  other thgs!  Read   you will see what I mean
In her fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series auth JK Rowlg pens another h  I am sure that younger readers will be especially thrilled at the troduction of new characters as well as the secrets we  learn about many of our old faves This book is every b as  captivatg as the first three  I especially like the fact that Rowlg  did not just do a &quothum-drum&quot repeat of some of the events  the  first three books but cooked up an entirely dferent angle f this  sty  She even took one of the ma events of the first three books out   replaced  wh somethg very terestg---but you'll have to read  f yourself to fd out what  is!  This is an excellent family book  Adults  children alike will be entertaed by the imagative wld that  they are transpted to when they read---the magical wld that is of  Harry Potter
Wonderful book!  Lives up to the hype whout a problem  Sty le flows smoothly not a sgle one of the 734 pages was wasted  the development of the characters as they grow older was terric  Rowlg has a gt f  ptrayg children (even fictional wizards  wches)  a realistic  manner  Funny  touchg  Now I just have to wa another year f the  5th one!
This year Harry's adventure started on a dferent track He has a hrible nightmare only to be comfted by the thought that he would be away from the Dursley's  a few sht weeks That is sped up by a generous ve by the Weasley's to go wh them to the Quiddch Wld Cup After  spendg the rest of the summer wh the Weasley's the gang fally went  back to Hogwarts They arrive at school to fd out somethg has changed  this year They anxiously wa to fd out who the new Defense Agast the  Dark Arts teacher will be  what the BIG SURPRISE isI am a few  chapters from the fish  I have only owned  f a few sht days  The Goblet of Fire is too good to put down Although  you want to fd  out what happens f those who haven't got  yet I won't reveal anythg  meParents this is a GREAT book so don't pass  up but don't just  give to your kids to read You can read  too I guarantee you'll love 
JK Rowlg has done  aga  This a cleverly wrten addion to the Harry Potter series   Harry has a &quotknack f attractg a lot of trouble&quot  also has the abily of  imagative creativy to wk  his way through a maze of traps  The theme is conflict between good   evil Beautully wrten  Harry's ment a powerful good wizard of his  time prepares Harry f outwtg monsters  this dramatic scary  adventure  &quotIt matters not what someone is bn but what they grow to  be&quot  There is a timeless mal message here  Good does triumph over  evil  Intrigug f both children  Adults
I eagerly awaed this fourth book  because JK Rowlg can really tell a sty well I was not disappoted That is a feat  self given all the hype  expectations surroundg this book I personally miss  Harry playg Quiddch  's gettg a ltle cumbersome to try   catch readers up that haven't read the first three books but these thgs  certaly don't detract from the book There isn't much else I can say  whout givg away the sty but  this readers's opion (a 43 yr old  adult) please igne the hype  hoopla surroundg this book just read    enjoy the amazg magical sty
There was simply too much hype surroundg this book to allow my expectations to be met which were not high to start wh It's funny how much of somethg people will buy wh the suggestion of the media
Which was better than the 2nd Which was better than the 1st Be warned  is darker  sadder but great I was really hard to put  down as wh the other books  the series! It is defely the most  imptant book  the series so far- but I better not say any me  case  I give somethg away!
My sister  I agree that the Harry Potter series keeps gettg better as the series progresses  The fourth book is very good  fast paced yet aga one that you just can't put down  The fourth book is a ltle me  serious  scary but considerg that the ma villian  the series  Voldemt is evil  supposed to be buildg his strength aga f the  climactic seventh book  should be expected to get a ltle me serious  Though the fourth book isn't que as light-hearted as the first three  books there are still plenty of funny scenes volvg the many  dficulties of beg a teenager  school  The fourth Harry Potter book  keeps your attention from the suspenseful first chapter to the suprisg  end  As Harry matures so does the plot le of the series  JK  Rowlg's wrg  The only thg I have the compla about is that the  fourth book was so good wag another year f the next book is gog to  be hard
Go Harry Potter! Like the other three Harry Potter books from the series this is mysterious  thrillg! Very funny deed  of course MAGICAL! This is the best book yet! Unlike the other books 's deeper   darker Interestg don't you thk?I recommend this book to  everyone! Grown ups too Who cares  you're 99 years!  Read !
This book was absolutly credible Rowlg gives amazg discriptions of everythg makg you not want to put the book down! It( like all the other Harry Potter books)is like a movie When you read the wds you  can just picture what is gog on the bookIt really has you wishg you  were a wizard! I would strongly recommend this book  all the others to  readers of all agesEventhough the book is 734 pages long  will be  havg you wish  mas much much me!
This is the best book of all the series  Durg the triwizard events i was on the edge of my seat  This is the first book I've ever gotten so to  I stayed up till three  the mng just to read   It is well  wth your while to stop  read this great book which is sure to be a  fave f years to come
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is another wonderful addion to the series Don't let the me than 700 pages scare you The sty was so well wrten that  was hard to put the book down The only downside to this book is that there seems to be an unusually high number of gruesome deaths  This may be OK f older children  adults but may be far to graphic  f younger readers I would urge parents to use discretion Another well  wrten book by JK Rowlg
This fourth stallment holds the same page-turng attention of s three predecesss This is the kd of book that makes a fast reader lament Each page has s surprises  holds the reader  suspense--but  is  one page closer to the end And the end of the book means another long wa  f the next stallment JK Rowlg is as ventive as ever   graciously gives us a longer book to enjoy It was well wth the wa Let  the wag f book 5 beg!
FACINATING! OUTSTANING! Harry Potter is  danger me than ever!  He just can't seddle down wh all of the rumms! How is he gog to have enough time f homwk!  He's on his toes asll the time! Is he gog to  have Ron &amp Hermoe help him  is he gog to do  on his own? Are  the Dursley's gog to lay off him  is he gog to have a miserable  summer!  Harry is tryg to prove somthg But what? He needs help from  his godfather How is he gog to get that help? He might need  sooner  thatn he thks  later than that
After hearg the news that Harry Potter 4 weighed  at an unbelievable 750 pages I hope you can fgive me f thkg that perhaps just perhaps JK Rowlg could have used an ed  &quotWhat was she  thkg&quot I found myself askg as I hefted the bookWell I've  lost two night's sleep completg the thg because I could barely brg  myself to put  down  She needed every one of those pages to tell a  grippg sty that I aded  If anythg this book is better than the  first three:  richer darker cleverer I would quibble somewhat wh the  &quotJames Bond villa disease&quot that seems to pervade the evildoers   these books (&quothere befe I kill you let me expla my nefarious  plot&quot) but Rowlg manages to tie together somethg like 5  6  distct plot les  an explosive conclusion while only restg to this  device essentially onceI love the fact that Harry Ron  Hermione  are growg up  There are several tender  awkward moments as they come  to terms wh the fact that Hermione is a girl -- somethg that was never  imptant befe except  the context of who was allowed  which  bathroomIt is amusg to see several characters providg  exaggerated  phonetic pronounciation hts to &quotHermione&quot -- I wonder  this  is the most common question Rowlg gets from the American audience?
After book 3 I was hopg that the next  the Harry Potter series would re-vigate the series While &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot was a good book  seemed that there was a defe fmula developg that was  makg Harry's adventures less excg Well I'm happy to say that  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot lived up to my  expectations! Even the book cover lets you know that JK Rowlg is gog  to shake thgs up at the Hogwarts School f Wchcraft  Wizardry I  won't reveal too many details but  this one Harry faces his biggest  challenge(s) yet! While the book is not overtly scary I guess parents  should be warned that  is so far at least the darkest of the series -   Harry is fced to face some pretty grim suations  upsettg  consequences But I don't thk 's anythg a kid couldn't hle  especially sce the lessons Harry learns are ones that we all must face  sooner  later As wh the rest of the series I would highly reccomend  that parents read this book out loud to their children Harry's adventures  are one of those  rare feats that truly can volve all age groups equally  And as someone who very fondly remembers the nights when my father used to  read to my sisters  I I can assure you that this is exactly the st of  thg that we would have loved to have shared
I am a twelve-year-old homeschooled girl I have just fished readg JK Rowlg's latest book &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot I enjoyed  very much Rowlg has a wonderful way of mixg excellent wrg talent hum action adventure  a great plot to  make a superb book I am glad that she took her time wrg the book  therefe matag the qualy of the wrg  of the sty self  There are many auths who try too hard to get sequels out as soon as  possible that they reduce the qualy of the sty as well as the  wrg Rowlg has really out done herself this time I would highly  recomend this book f someone who loves fantasy  adventure as much as I  do
As I turned around searchg my room f an evil wizard I realized that I was at home   was only my shadow lurkg  the depths of my room I turned back to the book  began to read the enchantg  bewchg novel Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire The fourth book  the series  of seven by JK Rowlg is just as rivetg as the first three  not  me  Each of the books  this series is about each year of Harry's le  at his school Hogwarts School of Whcraft  Wizardry As most of my  friends  I agree this book is enchantg This 734 page book is  defely a page turner It supplies you wh a great deal of magical yet  dangerous creatures evil wizards great friends dangerous le  threateng  tasks  an abundant amount of wonderful wrg This book  f all age groups thrills chills  exces s readers through  Harry's fourth year  Luckily f me there were no wizards lurkg around  my house Unftunately f Harry Voldemt  the Death- eaters are at  their dark wk aga
The fourth book  this series wks as well as any of the others have  Providg the usuall trigue  adventure  This is  fact exactly what drops my ratg of this book  I can't honestly say that i have ever  disliked readg one of Rowlg's wks but to me they seem to have a deep  seated pattern about them  I thk that she tried to break thgs up a b  wh a few clever plot twists (won't mention them here you'll have to read  f yourself) however many times i knew exactly what was gog to happen   the sty  Other then what i mentioned no big complats  And i guess  the predictabily couldn't be avoided really sce  would be hard to  break up the nmal route of Harry's school year much whout completly  rug the contuy of the sty  I'm sure that as Harry grows up the  books will beg to do like wise becomg less predictable as well  Speakg of which the books have a certa trend to grow exponentialy  From 309 to 341 to 439 to 743 pages from each book to the next  I'm hopg  that book five doesn't reach to the thouss  Anyway keep up the good  wk Rowlg you really have a knack f creatg an imersive believable  fantasy wld
I really didn't thk she could make another book as good as the other three but she did  aga at 700 some pages long It really was very good
This book is so COOL!  I refused to read this series when my ltle brother first got them but once when I was REALLY at a lack of books I took up book one   was GrEAT! thank whoever is up there that he had also  gotten all the OTHER books!  Well this book came out  immidiately I  stole  from him aga   was OUTRAGEOUS!  YOu HAVE to get this book!   you HAVE to read all the others first though  You'll be kickg yourself   you dont!  well It was cool AND long!  GET THIS BOOK
i love these books they're one of the few books that have actually pulled me to the book so that s like i can see whats gog onlike i'm actually feelg what the characters are feelg s great to see these  characters grow  change! okay AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN SEE THAT RON  AND HERMONIE LIKE EACH OTHER! nobody else has said anythg about that!  i  thk that would be so cute!  anyways this book didnt have to be as long  as they made  i mean she could have cut a lot of  out but hey  was  still really good!
This is defetly the best yet! J K Rowlg is a geus! The sty is good the characters are funny the plot is excgI wish I could give  six stars!
The Harry Potter series is one of the most imagative book series I've read wh the possible exception of The Hchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series It has lots of those tidbs that everybody loves- the first   third demonstrated this well  to a lesser extent so did the second  But maybe there is such thg as too much of a good thg- this book is  swarmg wh them   shows as the book is a whoppg 753 pages-  ltle kids will have trouble ltg  let alone read  I don't md  the size so much as the focus- Harry Potter once aga domates the  spotlight The sty should focus less on Harry  me on the friends  Even Harry's friends compla about this problem Maybe the next book  should be Hermione Ron  Neville  the Stolen Publicy But overall  the book is very good  will quench the thirst of Harry fans
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was absolutely thrillg! The plot kept you guessg until the very end! This book was defately me scary than the first three But  made  even me fun to read The book brgs  many new faces  creatures to the sty All of whom are que  terestg You may actually fd yourself a b stunned by what happened  near the end I gave this book 5 stars - It deserved 500!
This book was the best one so far out of the four  It was the most terestg  by far the best wrten  I especially liked how there were several dferent plots that all came together  the end  If you liked the other books you should read this one too
This long-awaed book was snatched up by kids  parents all around the country  Some of you may thk the excement was a ltle overrated  You won't  you read the book  This book was as good as the first ones   not better  Although the book is a ltle deeper  darker than the other  ones  is still just as light  airy as ever but the auth uses some  of the extra pages (nearly 300 me than the third one) to exple the  characters personales better  We get to know them better  we also  have some new characters troduced to us  We learn me about  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemt)  his reign of terr  The book  never lags  terest as we watch the characters progressHarry  wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys  go to the International  Quiddch Cup wh Hermione Ron  the Weasleys  He wants to dream  about Cho Chang his crush ( maybe do me than dream)  He wants to  fd out about the mysterious event that's supposed to take place at  Hogwarts this year an event volvg two other rival schools of magic   a competion that hasn't happened f a hundred years  He wants to be a  nmal fourteen-year-old wizard  Unftunately f Harry Potter he's not  nmal--even by wizardg stards  And  this case dferent can be  deadlyFrom the mysterious begng to the fast-paced middle to the  hangg end this book is every b as good  has as many twists   revelations as the first three  In fact  only leaves you wantg one  thg:  the fth one right at h to start the second you fish this  one
Wh hours of obtag this book I had read  cover to coverHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the much-hyped fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series It is also the longest of the books to date the  American hardcover comg to about 750 pages This isn't the only  dference though sce Harry has grown up  wh him the  seriesWhere one  two were light-hearted funny  energetic  Prisoner of Azkaban (Book 3) was called the darkest of the books Well I  don't thk that GoF is as dark as PoA but  is much bloodier  mature  Death is far me rampant  s pages than  any of the previous  volumesOf course this does not mean that GoF is any wse than the  first three Personally I liked  better Despe s length  seemed  less complete than 1 - 3  set up the sty f what the remag books  will probably be dealg wh It was a lot like Star Wars: the Empire  Strikes Back  that  set up only half of the full sty (Of course  most Star Wars fans will tell you ESB was the best of the movies) This   no way detracts from the stytellg It just hs you wh the  realization that the next book is many months awayI don't mean to make   sound as  this is a hrible gruesome book Yes  is me  pessimistic than the others but  has s fair share of hum  fun    is overall optimistic  tone It was evable that Harry grow up  but his dog so requires that we grow up wh himDon't be afraid go  get this book as soon as you can Rowlg has not disappoted fans wh  GoFJust remember that nocence can't last fever least of all f  the boy whose greatest enemy is the dreaded &quotYou-Know-Who&quot
All devoted Harry Potter fans will certaly not be disappoted by The Goblet of Fire!  Though many believed that all of the hype about this novel was unfounded  is defely a wonderful extremely well-wrten novel full of excg twists  turns character developments  subplots  Great characters suspense  action are a few of Rowlg's many  hallmarks  Book 4 contas all that  much much me  The length  makes  great f beach-readg  also creases the suspense fact as  there are clfhangers at many of the chapter endgs  As f the plot   is as fabulous as ever wh events that as  the previous 3 books build  up to a thrillg climax  fish  Readers of all ages--this is a  must-have!
I just fished this book  's amazg Harry has someterestg adventures wh Voldemt  (I really was scared aboutthe part durg) the triwizard tourny I couldn't put this book down  was so good I fished   2 days A very good book  an awesome read f all ages Even adults  small children!
WOW! I am currently up to page 605  the book  I just can't put  down! How I managed to tear myself away from  I DON'T KNOW! The Goblet of Fire has  all! I suggest that anyone who is a fan of the series GO OUT  AND BUY IT! Even  your not a fanBUY IT! There is just too many  spectacular thgs  the 4th stallment of the Harry Potter series f me  to wre downfrom the Quiddich Wld Cup to the Triwizard Tournament to  all the 3 tasks to the new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher to all the  many new  old characters you meet! ITS BRILLIANT! Howeverfrom what  I've heardthere is a casualty  the bookwhom I don't know as of yet  but I am dreadg the part  which I fd out! But at the same time I  don't want to put the book down! OY! GET THIS BOOK! You WON'T be  disappoted
I am an 18 year old post A-Level English Lerature student who is not ashamed to say 'I love Harry Potter'  have read all four of the Harry Potter books so far I am amazed at the strength these particular childrens  books have  was caught clamberg f a copy of the latest one knockg  ltle children out of the way  the process Harry as a character really  emerges from the pages  this latest book  I could not stop readg  this book until I had fished   This book wks on all sts of levels  despe some of the reviews I have read  after troducg one of my  friends to the wld of Harry Potter she too was amazed at the amount of  depth J K Rowlg has weaved to each page (She is actually gog to  study English Lerature at Cambridge next year which really shows how  brilliant a creation Harry Potter is)  I wish books had been this well  wrten when i was 11 All I really have to say is 'When is the next one  out?'
The fourth book of the Harry Potter series makes  clear why the remag books are necessary  Me than any of the others  the series _Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_ sets the framewk f the series' plot  puts the developments of the other three books to  perspectiveBesides all that the book is great  J K Rowlg's style  seems me confident than ever  the 700+ pages are just an answer to  &quotI wish  didn't end so soon!&quot  Despe s length the sty  doesn't drag  this is especially because  elabates so neatly on  some of the less conspicuous details  the precedg books  Suddenly  house elves (remember Dobby?) take on a huge imptance  Scabbers gets  even me sister   the sty of Tom Riddle haunts Harry once aga  Plus we even get some hts to the basis f Voldemt's maniacal  tendencies (feriy complex due to paternal neglect?  Yearng f  unreturned parental love?  Who knows!)  Rowlg has clearly thought this  series out  Book Four builds seamlessly on everythg she's told us  previously  Rather than gettg bed of the whole Harry Potter craze you  beg to see why seven books are really needed --  fact wh Voldemt's  return to power  this volume you wonder how the rest of the sty could  possibly f to the remag three booksI suppose the only  complats I have about this book are that the love angle is somewhat  clunky  s treatment  that at the end of the book you do wonder  why the sidious sider at Hogwarts had to go to _all_ that efft just  to get Harry  But hey  The descriptions of Ra Skeeter the overzealous  news repter who can turn an &quotEr&quot to a confession of one's  nermost ( least-existg) secrets are hilarious  The scenes that  feature Voldemt are truly scary  Harry Potter's path f the next three  years is much me clearly defed now  And the length was perfect f me  :)
Harry Potter has once aga managed to foil my best laid plans to read his sty slowly  sav each chapter From the very start I found myself sucked to the Quiddch wld Cup the hts of You-Know-Who's ement return  the red-herrgs as to who was on which side  Those that  claim that the book is darker need to look at the facts as they st:  Harry's parents are dead Many wizards did not survive Voldemt's first  reign There are plenty who would be happy to see the dark days return  None of those is a bright happy thg The pot is that JK Rowlg has  given us a character that uses his abilies  mals f good not evil  despe the &quotdarkness&quot around him Overall the 4th book takes  Harry ( the reader) on a me tense emotional roller coaster complete  wh thrills  chills I f one cannot wa until the next tra leaves  the station!
I really loved this book  If you have ready the other Harry Potter books you will love this one too  In this book Harry Potter is havg fun  is sneakg around agian  He goes all over the place  Hogwarts  event goes to a Quiddicth Profeational game  The Triwizard tournament is stared  agian (this tournament can be deadly)  someone put harry's name  the  goblet of fire to get him killed  It was one of You-Know-Who's servents  But I'm not tellg who  could be Snape  someone new just read  f  you self  Harry even meets Ld Voldmt aga  he is back but I am  not gog to tell you how  I will ru  f you because I know how  much you will enjoy this when you read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  you won't be able to put  down
Hello  I am a 17 yr old female  I have read all 4 Harry Potter books  I have to say Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire is by far (so far) the best  this series  The book's fantastic auth JK Rowlg  creates an awesome atmosphere  She takes you side the md of Potter   his 4rh year at Hogwarts  you feel all the  anticipation relief  sadness(  yes I cried)  all other feelgs as the summer  year  progress This well wrten Novel unfolds wh many twists surprises   (surprisgly) even some problems children will face  real le  Yet   is not a book solely f children  My father has also read all four   we both eagerly awa the arrival of the 5th book  the Uned States!
Wh each new book I keep thkg to myself &quot just can't get any better&quot  they do!  They become me engrossg  mesmerisg  you keep wantg to know me  me about Harry Potter  his gang of  friendsI believe the true strength of this series is  how well JK  Rowlg is agg her characters  We started seeg them at age 11  now  they are age 14  wh each book you feel that they are another year  older  you can see their newfound maturaty  securies comg out  of them   is just masterful  So often  series what gets dull is  that the ma character NEVER changes but here you are watchg Harry  grow up  you truly feel like you are right there wh himThe other  strength of these books is that they aren't made up of cookie cutter plots  each time you thk you know who the bad guy is  how Harry  his  friends will face the dangers  you end up shocked at how wrong you were  about everythgAfter I closed the back cover I couldn't help but  thkg &quotwhat a shame  is that there will be only 3 me books   this series&quot JK Rowlg has once aga cast her spell over me  you  can bet that when book 5 gets released FedEx will once aga be makg  that special delivery to my dostep the day of the releaseIf you  haven't already started wh these books regardless of who you are you  will love them  This book is loved by all young  old because the  messages that come through them are ageless  Buy them all  cherish this  treasure  If you haven't read this one buy  I promise you'll only be  left wantg f meThank you JK Rowlg f givg the wld this  gt
The latest  the Harry Potter saga is as JK Rowlg told us darker than s predecesss but 's still the best read  town ( I'm 26!)  I won't go to the plot too much sce I hate  when people spoil books  f those who haven't read them yet  But I must say that the reason I love  this series so much is that while the wld that Harry  his friends  hab is magical the people are REAL  The reason that this book is  scarier sadder  me complicated is because the characters are growg  older  that's what happens when you grow older:  you realize how much  me complicated le gets  how when  comes to a person's character  there are an awful lot of shades of grey rather than just black  whe  Nothg  no one is as clear-cut as  first appeared  never will be  aga
Harry Potter - the 4th book  the series keeps gog along at a breakneck pace At times I had to remd myself that I should not read ahead but I couldnt help  Once this book has you  dosent let go This was such a  page turner I found myself readg almost till dawn a couple of times I  cant wa f the next one to come outas they say the plot thickens !  Highly recommended !
Wow!  This book really was - as a lot of review tles state - the best out of all of 'em  When I found out that  had seven hudred odd pages I was like &quotGood This should keep me busy f a while&quot WRONG!  I fished   two days -  had me hooked  What was the term that  they used  the book description f this? &quotPivotal&quot   somethg?  This is what I terpeted that as: that f one the books  would be &quotpivotg&quot  their themes  You know like the first  three books were - f the most part  until they reached the end -  lighthearted wh a  ht of the &quotdark side&quot poppg up every now   then  But now that Voldemt's back thgs are gog to be gettg  darker  darker  darker  Rowlg was defly right when she warned that this  book would be a lot darker than the others  Which brgs up another  pot  Is Rowlg really sure that she wres f children?  I mean you  have all of this &quotdark side&quot stuff gog on which is enough to  terrize most ltle kids  And all of the rememberg that you have to do  - you have to be able to remeber stuff from previous books  from the  begng of the book etc etcOverall &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire&quot was a great book  I'd reccomend  to anyone - Harry Potter fan   not
I thought this was a good follow-up to the previous Harry Potter books  However  took a lot longer to get to the book  I mean Harry doesn't get back to Hogwarts until about pg 150!  The last 200 pages though were  well wth the wa  I really enjoyed the tournament self  enjoyed  all the twists  turns that occur at the end  The Mistry polics were  also an terestg aspect of this book  It is terestg to see that top  Mistry officials  Hogwarts staff do not agree on many issues  This  book also dealt wh some of the darker aspects of the series  had some  moments that will be scary f young children  Parents might want to read  the book themselves first  decided what chapters  parts their children  should read  The auth's style remds me a lot of Roald Dahl  his  excellent children's books cludg: Charlie  the Chocolate Facty  Matilda  the BIG  I recommend this  the other Potter books to all  those terested  fantasy  fiction  If you like the Potter books you  might like auths like Lloyd Alexer  Dahl
I was wried that the fourth book wouldn't be up to her previous excellent wrg  But I was delighted wh this book  I had to wa f my son to fish  (he did  2 days) then I read   I loved the  entire book  certaly left room f the remag 3 books  I tried to  slow down my readg to sav every wd as I know  will be a while  befe the fth book comes out  But I just couldn't I was whizzg  though the pages actually wh Harry everywhere he went  I didn't even  realize I was readg!  I am gog to have to start  over aga  It is  really imptant to read these books  sequence  A lot of the cleverness  might be missed  you didn't get to know the characters from the  begng  I absolutely loved this book  am eagerly wag f the  next
This is just great! All fans of Harry Potter will be impressed wh this astoundg book I was amazed when I saw how long  is (733 pages)   packed wh adventure suspense  me background fmation on the  characters So to read me about Harry's adventures  fd out me  surprisg facts about Snape Hagrid Dobby  even Neville buy this  book ~ you won't be disappoted!
Welcome to the wonderful wld of Harry Potter where elves drop desserts  hats sg where games are  the air  Harry is havg the time of his le  And  the fourth novel  this series the fun ceases not  Expect many wty characters an ultimately untraceable plotle  the  biggest surprise ever Wonderfully wrten  thought out by the  comprable JK Rowlg you'll fd that purchasg this book is well  wth the extremely low price amazoncom asks
JK Rowlg has outdone herself this time  The 4th edion of the Harry Potter series is the greatest one yet  I began readg  as soon as I got  on Saturday mng  fished  the next mng  Even though this  book is darker  much me frighteng then the others  the series   leads the way f the next three novels  Everyone should read this book
Don't be put off by this book's length!  The newest Harry Potter book is fantastic altough s plot rema similar to the last three stallments  The first chapter while dark  menacg is excellent  The followg  100 pages however are rather dull  may leave the reader regrettg  their purchase  Thankfully the plot picks up quickly  soon you can't  put  down  New addions like the Yule Ball  the Triwizard  Tournament keep thgs terestg but I couldn't help noticg how alike  the outles of the series' books are  The pattern f every plot goes  like this: Harry gets rescued from his uncle's house by Ron Harry goes to  Hogwarts Harry meets new Dark Arts teacher Harry fights  climax Harry  discovers DA teacher's mysterious secret Harry goes home  This isn't  nessecarily a bad thg but  could get tiresome by the next book  Nevertheless  you liked the last books  haven't read any of them you  won't want to miss this  JK Rowlg's references to everyday le such  as her thoughts agast racism  the troubles of the po add to the  style  Anyone who takes the time to read through s 750-plus pages  will fd themselves satisfied ( surprised!) upon fishg   And a  fal wd: If you haven't read the last three books don't start wh this  one  It gives away all of those books' best secrets
This book was a compelg sty of a young boy who faces many challenges not only of adolesence but of the wizardg wld Harry Potter has aga come back  this fourth novel to be challenged by Voldemt  his arch enemy Draco Malfoy This book even though long was one of the greater  books  the series so far  The plot was treagg  the sty le  was carried very well through out the sty  I give this amazg book 5  stars because  is amazg how mystygly gr  is
I was totally dismayed by this credibly bg book  Maybe my expectations had been high but the sty is just senseless  tedious  The so-called creativy bderles on absurdy  sany   children will not benef from this book
This is by far the best of the series so far  The wrg is magnicent almost lyrical I was pleased to see all our fave characters return  delighted to ga new sight to several of them  The histy of several characters is expled a b me  this wonderful  addion to the Harry Potter series And special thanks to Ms Rowlg f  fally teachg us po Americans how to pronounce &quotHermione&quot I  would caution parents that this is not f the youngest readers While  still retag Ms Rowlg's blend of drama  hum Goblet of Fire is  no light-hearted romp It is much me tense than the previous novels   liable to send your children to you wh questions As has been  repted there is a death  this book    s consequences are  seriously addressed Still this is one of the best books I've read   que some time  I strongly recommend  If only there'd been Harry  Potter  MY childhood Sigh
All I have to say is that this book is not as good as the first 3 books but  is still good  s own way The wst part of this book is the endg because you dont know when the next book will be out
I read this book  4 days  Yes all 7hundred  some odd pages  I loved   I was so totally deprived of any Harry Potter to liven up my wld that I just sat down  read the whole thg so when can I get the next one?
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was an amazg book that was Much longer than the previous ones   makes that ltle spot  the back of your throat that fills up wh joy  sadness nearly burst I was stg  there readg  look like a fool cause i was very exced but  so  soooo goodthe endg was  greatI can't wa f the fh one so read   you! well thats about all one can say really s good s kd of dark  some places s excellent el f
The Harry Potter books are turng out to be a st of a milestone  children's books  They're &quotwonderful&quot &quotgreat&quot  &quotbeautul&quot  I agree wh this st of description however   is imptant to pot that this series of books is an epome  therefe  a generic example of any novel about magicHow is  generic    seems so igal?JK Rowlg is a master at combg what every good  book needs: the old war between the good  evil lots of magic tricks   a likeable ma character (f we cannot not like Harry because he's an  phan right?)The books conta all the gredients any book about a  school of magic should have: magical creatures wise  evil wizards  strange spells  weird professs  On the other h  is not  dficult to fd these  other books f children  Yet the fame of Harry  Potter lives on - is  because we have fgotten to venture to the l  of books  we only pick what is most popular?  Nobody seems to remember  Roal Dahl  JRR Tolkien - the Harry Potter books are much easier to  obta (especially wh all the discounts on them)Ok  I don't want to  seem that I am agast the Harry Potter books - they are pretty   well-wrten  It is nice to see ltle six-year-olds carryg the giant  seven hundred page long books wh themBut Harry Potter books is not  all there is - try somethg else f a change people away wh the cult  of Harry Potter :)As f the book number fourThe Goblet of Fire is  well wrten although  seems a b rushed  It is almost as  JK  Rowlg meant to wre  as a longer book  had to stop herself to make   f somethgAlso  is much easier to expect who the guilty party  is gog to be  The previous books would have three kds of suspects:  a  the obviously guilty ones b the obviously nocent  c characters who  were not suspects at allIn the previous books  was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty  Book #4 seems to be  a slip f  does not hold us on the same lever of excement f we  easily predict who is tryg to kill Harry Potter this time (simply by  choosg b not c)Overall I give the book 4 stars not 5  This book  does not st as high as the previous ones yet I still highly recommend  previous books  was the characters  who were beyond suspicion who turned out to be guilty  Book #4 seems to be  a slip f  does not hold us on the same lever of excement f we  easily predict who is tryg to kill Harry Potter this time (simply by  choosg b not c)Overall I give the book 4 stars not 5  This book  does not st as high as the previous ones yet I still highly recommend  
I am not  the least b ashamed to adm that I read Harry Potter About a year ago I fished readg JRR Tolke's  celebrated &quotLd of the Rgs&quot trilogy When I put  down I  remember thkg &quotNever aga will such a masterpiece of fantasy be  wrten&quot But JK Rowlg has sce proven me wrong In her first  three books she captured all the aspects of great fantasy: the wonderful  wld of wchcraft  wizardry the strange  magical creatures the  dark  fbiddg evil wizards  their jovial  somewhat humous  counterparts In her brilliance Rowlg wrapped all of this around thgs  kids everywhere can relate to namely school spts  just growg up  This fourth book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is no exception  There is however no Hogwarts Quiddch Cup It has been replaced (f one  year) by the Triwizard Tournament an International competion of histic  proptions The fal chapter ironically called &quotThe Begng&quot  will leave readers tappg their feet  anticipation of book five
Although usually the wd &quotsequel&quot prepares you to lower your expectations this fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series packs even me excement quirky characters  tightly plotted events than the  previous three books  Much attention has been paid to s length (734  pages  four pounds) but  is a supremely satisfyg read  You will  want to sav every page  Although most of the maj plot elements of this  volume are resolved by the end the auth hts at some of the challenges  which lie ahead f our hero pavg the way f me excement  volume  five  Film cric Roger Ebert wres that the reason the &quotStar  Wars&quot series is so successful is that s creat Gege Lucas pays  careful attention to even the mutest detail populatg even the cners  of the frame wh terestg characters  In much the same way J K  Rowlg packs the Harry Potter books wh so much detail that the wld of  wches  wizards comes alive  In &quotGoblet of Fire&quot this  enchantg wld is revealed  greater scope wh me of the action  takg place  the wider wld outside the Hogwarts School  We learn f  the first time of the existence of other schools of wizardry  we meet  characters from other cultures  Although so many thgs about the  wizardg wld are dferent at the same time we can really identy wh  the thoughts  feelgs of these characters:  the awkwardness of  adolescence the loneless of an phaned boy  the excement of first  love  Rowlg has wrten a book to delight Harry Potter fans everywhere  My question is how long until she produces volume 5?
The fourth book of Harry Potter is so exhilaratg!  The book looks very long but  whizzes by so fast!  You won't be able to put  down!  Some of the ma events such as the Triwizard Tournament are so cool you'll  want to read those chapters aga  aga!  In this book you'll see the  same characters from the other books cludg Harry's friends Ron  Hermione  his rival Draco Malfoy  You'll also meet some new characters  as well  You'll feel as  you're by Harry's side the whole time!  Rowlg  has done  once aga  I suggest this book to every thg  the wld  cludg Muggles  Mrakes
Absolutely her best yet! JK Rawlg another great job  The length of the book made  even better f from begg to end the excement never let down   was nice knowg there was so much me left to read  Mrs Rawlg keep up the good wk  Can not wa to fd out what adventures  Harry will get himself to next
This book totally blew me away!  F once somethg came outthat was wth all the hype about  I have really enjoyed the HarryPotter series previously as have my husb  sons  I expected to enjoy this book  I did not expect to be enraptured by a book that made me laugh cry do both at the same time be my nails scream  hr  smile wh delight  I am so glad I was mistaken When I realized how long this book is (750+ pages) I was sure that there were gog to be some slow moments  NOT TRUE!  This book starts off runng  keeps you enthralled until you reach the last page beggg f me  I would defely recommend that anyone who wants to read this start wh Book 1  read the Harry Potter books  der I am also unsure  the younger children who have enjoyed the series up until now will appreciate the darker turns  Goblet of Fire  If you are a parent of a child from age 7-10 who is a Harry Potter fan make sure you discuss the me frighteng aspects of the book wh you child  I can't say enough good thgs about this book but I don't want to give any of the surprises away  Let's just say there are lots of surprises some of them frighteng  some of them hilarious  JK Rowlg has a way of terjectg hum  even the most tense of scenes I really also enjoyed seeg the return of a number of characters whom I thought would not show up aga Read this book  You won't regret 
This is my fave Harry Potter book to date  There is greater character development  many of the plot les started  earlier books are at last explaed  Warng: It is a b darker than the previous books
I received my book at 11 am on 7/8I fished  at 1 am on Sunday  This book IS darker than the first three but I found myself laughg out loud several times  on the verge of tears at others  I loved the new  characters  enjoyed gettg back wh my old friends  Once aga JK  Rowlg kept me on the edge of my seat wh her easy to read style   great sense of mystery  adventure  Now I will fd  hard to wa f  Volume V!
This Harry Potter books was beyond excellent!   was better then all the others- I was nervous this one wasn't gog to be as good- but  turned out to be better than the prisoner of Azkaban! I LOVED IT! It was full of  excement- yet  didn't get out of h I would reccomend this to  anyone! please read !
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is another astoundg success!  The characters contue to blossom  as the plot twists  twists aga New aspects of the overall 7 book series come to view  Thgs occurg  the past are revealed to add me pieces to the puzzle of Harry Potter I  could not put this book down
The first time I read a Harry Potter book I was sucked   I couldn't stop  And now I've fished Harry Potter  the Goblet Of Fire  Most people say that they believe JK Rowlg's books would only get better  they were right  The Goblet Of Fire is an amazg adventure from  beggng to end  It tells the tale of the mysterious Triwizard  tournament  which two other schools compete agast Hogwarts f the  ultimate gly  Also  describes how evil is risg from the old Riddle  house  Harry Potter And The Goblet of Fire is much me than a wthy  purchase  This is an adventure you just can't put down!
This letter goes out to all the HP lovers out there:  I just fished the fourth Harry Potter book (Goblet of Fire)  let me just tell you how utterly amazg this book is  I heard is was good but I never even  expected beyong my wildest dreams that someone could wre such an  outstg masterpiece  This set of books will deed be tled as  classics f the next generation  My kids will be readg them there  kids  so on the only dissapotment I do have f this book is that  I have to now wa a year f book number five to come out!

The fourth Harry Potter book defely lived up to all the hoopla  It starts wh a dream that Harry is havg  is  really happeng?  I would defely recommend this book to anyone  All  all this book has  everythg: excement adventure death friendship  (obviously) a  ltle magic
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  outstg book I did not read the first until later  s publication but I could not wa f the second third  fourth However long the wa f Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire was  has proven to be wth-while The fourth Harry  Potter book does not let down readers but only encourages them to further  volve themselves  the plot F a teenage reader such as myself the  way JK Rowlg addresses Harry's agg is a truthful  overwhelmgly  accurate account Harry is nothg me than a nervous teenage boy when he  needs to ask Cho to the dance simply showg aga that Harry is only  human when  comes to some matters Harry Potter  his fourth adventure  manages to captivate readers to wantg nothg me than to read me   me tales of this boy's le I loved the sty spun  Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire  poured though the 734 page book  several  hours  Harry Potter is a universal sty  which a boy lives His le  may be far from what we know as dary but a le which I f one  would love to experience
This book starts out rather slowly  Get through the first third  beyond befe you give up on   That's because she has so many new characters  events to brg to play to carry her through the rest of  the book  to the next!  It's a terric read wh a long-fbidden  tournament brought back f the first time  years  many surprises  You will see many old friends  new faces  this book  It doesn't end  que as happily as some  that's all I'm gog to say  Please do read  this book!
This is the kd of book you stay up all night readg - which is exactly what I did  The wonderful thg about Rowlg is that she knows how to grip her readers  keep them beggg f me  I don't want to ru the endg  all the surprises hidden  the book but let's just say that  Voldemt is at  aga! It's dficult to watch Harry whom we all love  so much get to so many le-threateng suations  Don't miss this book  my opion the  best yet  the series!
Unbelieavable!  I read this  a 48 hour span  I could hardly put  down escpecially when I got  the last 200 pages  JK Rowlg really knows how to make her characters come to le  have us all feel real attachments to them  Thank you JK f wrg a series of books that  takes us away from everythg gog on  our own lives f just a while
Harry Potter years 1-3 have been great books but I thk year 4 is the best so far It is a book you just want to keep readg  never put down It was mysterious scary  amazgly wonderful! All the characters are great  I love Quiddch is awesome! I just can't wa till the next  book I bet  will be even better!
No slackg off here  All that we expected  lots of new styles  Doesn't really st alone well but who wants to read just this one anyway  Very satisfied
Rowlg topped the charts wh her first three books  now shes at  aga!  Wh an all new book contag a Quiddch wld cup a Triwizard Tournament a Yule Dance wh a certa girl  a whole lot of fun
JK Rowlg did a credibly great job on this book  All of Rowlg's books are great but I do have to say that this is defatly her best one yet  It has everthg that have made the previous books good such as  Harry's friends Quidch Sirus Black  of course Harry but this new  book has me! The Goblet of Fire is f everyone adults  children
JK Rowlg wh "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" has taken her thrillg series to another heart-poundg level of entertament This is perhaps the most trigug novel of the lot(that's sayg a lot--"Azkaban" was nerve wrackg) It is jam-packed wh so many twists  turns characters  villas jokes  romantic terludes to keep you entertaed f weeks ( is after all over 700 pages)  three days however you tend to read I fall  the latter categy I adm I'm  love wh Harry F good reason Rowlg imbues Harry wh w  charm unlike any children's book hero  recent memy And this book makes Harry even me special  courageous  heroic than ever befe I won't reveal anythg imptant that would be a shame But suffice to say I was kept enthralled f most of the novel (from about 150 pages to the end) This one does take a dark turn  ends on a somber note but  does exactly what  should It keeps the reader  the clutches of Rowlg's masterful epic saga The next three should be stunners I am holdg my breath f Book five Can I der my copy today?
I loved this book! It isn't my fave yet of the Harry Potterseries but  is still very wth readg!  It's amazg howJK Rowlg can keep this 735 page book terestg but she sure does  I don't know  I can wa another year f the next book!
As most readers know sequels are rarely as good as the igal  F a while  seemed as  JK Rowlg's Harry Potter series was the exception to this rule - wh Books Two  Three every b as good  perhaps  even better than the first  Unftunately Rowlgs has struck out wh  Book Four  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire does not live up to s  predecesss  Much of the charm of the first three books  this series  came from the tightly drawn fast movg plots the compellg characters   the delightful descriptions of the magical wld  Unftunately  several of these are lackg  Book Four  First the book is way too  long  Many of the 700 plus pages are taken up wh subplots that do not  add to the ma sty le  could have been easily cut wh no apparent  loss - such as the tale of the Weasley tws' failed bet  Where was the  ed?  Furtherme the sty self seems contrived  Once a reader  reaches the denounement  has all the pieces of the puzzle he can't help  but start wonderg why the bad guys went to all the trouble they did wh  the Triwizards Competion?  After all once the Death Eater filrated  Hogwarts he had ample opptuny to set his trap a lot earlier  the  school year   a much simpler fashion  Looked at  this light the  complicated plotle seems like a Rube Goldberg contraption  Another  problem wh the book is that the character of Harry seems flat lackg  the psychological depth that he had  the pri books  A large part of  what made them so terestg was Harry's complexy  His search f his  roots his need to know his parents  underst who he is explas many  of Harry's actions  the first three books  None of this shows up  Book  Four n does Rowlg replace  wh anythg  Indeed she seems  completely unterested  dealg wh the psychological complexies of  Harry's relationships  F example she completely fails to me the  potentially rich opptuny she had to show Harry wrestlg wh feelgs  of jealousy befe decidg to aid the other Hogwarts' champion  The  result of not dog so is a much less terestg  compellg hero  Fally the tone of the book is too often &quotpreachy&quot  Much of  the action appears to exist primarily f the purpose of teachg mal  lessons  While the messages she seek to impart are praisewthy the way   which Rowlgs is impelled to pot them out  capal letters detracts  from the qualy of the book  Rather than simply lettg the actions of  the characters illustrate the dference between good  evil she  constantly  highlights the pot by havg someone give an awkward soundg  mal lecture  Wness Hermione's denunciations of elf slavery   Hagrid's speech on judgg a person by what they do rather than their  leage  Each time I got to one of these sections I couldn't help  contrastg  wh the me enjoyable ( less wdy) way that another  famous children's auth Dr Seuss made many of the same pots  such  books as Yertle the Turtle  The Sneetches  Despe all my issues wh  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I have to adm that I still enjoyed  readg   Rowlg did as good a job as ever  makg the magical wld  of Hogwart seem to come alive physically  The problem is that by this  pot  the series I am so familiar wh the wonders of talkg  ptras owl mailmen  plates that magically fill up wh food that  they just aren't enough to carry the book by themselveslly rich opptuny she had to show Harry wrestlg wh feelgs  of jealousy befe decidg to aid the other Hogwarts' champion  The  result of not dog so is a much less terestg  compellg hero  Fally the tone of the book is too often &quotpreachy&quot  Much of  the action appears to exist primarily f the purpose of teachg mal  lessons  While the messages she seek to impart are praisewthy the way   which Rowlgs is impelled to pot them out  capal letters detracts  from the qualy of the book  Rather than simply lettg the actions of  the characters illustrate the dference between good  evil she  constantly  highlights the pot by havg someone give an awkward soundg  mal lecture  Wness Hermione's denunciations of elf slavery   Hagrid's speech on judgg a person by what they do rather than their  leage  Each time I got to one of these sections I couldn't help  contrastg  wh the me enjoyable ( less wdy) way that another  famous children's auth Dr Seuss made many of the same pots  such  books as Yertle the Turtle  The Sneetches  Despe all my issues wh  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I have to adm that I still enjoyed  readg   Rowlg did as good a job as ever  makg the magical wld  of Hogwart seem to come alive physically  The problem is that by this  pot  the series I am so familiar wh the wonders of talkg  ptras owl mailmen  plates that magically fill up wh food that  they just aren't enough to carry the book by themselves
This is an credible book f kids  adults  The auth tells a great tale wh generous helpgs of hum sight to the human condion  cleverly veiled social commentary It's scary  sad  parts but  upltg throughout  And the endg sets up the greatest of conflicts  the struggle of good versus evil to be resolved  the later books  Shakespeare had Hamlet ---  Rowlg has The Goblet of Fire
THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF THE HARRY POTTER SERIES IS A GREATREAD AND ENCOURAGED AMONG ALL AGES  A GREAT ADVENTURE AND FUN FORALL SCHOOL KIDS(AGE RANGE 9- AND ON)
Picked  up at midnight the 8th fished  by midnight the 9th! To my  many other readers delight JK Rowlgs added 400 me pages than usual of our fave characters!

This book is awsome! My dad went out  bought  f me at Chooks I love this series Right now I have Namonya  this is a great book to read when you have nothg else to do And this book starts gettg exg at  the first chapter The other ones took a while to get warmed up I really  thk that these are the best books of all time They are a lte violent  But that is what makes  exg I also want to say that these will keep  you entertaed all day long I read a lot And usually there are no good  books out But this one keeps you busy And then  becomes a part of you  I this is the best book ever! Congradulations JK Rowlg!
As many have said Rowlg's ongog plots f Harry Potter have just grown better especially  this fourth book Right from the begng the reader is thrown to a state of suspence  trigue as Voldemt's dark  plans are highlighted early  the novel There is no lack of creativy on  the auth's part as Harry experiences the dangers  challenges of the  Triwizard Tournament the mysteriousness around Mr Crouch  sneaky Ra  Skeeter Yet what astounds me the most is how much symbollism  many  metaphes are cpated throughout the book Rowlg achieves the goal  of makg her characters seem real  their suations very similar to the  Muggles' (us) We are suddenly not the outsiders readg  but the  Hermiones that st up f rights of the elves the Hagrids that are  sometimes put down because of beg dferent  many of the various  passions  concerns that brew as bubbly as a mixture of magic potion
Harry Potter  These two wds can mean so much to the people that read the books  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was everythg expected of : action adventure  heart-stoppg suspense  And yes 's true a  friend of Harry's does die What happens is someone slips Harry's name  to the Goblet of Fire to enter him  the Triwizard Tournament a highly  dangerous competion where there is a possibily of death  No doubt is  there that someone is wkg f Voldemt to see that Harry dies  the  tournament  Two other students from Beauxbatons  Durmstrang other  wizardg schools  Cedric Diggy are chosen to compete  There are 3  tasks they most complete to become wners Strange thgs are  happeng: Death Eaters (Voldemt's suppters) appear at the Quiddch  Wld Cup Harry's name is entered  the Goblet some people go missg   Harry's scar starts hurtg Then at the very end of the last  task Harry fds himself as well as a friend  a suation of  considerable danger (I won't give away the endg) There are some  thgs I can guarantee: Sirius Black will be apart of the book  Harry  won't have a girlfriend (Cho)  Hagrid's le sty will be revealed  Harry will show such strong bravery unlike any befe  And here's an  terestg fact: swn enemies Severus Snape  Sirius black will have a  truce  Another imptant tidb: Voldemt will have risen  Mister  of Magic Cnelius Fudge will not believe he has so he  Dumblede go  their separate ways Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the thickest  yet will defely enchant readers everywhere
I am a parent of 2 kids who love to read the Harry Potter series I read the book  one 10 hour stg Readg 'Goblet of Fire' is an unbelievable experience Aga Rowlgs' imagation amazes  Keep   md though that as Harry gets older age appropriate suations arise  although none that would keep me from lettg my 10 year old  my 8 year  old from readg the book  I recommend parents read the book also  not  just because 's a blast  This chapter  the saga is a b dark  not  as happy go lucky as the pri 3 books Still I'd recommend readg  to  anyone not just kids
The 4th Harry Potter book is the best book yet i cant wa f the fth one Every one whose read the 1st 2nd  3rd books will absolutely LOVE  this one
This book is the awesome sequel to 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as well as the rest of the Potter books  It goes to me depth  feelg than the others  This book will certaly keep you readg over  over aga!  'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' takes place when Harry turns 14the  occurrgs get me trigug  tense Enjoy!  I LOVED IT!  Fellow  Potter fans will love  all the same!
When you first see this massive book on the shelves you may thk  is Stephen Kg's new novel but no  It is 734 pages of a children's book  Once you get over the size of the book  beg   actually goes que  quickly  It has all the action comedy  fun of the other 3 books only  wh somethg new: romance!  Harry Potter seems me real of a character   this book as he goes through the many feelgs of adolescence  I don't  thk real young kids can read this book because  has a lot of dficult  vocabulary  If they have a dictionary near-by I recommend this great book  to everyone!
I had serious doubts about how JK Rowlg would keep up the momentum of the first three unbelievable books  this her fourth novel  I thought I had the plot all figured out down to the last detail but I was very wrong  I was disapoted  fdg out who was the last contestant  the  Triwizard tournament was as I knew that was gog to happen  You'll know  what I mean when you read   Otherwise I am yet aga amazed at the  qualy of plot suspense elements  my own desire to keep this book open  until the end!  I lerally could not put this book down  My only problem now is havg to wa f the next one!
&quotDarker&quot is the wd used to describe this volume  This means  may well be appropriate f younger readers  My daughter age 9 who loved the first 3 volumes is losg sleep over The Goblet of FireRead  first  It's rivetg but not what I'd call a kid's book
This book was simply enchantg 10 out of 5 stars I was hooked after the first chapter I have loved all of the HP books so far but this is defately the best! If you haven't read  yet I DEFINATELY recommend !  You just can't say enough good thgs about this book!- Josh
Book four of the Harry Potter series is every b as good as the first three! Each is a wonderful mystery wh surprisg twists  hysterical turns The series really does build as you go along so you should read  them  der  you'll spoil the surprise Rowlg is a great wrer Her  books make enjoyable readg f adults too That's rare: not many kids  books please adults (the Hobb  Watership Down are the two I'm thkg  of)The series is a ltle b dark though-- remds me of Roald Dahl  (James  the Giant Peach etc) Book one was great f all ages but  they get spookier as you go along Book four might be a b too much f  very young kids (Then aga  you let them read Goosebumps these books  are pretty tame)
This book is simply the best book I have ever read!  All the thgs you want to see happen do happen!  JK Rowlg is simply a mastermd at showg the complex personalies  tras of all the characters  If you  buy this book you won't be disappoted!  Please buy !  It's wonderful!
In the fourth stalment of Harry Potter JK Rowlg has me than lived up to the expectations of her fans  The book is filled wh twist  turns that will delight her readers It was a thourghly enjoyable experience   I eagerly awa the contued adventures of Harry Potter
This is the longest book  the whole series  As you read  you feel like you don't want to stop  you want to read me  As you fish the book  leaves you to image what Harry's summer will be like  Some  books you fish  you say&quotWell that was okay&quot  you don't  give the book a second thought but wh the fourth Harry Potter book you  just keep playg  replayg parts of the sty  your head until you  fally decide to just read the whole thg aga  I haven't done that yet  but I will
Perhaps the most amazg part of JK Rowlgs' success wh Harry Potter is that she seems to get better wh each book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an amazg piece of wk: an over-700 page book that will leave  young readers wishg  was longer It will be hard to wa f the next  one my only consolation is that the book is so long  will take months to  read  to my daughters By then we'll hopefully be close to Rowlgs'  next stallment  this wonderful series
The latest book  the Harry Potter series was whout a doubt the greatest yet  The book provides a great deal of mystery terwoven  the plot as well as lots of hum to lighten the feel of the sty JK Rowlg contues to amaze wh her crafty plot twists as well as the genius   thoughly unique sub-plots  the character development is very strong   I was pleased to see me of Albus Dumblede the Weasley family   Harry's Godfather Sirius  This is truly as the book cover says a pivotal  novel  the series  a very tumultuous time f Harry as he begs to  grow up I would even reccomend this book to me mature readers who may  fd that they greatly enjoy some of the m aspects of the sty  If I  could have I would have rated this book wh 8  9 stars  I will be  eagerly awag the comg of the 5th novel (please e-mail me  you have  any fmation on that topic)
I liked this new book a lot but  was defely geared toward an older age group than the first three  the series  Besides seeg the students deal wh crushes the sty has a me serious undertone   has less  of a self-contaed plot than the first three Harry Potters  However   still had the hum  wacky plot reversals that made the other three  books so wonderful  It was really good
Beg familiar wh Harry  Hogwarts you will be surpriced that this book doesn't start wh Harry   you also will be amazed what that school holds  ste this year The book me  me volves the magic wld  outside of Hogwarts which I truly believe enlightens the wrg Great  adventures are mixed wh typical teenager problems covered  Magic Do  not miss : But - as others said befe me start wh the first three  they build up  Loved  just like the first ones  can't wa f No  5
I'm a b biased I've thought Harry Potter was AWESOME fromthe beggng  Yet this 4th Harry Potter book Harry Potter  theGoblet of Fire totally blows the other books away  It's size might scare you but trust me the 734 pages is wth   If you are only 5  might scare you the plot is defely gettg darker  And I can't believe that  oooh i can't spoil the endgDon't read on  you don't want to know the basic plotAt the beggng we are at the Riddle house  fd that Voldemt wh the assistance of Wmtail is planng to kill Harry  Harry sees the Wld Cup where dangerous thgs happen at the end He stays wh the Weasley's until school starts  Once there he fds that there is to be no Quiddch this year just the Triwizard Tournament  no surprise after somethg VERY strange he is part of   Dangerous Dark  You have to read  to believe !THIS BOOK IS REALLY REALLY &ltu&gtREALLY&lt/U&gt GREAT!
While I may qualy as a child only  my imagation that is me than enough to enjoy the latest Harry Potter book: the Goblet of Fire  In the simplest of wds I could NOT put  down!  There is ltle question that  these novels are gettg better wh each stallment  I have to say I  am very glad I preder this one!  I spent Saturday  my imagation    was wonderful  The endg was fantastic (though I will not give away  any me than that)  the rest of the sty was carried along by equal  amounts of darg suspense  lighthearted hum  From Privet Drive to  Hogwarts the Goblet lived up to  outdid s predecesss  a beautul  weavg of multiple sty threads  Like the other Potter books the scenes  are well wrten the characters telligently crafted  the sense of  sty range wh real emotion that has an appeal across age  background  An unequivocal Must Read f anyone who still as a ltle child somewhere   the imagation
This book was a compelg sty of a young boy who faces many challenges not only of adolesence but of the wizardg wld Harry Potter has aga come back  this fourth novel to be challenged by Voldemt  his arch  enemy Draco Malfoy This book even though long was one of the greater  books  the series so far  The plot was treagg  the sty le  was carried very well through out the sty  I give this amazg book 5  stars because  is amazg how mystygly gr  is
Book Four  JK Rowlg's Harry Potter series is no dissapotment  I fished all 734 pages  can not wa f me The Goblet of Fire is perhaps a b me sister  parts than the other books but I also  found  me meangful  There are great lessons on friendship loss   the treatment of others to be learned  this book Hopefully  Rowlg's young  not so young readers will take this away after the  back cover is closed  The ma characters are the same yet a b older  I admire how well Rowlg has developed Harry Ron  Hermione to su  their ages  At fourteen they take an terest  the oppose sex yet  still have plenty of time f snoopg around around Hogwarts obsessg  over Quiddch  enjoyg Bertie Bott's Every Flav Beans  There is  me teraction between m  maj characters which is terestg  Also we fally meet the two oldest Weasley Brothers  A wonderful read!
I love the Harry Potter books  like millions of others was countg the days until the release of book four  When I fally recieved my copy I fished   one day  Like all the others  is filled wh a mixture  of hum suspense  countless unsuspected turns  If you have not yet  gotten your hs on a copy of this book I suggest you do so very soon
JK Rowlg's books just keep gettg better  better!  In the fourth book Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts f his fourth year  There is never a dull moment  his le that's f sure!  It's hard enough beg an  everyday kid but throw  a malicious wizard who has captured the fear of  millions  the wizardg wld  there's bound to be some excement  This is an excellent read  everyone who likes fantasy should read !
I'm me 30 years older than the kids this book is wrten f yet I can't help but get swept away by   I can underst why kids want to read these books over  over--the characters plot  scenery are  vividly wrten  If you can affd  consider buyg a second Goblet of  Fire as a gt f your neighbhood library which I'm sure will have a  tremendously long wag list of children wantg to read this book   the earlier volumes
Yes 's over 700 pagesbut I still fished   onenight You won't fd yourself countg pages left I promiseYes's up to par  Rowlg contues wh some threads she'd started  earlier books  starts some terestg new onesGoblet of Fire is a ltle darker than the earlier books but I still found myself laughg out loud  several spots If there's anyone left who hasn't read the earlier books 's best to start at the begng  wk your way through but Goblet of Fire does have plenty of remders  explanations of what happened  the earlier books  case you've fgotten anythgAlso a comment to parents who might be thkg of not lettg their children read Goblet of Fire: please consider these pots Do you want to deprive your children of the chance to read a book of both lerary  mal value that is still fun to read? Do you really want to keep them away from a book that has turned me non-readers to enthusiastic readers than anythg  recent memy?  Do you want to keep them from a sty that teaches loyalty perseverance courage  the value of learng  of dependent thought?  END
Harry Potter  the Gobl of Fire is the best book I've read  my entire le  I LOVE the Harry Potter series  all of JK Rowlg's books are great but out of the 4 Harry Potter books the best yet is defley  this one  I suggest you read  over  over until you agree!  But anyway   you haven't read any Harry Potter books don't read this one first 'll  spoil everythg  I gave this book five stars because this is one of the  best books of all time  Wh 734 pages 's filled wh a sty of magic  a fictional wld  so many other thgs that will make you never want  to put this book down  READ HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLIN OF FIRE TODAY!
I thk that this book is very good It is dferent from the others which were  very similar This book were a lot deeper than the others which is what I like I did miss quiddch a lot but that was ok I also would have  preffered a longer wld cup but the bok was long enough as  was It was  suspensfull enough that I that I read the whole thg  16 hours  so (I  fished at about 3:30  the mng) Well anyway  was very good  I  would reccomened  to most people While younger children(under 10) would  defanately underst  older children will appriciate  much me
This is Mrs Rowlg's best book yet All the magic  suspence is combed to fm the best novel so far  the series Harry  all of his friends enemies are back  this sty  this proves to be the creme de  la creme of all fantasy books Knowg how much i have waed f this the  book really made all those months of wag wth  The detail   description the auth provides will make your eyes grow wide wh  excment just like me did I hope everyone enjoyed  as much as i did
And better than ever This is the best book of all It not only has the most twists  turns    has the best endg  's fun to read I love Harry Potter!  I hope the other JK Rowlg Books are as good as  this!
Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire was my fave book  the series I liked  because  put me suspence through the whole book Now I can't wa f the next one!
I bought the lastest Harry Potter book wh some hesantion that  could not live up to the 3rd book  By god  has! This book is the best one  the serieswh amazg characters  wh the girfted wrgs of JK Rowlg no one will be let down!
This book is fantastic! The antics of Harry Ron  Herome are always a treat! They are great characters to grow up wh  there is always somethg new to learn about them! The plot le draws the reader   you can bet you'll be up all night fishg  off! It's a wonderful book  great f all agesLd Voldermt is up to his old tricks  are they  new? New &quotMad Eye&quot vades the scene along wh Ra the rovg  repter Harry's wld is turned upside down by false news sties  Hagrid's hrible animals  the Triwizard cup Can he w ? Or is   not wth ? Watch Harry explode  this awesome 4th novel =)
When Rowlg said this was the most imptant novel of the series I was skeptical wouldn't the fal one hold that hon  I was very wrong this book was by far the best of the series  I have no doubt I will be sayg  the same about the next one  It's dficult to talk about the book whout  spoilg  f somebody but  is defely wth the read  you will  be cravg f me Potter at the end
JK Rowlg is a master of her craft! How many auths could possibly wre a book over 700 pages long  keep someone's rapt attention from start to fish? I am a 24-year old English graduate  I love Harry  Potter!  Rowlg's plots get better  better wh each new book  her  wrg is credible She has vented a whole new vocabulary wh the  creative wds she has coed like &quotMuggles&quot   &quotQuiddch&quot I won't tell you anythg about the plot but I will  tell you  you are a fan you owe  to yourself to read this book as  quickly as possible On the other h  might be best to take your time  as we do have a WHOLE YEAR to wa until we can enjoy another Harry  adventure
F a book of 700 pages plus I found that I fished  too fast  I wanted  to go on f another 700 pages  after all that happened I was left anxious f the next book  After all of the media hype about a  character dyg I was pleasantly releived when I came to that part  I  also found the new character(s) were very terested  would like to see  them  the next books  Some histy of certa characters was also very  good  answered alot of questions  All  all I felt that this was by  far the best book yet  am ready f me  Too bad there are only 3  me books to come  It's a must read!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is not only as rivetg as the first three books but  considerably exps  deepens the trajecty of this series:  good versus evil But the evil is not only  supernatural 's also clearly becomg identied wh the  attudes of  those who believe that Muggles are a cruptg fce  an abomation   the wizardg wld And although 's done wh some hum there's an  terestg subplot about house elves  slavery (remember Dobby?) It also  develops the characters further some unexpectedly f example Albus  Dumblede Severus Snape  even Hagrid And though one of the characters  dies (I'm not gog to spoil  by tellg) Rowlg's hum remas  tact The conflicts between Harry  Ron  Ron  Hermione are  particularly well executed  the reader never fgets that the three  ma young characters are kids ( ones now copg wh puberty) even   they can perfm magic  Rowlg cludes the bld alleys  red herrgs  she excels at creatg which provide their usual suspense As Rowlg has  said this is the pivotal book  she's pulled  off aga
This fourth stallment of Harry's le has me permanently hooked  I'm 22  loved the book--my bros aged 1612&amp 9  my mother (50-ish) have all fished  loved the book  Admtedly the youngest had a  nightmare  two related to the sty but we're all permanent fans  Thanks Rowlg f wrg a book that's so enthrallg f all ages!
I am a very big fan of Harry Potter  I just recieved the fourth book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I thk that this is an excellent book but I feel that there is no need to put some of the language  there  that there is f stance: swearg  Isn't this supposed to be a  children's book?  I had noticed  the other three books an occasional  swear wd but this book has contaed the most out of all of them  I  thk that this is an excellent book but parents might be wary when givg  this book to their children to read
JK Rowlg has outdone herself yet aga  the fourth book of the Harry Potter series The me I read of her books the me I am sure that  is MS Rowlg who is the magician  not her characters this book like  the fmer was filled wh the dry br tongue  cheek hum that is so  customary  wrers such as Roald Dhal  Rowlg I feel that MS  Rowlg went to much greater emotional depth  this book   the  detailg of magical phemomenon was such that I could see  happeng  befe my eyes! If Ms Rowlg contues to wre  this ve I will be  her most ardent fan!
who will fally perm my 15 year old daughter to get her hs on this book - because I fished readg  last night (three days after  was released)  The first three books were fun  This one is even better  It's  me complex Harry  his schoolmates are a ltle older  much me  mature than when we first met them  The suations that they face are me  complicated  they have me autonomy to make decisions  take  responsibily f the consequences of their choices  behavi F the  first time the ma characters beg to consider their careers  the  wizardg wld &quotShall I use my trag to become an Aur   ?&quot  If the reader has read all three previous books the  characters are old friends  As friendships develop we learn me about our  friends we underst me  we care a great deal me  In this book  we deepen our friendships wh Harry ron  Hermione  We accept their  character qualies both strengths  weaknesses  scerely wish them  well on their journey through this stage of their lives  The characters  are drawn wh much me detail than the earlier younger books  The plot  action is very tricate  yes I will need to re-read this book next  week to sav the details  The settg is magnicent  How wizards wh  great abilies co-exist  a wld wh mere muggles is the stuff of  enchantment Suspendg disbelief enough to accept ptkeys The Wld  Quiddch Cup championship game  the magical curriculum at Hogwarts is  wth readg late to the night  beg sleepy at wk the next  mng  However my young patients are impressed that I can discuss Harry  Potter wh them  detail I only wish I had the wisdom of Profess  Dumblede
This time around Harry's a ltle older  a lot wiser  F the first time we see him have somethg of a love terest ( we become terested  somethg brewg between Harry's two closest friends?)  The plot is amazgly elabate  que unpredictable as always this book has been  enchanted wh a b of magic that won't let the reader put  down  It is  funny touchg  downright scary  I won't divulge any secrets but  here's a ht: me people than Harry are speakg You-Know-Who's real  name!  Altogether a wonderful ( not-so-quick!) read - fly don't walk  to buy this book!
The fourth  the series opens a b dferently than the previous books which makes f a nice swch  There are plenty of great new characters troduced cludg Bill  Charlie Ron Weasley's older brothers  I  liked the way Harry was challenged to face tasks  his fourth year  stead of the route battles wh troll bogarts  ghosts  I did miss  the Quiddch matches but as always the reader is wowed by Harry's flyg  abily  his faceoff agast the dragon  Harry also showed a lot of  tegry durg task two   was nice to see that the thg he would  miss the most is a person who means a lot to him rather than a posession   As always Harry trimuphs over the most dficult of tasks  ends up   the hospal wg but  wouldn't be a nmal year at Hogwarts f him   he didn't  A great adventure  I can't wa f the next one!
OH MY GOD This book was so awesome I went wh my parents to go get  the night  came out  stayed up all night readg  I like Harry Potter because he does all this cool stuff  has all these cool friends  And he has this magic w that he can use to do stuff I wish I had a  magic w It's too bad I don't But Harry Potter has a magic w I wish  Harry Potter was real  then he could come over to my house  we could  do stuff together But back to this book I was nervous about readg   because  was really big  didn't have many pictures But I stayed up  all night  my Mommy  Daddy helped me wh the big wds  we did   There were scary parts but we got through them together And there's  this part where Harry Potter does this thg 's so cool Harry Potter  is off the hook And I mean OFF THE HOOK And  you don't like Harry  Potter you can go well I don't know where I wish I was me like Harry  Potter Maybe someday I will be But first I have to believe  myself  Harry Potter taught me that
i was really impressed wh the book as  was sooo long butreally kept me terested  what was happeng  the romance betweencho  harry  hermione  krum etc was a ltle stf  really only just glanced the surface of real le attudesThe overall aura of the book also is a ltle me scary  Not particularly hryg but panicky  wrisome All  all a great read! (i fished   a weekend)
Perhaps the rush to get out a monster seller diluted the thkg that went to this book  Parents would be better off readg Robson Crusoe to their kids than the latest version of Harry picks your parents pockets
I picked up the first Harry Potter book when I heard  was beg panned by the extreme christian fundimentists as encouragg children to believe  magic  use magic wds  Sce when has childhood not cluded magic  The Harry Potter series is as entertag f adults as f children (  myself beg a Masters degree nurse  my SO a Computer dweeb) The  characters are entertag well wrten  dynamic  The magic   mysteries will keep you guessg a thoughly as  an Agatha Christie novel  I can hardly wa f the next book OR failg that Can I have my letter  to Hogwats Please I have magic  me!
Even though I am long past my fmative years I have been wag impatiently f the fourth Harry Potter book sce I fished The Prisoner of Azkaban It seems like every book got better that the book befe  I  reread the first three several times as I waed f Goblet of Fire's  release dateGoblet of Fire is much longer than s predecesss It  also unfolds much me slowly Harry doesn't even get to Hogwart's until  the 11th chapter It is also a b darker than the previous three books   the endg doesn't end as tidily as they didAll that beg said this  is a really wonderful book You can tell that Joanne Rowlg doesn't have  &quota fmula&quot She has a sty to tell  stays true to that sty  even though tellg  properly requires a change of pace from the previous  novels This book is still as grippg as are all the Harry Potter books  (judgg by the fact that I read all 636 pages  2 days) This is also a  novel that you can read  reread because there are so many clues that  every time you read you fd thgs you missed the first time around To me  that is the sign of a truly great novelIf you haven't read Harry Potter  yet you really need to get all four bookspch a tent away from the  hubbub of daily le  immerse yourself  the magical wld of Harry  Ron Hermione (they fally tell you how to pronounce her name  this  book)  the rest of the characters at Hogwart's If you have read them  read them aga - they get better the me you read!
I am so happy that this book met the same qualy as rowlgs first three I fished   three days  hope to start readg  aga I thk harry potter is the best Number four proves to be scarier  me entertag then the first three by far I cannot wa f number 5
JK Rowlg has exceeded my expectations  I was eagerly anticipatg readg me of Harry's adventures on the Quiddch field  scrapes wh danger as he contued his studies as Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry  However I was not disappoted to fd other players on the  Quiddch field  the book of Harry Potter  the Goblet of FireMy  level of uneasess grew as JKRowlg developed layer upon layer of  suspenseful episodes throughout Harry's fourth year  I was not prepared  f the twist of events that unfurled as Harry met students from other  wizardry schools  events confirmed his suspicions of familiar  acquatances  The tempo of encounters wh peril  you-know-who varied  just enough to keep me off guard  I rema  awe of JK Rowlg's  creative abily to draw readers to the magical wld at HogwartsMany  families have enjoyed previous Harry Potter books to read aloud together  JK Rowlg's art cleverly creates stressful environments  The Goblet of  Fire that may be too tense f some young readers  My family was  thrilled to read a book wh suspense tture mystery  death whout  the prolonged ge  gristly details geared toward the older reader  Parents will be sensive to their own children's emotional development   recognize that this book is f readg aloud after the ltle ones have  gone to bed
As an 8th grade english teacher I am always tryg to stay on top of the newest books my students may enjoy--I must say that the Potter series of books has been my selfish dulgement!  It is so refreshg to read  adolescent lerature that I enjoy!  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is such  a wonderful sequel--just as excg  unpredictable as the first three  of the series!  I was a ltle nervous when I received the book-- beg  so large  all however  was a super easy read  I could hardly put   down!  I would defately recommend this book to both young people   those who are young at heart!
The first amazement provided by Harrry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the size of the book  At 734 pages  is massive  The second amazement is how quickly that is fgotten as one gets drawn to Harry's most unusual  wld  As the fourth book  the series I expected a b of a fmula I  couldn't have been me wrong  There is nothg fmula-like about this  book  Many thgs like the Mauraduer's Map  house elves from the  previous books appear once aga but  unexpected ways  The returng  characters are growg  learng  so don't always behave as they did  when they were younger  As an adult I am throughly enchanted by the  unexpected twists  turns  this book  The Goblet of Fire sts alone  as a amazg book you don't have to read the others to underst   enjoy  but you'll want to!
What has truly astounded me about this series is that as the characters mature so do the plots  Wh this book our heroes start to turn to teenagers complete wh moodess puppy love  concern about what their peers actually thk of them  Likewise their awareness of the wld  around them contues to crease  what appeared to be a simple  childish wld of magic  the first book becomes a me sophisticated  trigug place  I hope that this style of sty tellg will contue  wh the next three books- I thk  is an excellent way to develop a  series coverg several years from a character's le  will appeal to  younger readers who are growg up even as the characters are  I'm sure  the backlash is already risg agast this book just because  has  already been so successful  Igne that  Read   Then tell all the  Muggles to jump  a lake
I just fished the book today after readg almost nonstop f two days I must say that this is one of the best books I have ever read  a great addion to the Harry Potter style  The plot kept the pages turng   one new dovelopment added to another  Highly recomended
Yet aga Rowlg has transpted her readers back to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry this time you'd better hang on because 's one wild ride!In this book readers are plunged even me deeply to  the plot  discover even me about the excellent characters that  populate Harry's wld  You'll meet old friends new foes dazzlg  creatures  encounter excellent twists  turns  this rivetg  adventureA delight f all ages the newest stallment of the Harry  Potter series is sure to live up to the stards of the rest of the books  It's trigug magical   will leave you yearng f the release  of Book 5!
I personally thk that this is the best book yet  the series It cludes very terestg charecters  has a dferent atmosphere than the other books me of an older teenage atmosphere I beleive that this is  also the scariest  the most exg book of the series It was great!  I would like to tell me but I wouldn't want to give  away so  you  want to know me you better hurry  get this book  read  your self
This Book is Better then the Best! I loved  so much  only took me three days to read ! I stayed up late  to the night to read   I woke up at 5:00  the mng to read Of course the other books  the  series are great too but this one is unspeakibly great It is so amazg  how by the first page you are already deeply  love wh this book I cant  image how anybody could not like this bookI actually feel like I'm  there The book actually pulls yourself  to HarryRonHermoe  so  many other characters shoesIt is Better than the Best!
I could not put  down until I had fished   At the Quiddch Wld Cup the Death Sign  the march of the Death Eaters demonstrate that He Who Must Not Be Named is gag power  On returng to school Harry learns that there will be a Triwizard Tournament  An older student from  each of the three wizard schools will compete f the Triwizard Cup  Suddenly Harry fds himself  the middle of the competion  Who got  past the age le to enter his name?  Who was able to confound the Goblet  of Fire to trick  to a fourth contestant?  Evil is aloft
This book was great the sty was engagg the characters full of le  the events  the sty so vivid I could see  played out befe my eyes - especially durrg one of the sty's fal scenes but I won't go  to that This is defately one of the best sties I have ever read The  book might be a ltle scary f young readers by the wrg is so good   the sty so amazgly engagg  excg that denyg a child such  a wonderful piece of lterature would be wse This is a sty that  children teens  parents can throughly enjoy I know that I certaly  did
This is one of my second fave book only under the bible I wish I could put six stars! If you liked any of the first three boxsjust a ltle you'l love this one Its so good I couldn't put  down Evan that s  seven hundred  thirty four pages long  goes by REALY fast It reviles  me about alot of the old characters  troduces you to many many  me After you read  you'l underst why the last chapter is called  &quotThe Begg&quot The only problem I have about the book is that   leaves you hangg teribly You could be on Gigo's &quotWe All Do Dumb  Thgs&quot commursel  you don't get this book!
This book was very good - right from the get go The first chapter had me thkg why was the family name familiar The Quiddch wld cup was a lot of fun   kept gettg better Towards the middle wh the great  ball -  got a ltle slow but  picked - the tournament was terestg  - especially sce cheatg was part of  And the last contest had me  readg non stop till the end Voldemt is back  I cant wa to see  what happens next - sigh have to wa a year Ltle frustated that people  dont listen to Harry  dont belive that you-know-who is back but will see  what happens next
This is by far the best book I have ever read  I've read a lot Full of excement  adventure the fourth book  the series is simply stunng The first chapter chills you to the ce  you've read all  three books befe As usual  the HP series the book is full of twists   turns However the book contas murders of fave characters  fally seeg Dumblede angry  most chillg of all the risg of  Voldemt This book is soso thrillg I was actualy sobbg at the  end of  Unftunately this book is very very sad  I wouldn't  recommend  to anyone below the age of 7    Don't waste time!  Pick up this book now!
WowThis weekend my 11-year-old son my we  I all read the new Harry Potter book  How is this possible f a 734-page book?  We made some ground rules  stuck to them (you can't take the book away from someone  until they've fished a chapter you can't keep the book from someone   you're not readg  yourself no spoilers no takg the book out of the  house)The sht review:  this is the best one yet  Rowlg's  imagation is exhaustible the characters grow  change  unexpected  but absolutely right ways  the struggle between good  evil is me  grippg than everAlthough I'll post a longer review later I'll get to  the most imptant pot now  The only plausible reason I have ever seen  f not buyg the Harry Potter books is a wry by some Christians that  the emphasis on magic  wchcraft is somehow unhealthyAll I can  say is that those books are spirually  the right place --  is VERY  clear what the dference is between good  evil  which side we should  be fightg on even at the cost of great pa sacrice  deathThe latest book is the best yet  this respect -- the villas are much  me openly evil  yet the reader understs why they choose that path  [ht: power  pride] while learng both the ultimate soul-destroyg  hr of   the necessy of fightg  at ALL times (every choice  you ever make beg potentially decisive)
This was the best harry potter book yet I am a college student  this series has restilled a sense of wonder  fantasy lerature  the thg that I liked the most about this book is that as harry has grown older the  books have matured  both tone  content I don't want to spoil the book  f anyone but the dance scene remds me pafully of my  first dance  harry is growg up  the sty is growg up wh him the only problem  I have is that the trials do not seem that dficult except f the first  one  small matter  This book is great  I hope the next one is even  longer
This is by far the best Harry Potter book As an adult I've enjoyed readg these as much as any child Filled wh imagation sight  yes rivetg plot twists the Harry Potter series is dested to be a  classic In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Harry begs to mature  to adulthood  learn the true meangs of magic friendship  fear  In his fourth year Harry encounters characters whose actions  the past  have affected him his friends  his future In this book  Rowlg  deepens Harry's sty revealg poignant  sometimes tragic aspects of  m characters  a way that humanizes what until now have been  relatively flat characters  Whout spoilg the read  is safe to say  that Harry is selected to test his mettle as a wizard  a unique   challengg contest Behd the scenes however lurks an all too familiar  evil that is out to kill Harry  do much wse Parents will be pleased  that this book treats the hric  tragic happengs  a way that is  sensive  thought provokg As Rowlg's child audience matures so  Harry has grown  experienced le  such a way as to fulfill one of the  goals of all lerature--to fm  enterta
This book is the most remarkable book I have ever read  I have read a LOT of books! Harry Potter books have the reputation of beg just f kids but I know people from 7 to 70 who enjoy them This book cludes  everythg: w suspense likeable characters  a good solid plotle  This is the kd of book that you can't put down after you start  Don't  let the 730 pages  the book fool you  will be over befe you know   If you want to read somethg that will make you laugh out loud  that  will make you feel that you're there wh the characters read Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire You'll be glad you did
My 8 year-old son  I prepared f book IV by re-readg books I-III which was a great way to remember  discover new details about Harry's wldI have now just fished readg Book IV on my own Ms Rowlg  did not disappot!  This book was as thrillg  complex as book 3  It's excg to keep fdg out me about the wizardg wld through  Harry's eyes  This book answers alot of questions about Harry's past but  asks alot me as well  The adults know alot me about Harry's family  then they are tellg him  I guess we will have to wa f future books  to answer those questionsIn the meantime Ms Rowlg aga adds vivid  details to this wld  leaves the reader wantg to know when Book 5  will be published I loved the ltle jokes  comments on Wizard polics   wk  And the bathroom alone is enough to make you want to be a  prefectThese books are great f anyone you don't have to be a child  to love Harry Potter  I hope Ms Rowlg doens't stop wrg about this  wld once Harry graduatesAnd 5 stars to Amazon f sendg the the  book Fedex! It was great to get the book the same day!
All i have to say is wow!  ( well not all I have to say but most of ) I have been wag f this book f a long time  fally on suday july 9 i got !   was the most hrible thg i did to get this book but i  won't tell cause 's just mean!   no i did not steal !  well not  really!  but yeah this book does not seem like a childrens book at all  there are a lot of deep thgs  this book that the other book did not  even touch! i'm just amazed by the book She draws you   you actually  feel what Harry is gog though 's really great!  But i do advise that  you read all of the books befe you read this one cause then you will  just get a better understg of !  NOW i'm wag till the NEXT book  will come out!  i really want to know what happens!  ps i just fished  this book!  took me about 1 1/2 days!  not striaght though!
Tilte summarizes  all  If you liked the first three books you'll like this one too  be wantg Book 5!  New readers should start wh the the first book stead of tryg to figure  all out by startg book  4It's long - took a while to get gog I was wonderg after the first  third   would be flat  leave the series stred but  picked up   drove onwards to a good fish  Me fmation  plot layers are  added to the struggle between good &amp evil  It's turng from an  terestg book about a young wizard (Book 1) to a longer series on the  struggle between G&ampE wh Harry takg a me active role  Parallels:  the Tolkien &quotLd of the Rgs&quot books the three igal Star  Wars movies - - wh &quotGoblet of Fire&quot as the second  book/movieF me  fulfilled expectations  Nice job JK Rowlg!
This book is truly the best book ever  Of all the books that I have read the Harry Potter series is the best  of all the Harry Potter series Goblet of Fire is the best  It makes me want to goto Hogwarts  makes me feel as though I really am there  It is hillarious  terryg  There is even a ball!  If you are terested  fantasy  even  your  not this is the book f you
You probably would thk after Harry Potter's 3rd book nothg could be better Yet JK Rowlg has surprised us agian wh this thrillg novel that has us screamig f me In this book much me plots are  happeng around Harry This book may be much longer but f the true  Harry Potter fan this is an added bonus At the end of this book we all  ask the same question- What happens next?
Well at 750 pages this new Harry Potter book still reads like one half that length Not a sgle chapter feels too long  drawn out You'll fd yourself stg up readg  all nightI fished  three days Buy  this book Read the others too
I am 30 years old  I must say this book is one of the best books I have read  my le Simply amazg this book is Very dark  deadly  brgs back Harry Potter series to square one You will know what I meant after you read  JK Rowlg has out done herself  this book wh  unfgetable characters  sister plot Me  me her wrg is  maturg  so are the characters I would say this series is no longer a  children's but a full blown Myster/Suspense/Hr book that one would  expect from Dean Koontz  Stephen Kg Thk twice befe you read this  book to kids under 12 years old Nevertheless very entertag   utterly fulfillg
It's no wonder parents  kids will st  le at midnight to buy this book  Rowlg's sight to her readers' terests is credible  You can read this book purely as an adventure  you're say 8 years old   sav  f s subtle hum  w  you're between 11  71  appreciate s comg-of-age aspects  you're 17  adolescence is old  news  anticipate wh pleasure  a b of a frisson what You-know-who  is up to  how Harry will save the day even  you're only six The only  books I can compare these to f breadth of appeal  sensivy are  Tolkien's Ld of the Rgs series If you're not  le right now fd a  le  get  !
I thk the the 4th Harry Potter Book is the best  the series yet It's a really excg book  I loved  I liked all of the mystery surrondg the new characters  mystery surrondg the old The book was  well wrten The only bad part of  was that  was a b long (734 pages  long to be exact) All  all I really recomend the book  readers of  all ages will like 
This is a very excg stallment of Harry Potter  true to her wd is also the darkestBut 's the same old likeable Harry Potter As I read I felt the same joy as wh the first three no stylistic leaps here The plot despe 's signature twists sticks close to the stard Harry Potter fmulae[When I igally wrote this review  was the day after the book was released  there might have been some pot  actually discussg the book At this pot however I'm embarrassed to even have this review onle I mean who hasn't already read this book? And  not why not?]
Arrivg on your dostep wh impressive heft the latest stallment of the joy that is the Harry Potter series hs 's mark aga While the fourth book is as promised somewhat darker  nature fans will not be  disappoted  the growth of Harry's character Ms Rawlgs is clearly  weavg f us a long elabate maly play cludg themes of social  justice courage loyalty  civil rights but she is dog  wh  lightness  whout abong her tricate  fantastical plot Best  of all Ms Rawlgs opens a wld of growg-up that ves discussion   challenges the imagations of our children Now  we could only fd  a house elf f our house!
In our town the appearance of the latest Harry Potter book wh s attendant media-hype has revalized summer readg  readg out loud (so that whole families can share one copy) skills thought to be lost  sce the advent of television In my opion  does live up to s  expectations both posive  negative  The new book is actually a  slightly easier read than the others generally matas a compellg  plot  has good development of the existg characters wh the  exception of Albus Dumblede  My maj complat is that the omniscient   ever-kdly Dumblede is pushed too far  this one especially   regard to his relationship wh Hagrid  I could do wh a few fewer  &quotGreat man Dumblede &quot  at least a flaw  two  I also  suspect that some of the weaker characterizations of the new characters  might have been improved wh a longer gestation time but  is  fundamentally a good book
I have read all of the Harry Potter books like just about everyone else  when i got the new one i stayed up all night  half the next day to read   It was very unusual!  It defatly compares wh the other books   the series  A must buy f anyone at all!
The fourth harry potter book was wonderful  brgs back characters from previous books  adds a lot to the ongog sty le F me I thought  was an emotion filled book wh suprisg plot twists that you would  never have guessed It is as actioned packed as the books preceedg  It  keeps you terested you never get board! I would tell everyone to read  this book I just wish the next one was already out!
It's too bad that this review thg will only let you choose 5 as the highest because  deserves at least a 10 This book was the best out of the four so far but 's length made  a ltle harder to follow I have  read books much longer than this one but everythg  this book seemed  kd of hurried compared to the previous three The events  new  characters   are just as igal  creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books I was afraid that Rowlg might  have lost a ltle b of her creativy  somethg but I assure you  this one captured me  pulled me to  just like the other ones The  whole plot  sty le are amazg  you'd never be able to guess what  happens I read the book  less than two days simply because I couldn't  put  down I was fced to keep readg  I even delayed meals to  squeeze  some me readg The entire book was thoughly enjoyed    was better than I expected  to be Many unexpected turns  the book made   me enjoyable Although this book was a ltle b darker  me  mysterious than the first  third ones I still thk  had the most  volved  complicated plot which made  better than the others I am  very glad that I went to the bookste at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book It was extremely good  completely wth readg I hope  I  certaly thk that everyone will agree when I say that JK Rowlg has  caught the snch aga wh another awesome Harry Potter tale
This book captures the magical sense of the followg three books but adds a touch of hr  realization of how terrible Voldemt is The endg is que a shocker  leaves you a b breathtaken A must read  book f all Potter fans
I thought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great book because I found  wasn't as far-fetched  spooky as the the 2nd Harry Potter book The Chamber of Secrets although there is some danger    I liked the fact that certa characters cludg James  Lilly Potter   Wmtail were brought back to this particular book  This book is very  suspenseful  some parts are very humous  Even though Harry has a  secret crush  doesn't get to anythg extremely mushy
I thk that this book is awesome I mean all the Harry Potter books are awesome This is one of those books where you start   can't put  down until the very last wd Its unpredictable  keeps your md  thkg 'till the very end I recommend this book to all ages of readers  lookg f adventure This is a must read book I give  two ws up
The truth is I'm a b ashamed to be caught up  a children's book so much  However at times I fd  me trigug than  classics I have read  as well wrten as any book tended f  adultsThe first three Potter books were good  Each volume stood on s  own as a great book while beg just one  a series of seven books  This  book was defely the best most entertag stallment  all the  way through  had the feel of the first book  a series which  wasn't  At the end though  became que clear that that's what  wasThe  end leaves the series open to lots of suprises  I can't wa to see  what happensThis book is well wth your vestment but will leave you  clamg f the next  I am willg to wager  might be another year  befe my hunger is satisfied
The fourth stallment of Harry Potter's adventures is by far the most comprehensive  terestg of the Harry Potter series to date I thoughly enjoyed readg about Harry's new adventures wh Hermione   Ron durg their fourth year at Hogwarts  Aga JK Rowlg strgs the  reader along wh her 'Usual Suspect' type twists Her subtle hts   allusions allow the reader to clue  on the possible culpr In my own  readgs of her past novels  this one I aga was fooled by a twist of  the plot  I always found myself readg past pages over to make sure I  absbed every msel Even now after completg the book I contue to  re-read certa parts of the book to study the tricate detail of  Rowlg's prowess  I would strongly suggest the Harry Potter series f  anyone lookg f a great book to curl up wh!
There's a good reason f all the fuss over this book!  JK Rowlg's latest book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire delivers exactly what we've come to expect from the well-known Harry Potter series Harry Ron   Hermione are back aga along wh all the people you've come to know   love ( possibly hate) from the first three books  An excellent  sty f all ages Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is next to  impossible to put down once you've begun readg   Wh Voldemt  lurkg yet aga Harry is thrown to a dangerous ter-academy wizardg  competion he didn't enter  In addion to his schoolwk Harry must  contend wh a new threat to his person  animosy comg from me  than the Slythers as he yet aga risks his le f the sake of his  friends  school  In addion to engrossg 's also certaly not  lackg  eher the trademark hum which is plentul  the first three  books  anythg else we've come to expect from the series  Harry Potter  IV is every b as good as the others  me!  In sht this book is a  wonderful addion to the series  a must-have f your library no  matter how old you are
Well once aga Jk Rowlgs has done  Harry Potter IV The Goblet of Fire is by far the best yet The 752 page book is well wth readg Harry Potter on yet another adventure to Hogwarts And faces New Challenges the  whole way There is one thg that I will stressYou really must read  books 1 2  3 (Harry Potter) To really underst  appreciate the  book I am 13 yrs of age  I absolutely love  So does my younger  sister (9)  my parents who I dont thk they would like  I gave there  ages out hehThe book is good f all ages  keeps you wantg to read  whout stop  then all over agasame wh the first 3 books except  this book is even better considerg how long  iswell I hope you get  s my new fave book aside from the first 3  I would recommed  this f everyoneThankyou Jk Rowlg f wrtg !
Ms Rowlg has done  aga  made her latest book better than the last one which was certaly hard to do  The hum that Rowlg has mastered  the other books is still present but the series does seem to  be turng to a me serious side at times  The serious side only adds to  the depth of the books though  I defately recommed this book  Some  parents of younger fans should be warned that the book defately shows how  evil Voldemt can be  should maybe eher read the last six  seven  chapters out loud to their children  at least be close by  This book is  defately wth buyg though I hope everyone has fun wh readg 
In this fourth Harry Potter adventure the reader is aga swept away to the magical wld of Hogwart's school  Now 14 Harry's challenges are becomg me dficult-- me excg  A variety of magical  creatures spells potions  curses pepper the pages of Harry's latest  book As he faces classroom obstacles as well as the dangers posed by  &quotHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named&quot Harry's friends are by his side  Ron Hermione Hagrid  his godfather Sirius are Harry's allies  throughout this thrillg sequel to Harry Potter  the Prisoner of  Azkaban  It will be hard f you to put down as the plot unfolds  this  magical adventure
I have never read a book of this size so quickly! I was absolutely consumed wh  this weekend  Fast paced  tense! The ial episode at the Riddle House moved quickly settg the stage f Ld Voldemt to start his evil deeds (In the other books he was much slower to arrive)  After all he IS the qutessential villian! The Wld Cup Quiddch Match  left me wonderg who the death eaters might be Malfoy certaly was  arrogant as usual Best of all I really like the way Rowlg can keep you  wonderg who the &quotbad guys&quot are The three tasks f the tri-wizard  contest  were credibly ventive But why was help so easily offered?  How did that Skeeter woman always seem to know what was happeng? I never  seemed to second-guess what would happen Some people have cricized this  series but the &quotGoblet of Fire&quot shows  many posive tras  like: teamwk  loyalty (Ron Harry  Hermione)  ethics &amp bravery  (Harry  Cedric) social justice refm (Hermione)  true carg  (Mrs Weasley Harry  Dumbelde  Sirius)  As an adult I loved this  book  Not f the 8 &amp 9 yr olds though Parents should be aware that  there are 3 &quotmild&quot swears a few deaths  some VERY tense  suations here Read  yourself first  decide  your child is ready  -most children over 10 will fd this the BEST BOOK EVER !
J K Rowlg shows that she hasn't burned out yet  this magical sequel to &quotHarry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot  A whoppg 734 pages Harry Potter's fourth year begs wh a bang at the Quiddch Wld  Cup  Hts of an excg year at Hogwarts puzzle Harry  co as the  summer fishes up Mrs Weasley shops f their dress robes  Fred   Gege manufacture their own Zonko's merchise At Hogwarts Profess  Dumblede fms them of a magical competion that will take place that  year between 3 schools -- a competion that has not occurred  well over  a century  Each school has a champion but image Harry's surprise when  he is chosen as the FOURTH compet  Just when you thk the book is  comg to a close an unexpected turn of events shows the path to a dark   excg fth book  Well wth a read I thk J K could have  chopped off 100 pages whout harmg the book though
I received my copy on July 8th  tried to read  slowly but I had to fish  last night (july 10th)!  I believe that this is the best book yet  the Harry Potter series  I am an adult  havg no children yet I  wonder   is a ltle scary f the younger part of the target audience  (9-10)? I thought parts were a ltle creepy!  This book is very dferent  from the first three due to the addion of two fiegn schools of  wizardry which allows the plot not to be &quotcookie cutter&quot when  compared to the first three books Hopefully the addional schools   some of the characters will be present  future books Introducg several  new characters  this book made  very terestg  an &quotanythg  could happen&quot kd of way Throughly enjoyed the book  will now  have to wa f the next one
It's too bad that this review thg will only let you choose 5 as the highest because  deserves at least a 10 This book was the best out of the four so far but 's length made  a ltle harder to follow I have  read books much longer than this one but everythg  this book seemed  kd of hurried compared to the previous three The events  new  characters   are just as igal  creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books I was afraid that Rowlg might  have lost a ltle b of her creativy  somethg but I assure you  this one captured me  pulled me to  just like the other ones The  whole plot  sty le are amazg  you'd never be able to guess what  happens I read the book  less than two days simply because I couldn't  put  down I was fced to keep readg  I even delayed meals to  squeeze  some me readg The entire book was thoughly enjoyed    was better than I expected  to be Many unexpected turns  the book made   me enjoyable Although this book was a ltle b darker  me  mysterious than the first  third ones I still thk  had the most  volved  complicated plot which made  better than the others I am  very glad that I went to the bookste at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book It was extremely good  completely wth readg I hope  I  certaly thk that everyone will agree when I say that JK Rowlg has  caught the snch aga wh another awesome Harry Potter tale
If you liked the first three you will defately like this one It is by far the best  the series so far
Now Harry is back at Hogwarts f his fourth year Wh a new teacher  a big event happeng the book gets good very quickly Harry fally does somethg about his crush on Cho Chang  his wryg about Voldmert may  be true
This book while almost twice as long as the other Harry Potter novels is as good as  better than the previous 3 I devoured  an an eveng (stayg up until 3 am to do so)To be honest  took me que a while  to read the Potter books because I considered them to be children's books -  not what someone like me would want to bother wh readg  I was  however fced to eat my wds  These books appeal to people of all ages   take me back to rememberg a time when everythg was new   wonderful  This particular book Vol 4 of a planned 7 volume series is a  b darker than the previous novels  contas some well extremely  unhappy events  It almost seems that as Harry ages the complexy of the  books creases (of course the complexy of le DOES crease as you get  older)
this book was great rowlg has done another masterpiece!  this book is the best yet  i was constantly suprised  the much talked about death was a shocker  the two new schools volved  this book don't que match up to hogwarts but are very terestg  harry's love le remas an  almost non-issue although hermione  her new smile seem to be wkg  wonders  over all anyone lookg at this review should read the book!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book I haveever read! A must read f both children  adults Harry RonHermione  the rest of Hogwarts School are awag the TriWizard Competion to be held f the first time  a century But wh Ld Voldemt's suppters on the loose anythg can happen JK Rowlg's new novel cludes many old faces from the previous books as well as many excg new characters After you've started readg you won't be able to put  down I can't wa f #5!
The fourth book  the series Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Harry yet Beg 734 pages  seems like  will never end But when you fish readg the last page you won't stop thkg about  the thgs  the book f days The book troduces somethg that  replaces Quiddch at Hogwarts f this particular year  replaces   wh a special event that hasn't happened f a century You'll have to  read the book to fd out what  is :) The Goblet of Fire is exactly what   sounds like except the flames are blue  at times change to red Its  purpose surprised me  as  will probably do to you Although darker   parts than the other books (this book troduces the Unfgivable  Curses-pretty self explanaty what they are) me teen-age at times (  has a ball   (as  dancg ball)) Harry's actions toward Proffes  Trelawney are que funny  a small character from the second book  returns Buy this book  you won't regret !
Goblet of Fire was so far the best stallment  Rowlg's series  The plot was tight  had me guessg until the end The newly troduced charecters were a marvelous treat I read this book  a ltle under 13  hours absbg every wd  detail  My 33 year old bra was taken  back 20 yearsto a place where all thgs were possible  good prevails  My only complat is that the book wasn't enchanted  didn't keep gog   gog  Now I have to wa f year 5  hope as this one proves  they just keep gettg better
Amazgly the Harry Potter books keep gettg better  better!Harry is older  this book  you can tell because the issues dealt wh  this book might be a ltle b scary f the younger readersBut always  as  the pervious books Harry learns an imptant lesson  we learn  me  me about the wld of Wizards
When my mother bought the first Harry P0tter book to read to my younger brother I picked  up  read  first  Sce then I have read each book when  came out excedly  My mother reserved  procured a copy  of &quotHarry P0tter  the Goblet of Fire (Book 4)&quot on the very day   came out -- promisg that I would be the first to read  (as I read  the fastest)  When I had fished everythg else I needed to do I went  out to my family's back yard where my mother had been readg the book  As I picked  up she ran at me screechg  grabbed  right out of  my hs  I fally got a chance to read  on Monday while she was at  wk  JK Rowlg has not dissapoted!  The sty was so captivatg I  barely put  down until I had fished  -- all  one day!  The book  immediately grabs the reader's attention  holds  throughout the entire  book  If I had to make one cricism I would say that the book's most  basic plotle ( you had to pare the p  a few wds) is similar to  those of each of the previous 3 Harry P0tter books  Havg said this I  can a$sure you that everythg else is completely dferent  wonderful  another masterpiece by a gted auth  I look fward to any me Harry  P0tter books!
The long awaed sequel to Harry Potter  the Prisoner foAzkaban is here at last  This book entled Harry Potter  theGobblet of Fire is as  even me climatic  fun-filled as the past three Potter books  JK Rowlg has truely out done herself  this particular book  It displays many twists  turns as do the other Harry Potter books  not me There are also new surprises  new characters addg to the previous ones  I give this book four stars  two thumbs up  This is a book that I will gladly share  truely recommend to children  adults of all ages  I myself wish that JK Rowlg would contue wrg about Harry  his adventures throughout Hogwarts  also  his adult le  This is a very extradary book  I hope that all of you who have read   will read   the future to come will enjoy  as much as I did
JKRowlg has out done herself yet aga! If you have read the other three you are gog to really enjoy this one Rowlg sets up the book so people who have not read the other books can follow along Don't let the  size scare you  flows so nicely you'll not want to put  down! There is  plenty of action new romances  shockg events that will keep you  entertaed A must buy!
The fourth Harry Potter book is fally out!Everyone wanted a copy  Why? Because  is a great book full of trigue mystery  excement  Harry Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts school of wchcraft  wizardy  begs  A very excg anouncement is made  The tri-wizard tournament  will be held at Hogwarts that very year! (Only wches  wizards 17   older will be able to enter though)  But all is not well  the school  once they pick the contestents because a shockg surprise pops up  A le  of surprises follow  Harry  his friends are led to a evil mystery  that lks together wh clues from the begg of the book  Harry has so  much to wry about not to mention the upcomg Yule Ball  (Which girl  will he ask?)  He certaly isn't prepared f what's  ste at the end  of the tri-wizard tournement!  I won't spoil the end  You'll have to read  the book  But i'll tell you this  you liked the other 3 books you'll  defely like this one!  It is wth all 734 pages  I know 's long  but I fished   two daysThat's how good  is!  Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire is a really great addion to the series  You absoulutely  HAVE to read   If you haven't already read the other three books   JK Rowlgs excg series!
Grippg action packed lots of villians lots of heros new magical creatures new spells twists  turns  most of all LOTS OF FUN!  Started readg  at 9 PM Sunday night  fished  at 3:30 AM (Good  thg I'm the mommy!) Rowlg has created a delightful wld full of  extremely well-developed characters  a spell-bdg plot I thk that  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is the best &quotHarry Potter&quot so far I  just wish Rowlg could wre as fast as I read Hats off to Harry!
My ne year old will state unequivocally that JK Rowlg taught him how to read  my twelve year old started readg the book Saturday night  was fished readg  late Sunday afternoon  The new addion to the  series is everythg a kid  a mother who reads selected chapters out  loud could hope f  The plot is as excg as we've come to expect   there is enough satire  wd play to enterta the most discrimatg   lerary adult  The fears that this book is darker  deals wh me  mature themes like girlfriends  death are largely unfounded  After all  Harry is an phan  the addional death  this book is treated que  well  The girfriend thg is no me than a mild crush  Here's to Book 5
This book is excellent It has all of the characteristics of a harry potter book while addg some new twists The book is so enticg that I could not put  down
Make no mistake this book is bigger darker  yes better than the previous three (although I love each one f dferent reasons) Any HP fan knows that JK Rowlg would have to take HP to another level  der to  improve upon the credible first three books Well she's done  We're  brought closer to Voldemt we learn me about the histy of all the  characters  Harry Ron  Hermione's friendship is tested And all of  them are growg up tooYes 's darker but don't be daunted by that  n by the size of the book Remember that Harry is growg up   makes  sense that he's ready  able to tackle harder problems at 14 than he was  at 11 It's still an credible book!Sigh The only problem wh this  book is that I've already fished   I don't know when the next one's  comg out! I thought I was hooked on the HP series befe this one came  out but now I'm dyg to know what happens next! I thk the only thg to  do is to reread &quotScerer's Stone&quot  keep gog from there
I adm  I am an adult  yet I spent the better part of the last two days stealg time to read [ yes fish ( isn't sht)]this book Harry Potter is not the wld's greatest wizard- JK Rowlg is Only  magic can expla her abily to deliver a book as satisfyg as  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  the face the enmous  pressure hype  expectations that built up to  No mere mtal could  have pulled  off   Though HPatGoF starts somewhat slowly wh a  prologue  quickly regas momentum wh a return vis wh the Weasleys  followed by the Quiddch Wld Cup between Irel  Bulgaria Rowlg's  trademark imagative touches are everywhere: team col badges that scream  the players' names flags that play their national anthems when waved   action figures that are really active  After that we're back to the fourth  year at Hogwarts where Harry is chosen as s representative  the  Triwizard Tournament agast rival schools Durmstrang  Beaux-batons  Of  course the threat of Voldemt shrouds the proceedgs leadg up to a  thrillg w duel that will not disappot even the most avid Rob Hood  Star Wars  Three Musketeers fans Sadly there is also the death of a  beloved character (JK warned us) that somehow seems oddly ftg   &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is a wthy success to  the three books that came befe   It entertas  structs   a  wld where real-le heroes are often less than heroic  provides role  models f kids of all ages I eagerly awa book five
Hopefully the Harry Potter craze is the begng of a new trend of YA entertament that doesn't condescend to young adults  assume they are less sophisticated than they actually are which is what American entertament aimed at that demographic all too often does / assumes  At any rate 's thrillg to see young people so exced about a book  rather than the new N'Sync  Brney Spears album  Cheers to Harry  Potter!
I liked the first three but Rowlg really needs to come up wh me igal  terestg stuff  While the volume of the sty made f a deeper plot the book dragged on at times  I thought the endg could've  been better
This the fourth volume of Ms Rowlgs Harry Potter series is an excellent read I am 20 years old  would never have thought of readg a &quotchildrens book&quot  my sister had not waved the first volume   front of my face  told me  was wth a look So skeptically i picked   up  was pulled to a wld i have hardly ever been pulled to by a  book The sty was truly immersive After fishg the first i had to  read the second  third They only got better as the series went on This  series of books is truly f all age groups though some children might need  help wh the references/language that the books conta When the fourth  stallment came out i knew i had to buy  I read   the day that  followed  wish even now that i hadn't fished  so quickly Wag  f the next one will be an excrutiatg task f I must know what happens  next The Goblet of Fire is a pivotal book  the series It outles the  plot that will start to happen from now on Rowlgs Potter series is  truely captivatg They appeal to the ner child of us all  exp our  imagations I defely recommend this tle to anyone who is lerate  Now to wa the 11 months till the next book  the series comes out It  will be a long wa might as well read the series over aga =)
In this excg new adventure Harry  his friends Hermione  Ron are  their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizzardry They are once aga solvg a mystery that could mean le  death  In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Harry fds himself battlg heartbreak  friendship  tough suations  To make matters wse Ra Skeeter a  Daily Prophet repter is wrg false fo about Harry  his friends   I thoughly enjoyed this book  would recommend  to anyone who loves a  funny thrillg novel that you are unable to put down!
Harry Potters 4th book  the series is the greatset yet In the book Harry gets ved to the Quiddch Wld Cup Will the Dursley's let him go? Has Ld Voldemt come back like  his dreams? Also Harry's school  Hogwarts is havg an event that hasn't happened  over one hundred  years  after that every five years the Triwizard Tournament But the  mistry of magic has come up wh a new rule That only people older than  17 can jo  Harry is only 14 Will Harry be able to bend the rules   jo  the tournament  will he never jo  on this  once--a-le-time opptuny?
I started readg this book on Saturday  came  to wk bleary-eyed on Monday because I just couldn't put  down--- I'm already anxious to get to number 5  The sty is both engrossg  amusg This book is me  complex  suspenseful than the earlier ones the auth seems to trust  that her child readers are maturg along wh Harry  his friends  She  troduces some entertag new characters such as the delightfully  detestable Ra Skeeter  the wizard Mad-Eye while contug to develop  Harry Hermione Ron  the rest of the familiar cast  I consider these  books to be the equivalent of the Oz series  the Chronicles of Narnia  I  highly recommend this tle not only to the children f whom 's wrten  but to adults like me as well!
Fans of JK Rowlg's previous Harry Potter books should enjoy this fourth stallment  the series  All of the old characters return  we contue to learn me about them  watch them grow  In a similar way  we learn me about the magical wld self  Ms Rowlg troduces  histies  spells which f seamlessly wh past books meanwhile  settg the stage f this  future adventures  The book is fun  ventive  surprisg wh adventures  plot twists capable of  entertag adults as well as childrenDespe the fact that this is by  far the longest Harry Potter book  is the least st-alone of the four  Rudimentary explanations are made f some -- possibly most -- references  to past books but a new reader to the series would nonetheless have a hard  time understg what was gog on  This problem is largely a  side-effect of Ms Rowlg's rich use of personaly human teraction   wld-creation  Sce her characters  plots grow from book to book  jog the series  the middle becomes like enterg a conversation  between siblgs  There is too much histy between them to be able to  expla everythg whout cripplg their own conversation  The easy  solution to this problem: read this book only after you've read the  previous threeMe of a disappotment though is that the endg may  as well have &quotTO BE CONTINUED&quot  blazg letters  Fahful  readers will recall that there are generally several terrelated plot  les runng through each Harry Potter sty  In this book the struggle  to ga the goblet of fire is practically the only plot le that reaches a  conclusion  It is not even the ma plot  Several relationship subplots  also are troduced  this book but not addressed  A reader will eher  miss them completely  have to acknowledge that the ongog references  are mere feshadowg f a future bookSo &quotHarry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire&quot doesn't st alone So what?  I've read the first  three  I plan to read as many future Harry Potter books as Ms Rowlg  will wre  This is a great series  I highly recommend all four of the  books now  prtire&quot doesn't st alone So what?  I've read the first  three  I plan to read as many future Harry Potter books as Ms Rowlg  will wre  This is a great series  I highly recommend all four of the  books now  prt
Of course I was one of many eagerly anticipatg the fourth book  this series  of course I wasn't disappoted I don't wish to spoil anythg f the reader so I won't go to terric deatil about what  happens  the book but I will say that what takes place  the book is  just as thrillg  not me so than  any of the preceedg books  Rowlg has masterfully blended children's lerature wh adult  lerature  this &quotadult&quot reader is very satisfied wh the  result Aga the endg is a complete surprise even to this fan who  tries to chart her way through the book  deduce the endg The new  characters are a delightful addion to the cast  the returng  characters are displayed  even fer gly I would defely recommend  this book to any reader of any age There is ltle me you could ask  f except an earlier release date f the fth book I look fward to  readg  a second time this week
The content  wrg is just awesome The book is so bulky you need a Lazyboy to be able to s  read comftably  Highly recommended Ht: read the first 3 books first
IF you thought the previous Harry Potter books were good wa until you read this one!  Harry is aga  danger  this book has everythg suspense mystery action  all of those other great thgs  Plus the  book is a lot longer so 's full of a lot me  You'll have fun wh  this one!
JK Rowlg auth of the number one book series wld-wide has done  aga  Harry Poter  The Goblet of Fire was wrten excellent  smashed all the sales recds  Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire is a  must-read  All though I'm only eleven  I started  the saturday July 8th   fished  on July 10th  Harry's action filled adventures are  dangerous as he tries to stay alive  Triwizard Tournament  The plot is  great  old characters are new once aga now that this fabulous book is  out  Keep an eye out f this excellent book!

Harry arrives at school to fd thgs a b dferent then when he left  last year  This year Hogwarts is hostg the Tri wizard championship which has been  canceled f some time now  Other wizardg schools are troduced as  they play an imptant roll  the championship  Harry is faced wh far  me ternal  external challenges than ever befe And the endg  defatly came as a b of a shock  It defatly leaves you hangg  I  can'y believe I have to wa another year f the next Harry Potter  stallment! although I thk 's gog to be extremely dficult to out  do this but I thk I said that last time
HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is an odd mixture of excellence  wdess It does not disappot  the action packed sequences of the Quiddch Wld Cup  s aftermath the three tasks of the Tri-Wizard  tournament  Harry's evable meetg wh Ld Voldemt However   is also packed wh such lengthy explanations that I thought I had  mistakenly picked up HOGWARTS A HISTORY This technique of Rowlg  designed to give the reader as much background fmation as needed  became noticable at the end of the third book as Sirius Black  Remus  Lup explaed their relationship wh James Potter  Peter Pettigrew  These ptions of the book do not wk nearly as well as when Rowlg shows  us what happenedLd Voldemt the depth of whose evil  reach was  only hted on  previous volumes is established though not seen  the  first chapter  the flashbacks  results of his reign of terr which  are revealed throughout the book make him one of the most terryg  characters  children's lerature that I've met I feel cold when readg  about him  his followersOur fave familiar characters Harry  Ron Hermoe the Weasleys  their friends  teachers are all becomg  me real wh each book Their development is natural much like gettg  familiar wh them as wh people  our lives Newly troduced  characters however are a ltle harder to deal wh So many were  troduced  this book  my perception of each of them was jerked  around so much that I began to feel as paranoid as Mad-Eye Moody who had  good reason to feel paranoidHarry  Hermoe are especially well  developed  this book Harry grows through his trials  the Tri-Wizard  Tournament recognizg his limations  character faults which paves  the way to conquerg them Hermoe's transfmation to the beautul  swan was satisfyg  's nice seeg her change from a bray  know--all to a complete person but her development of a &quotsocial  conscience&quot got a ltle tirg after a while  I'm not sure what  parallels  any she tends f children to draw from Characters  that would be welcomed back  future volumes clude Mad-Eye Moody Vict  Crum  Remus Lup (from Book 3) I'm also very terested  the future  of the Weasley Tws because as Harry says  the days ahead a good  laugh will be what everyone needsWe read  listened to this as a  family havg been eagerly awag s release The concensus from our  boys (ages 8  11) is that while  starts a b slowly once  took  off  held their terest They loved One wd about the audio  tape Jim Dale is good sometimes too good One of the flashbacks is  particularly unsettlg  once Harry meets Ld Voldemt  is  impossible to fd a stoppg pot befe the conclusion of the book If  your children are younger  sensive to violence  evil preview the  book  tapeLynne Hobbs Parent  School Librariano a complete person but her development of a &quotsocial  conscience&quot got a ltle tirg after a while  I'm not sure what  parallels  any she tends f children to draw from Characters  that would be welcomed back  future volumes clude Mad-Eye Moody Vict  Crum  Remus Lup (from Book 3) I'm also very terested  the future  of the Weasley Tws because as Harry says  the days ahead a good  laugh will be what everyone needsWe read  listened to this as a  family havg been eagerly awag s release The concensus from our  boys (ages 8  11) is that while  starts a b slowly once  took  off  held their terest They loved One wd about the audio  tape Jim Dale is good sometimes too good One of the flashbacks is  particularly unsettlg  once Harry meets Ld Voldemt  is  impossible to fd a stoppg pot befe the conclusion of the book If  your children are younger  sensive to violence  evil preview the  book  tapeLynne Hobbs Parent  School Librarian
In the fourth book of the Harry Potter Saga everythg is surprisg Harry Potter is startg his fourth year at Hogwarts  many strange thgs happen But the followers of Voldemt are risg wh danger  everywhereThis is a perfect f Harry Potter fans but don't make this  your first book to read  you haven't read the other three
Harry Potter is back  is me terestg than ever  The older he gets the less I feel guilty about readg a &quotchildren's&quot book  My fave character by far is &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody  What an amazg  addion to the cast of characters  There is love danger action  everythg a muggle could want  a book  The much publicized death is  upsettg but  goes wh the flow of the sty  I was pleased wh the  length of the book because I didn't read  all  one night  It meant two  night of revelg  Harry Potter's adventures
My seven-year old daughter  I had July 8 marked on our calendars f the longest time  Hats off to JK Rowlg f the best Harry Potter  It was wth the wa  This book is perhaps a ltle harder to read f  younger readers  My seven-year old is on Chapter Ne but has asked me to  read the rest of the book out-loud to her (She had no problems readg the  others on her own) I also thought that this book was scarier than the  first three so  might be a good idea overall to read this book to a  young reader  The Durselys only show up f a brief period but 's a  very gratyg chapter  the book  The book as usual has Harry up  agast &quotYou-know-who&quot although this time the reader is made  aware of this from the begng  Harry's godfather Sirius Black is also  back as promised  Overall I really enjoyed the book  look fward to  readg  aga once my daughter fishes   My only negative comment  would be about the speakg style of the house-elves  It was tolerable   sht doses but gets irratg after a while  It also seems sensive  to Afro-Americans  The sty of book 5 is fleshed out  the last few  chapters  When do we get that one?  Can't wa
Like the previous Harry Potter books the style clude tons of plot twist  unexpected surprises  In this book we fd out me about the events leadg after the ial defeat of You-Know-Who  also cluded  two maj magical events: Quiddch Wld Cup  Triwizard Tournament  However the style is a lot me sister than the previous Potter  books There are parts that remds me of the events after WWII I don't  thk  is suable f young children I am also a ltle b  disappoted wh one of the sub-plot volved wh Granger who seems to  argue potlessly at the begng of the novel about the elf-slavery That  particular subplot did not go anywhere  was later drop by the auth
  WOW  I just fished readg this book wh my daughter  we out loud f over three days  my voice is startg to go  We just couldn't stop  The hum the suspense the plot twists the mystery  the many  clues the many surprises make this the Best Harry Potter so far  All  our fave characters were back  they are all gettg older as is  the theme I would recommend that you wa until at least 10 years old to  read this  It is que volved  very scary at some pots  And one  character does die  The sty made us laugh  cry sometime wh  mutes  We tried to guess who was guilty  nocent what could happen  next what dferent clues meant  sometimes we were crect frequently  we were very surprised sometimes even stunned but always wanted me  It's a shame  was only 734 pages we would have loved me Of course we  will all read  at least once me like the previous three books the  many plot twist  clues could not all be caught  just one readgWe  can't wa f Harry Potter number 5
I bought the first Harry Potter book f my young son (then 11 years old)  we both got hooked on the series I found that this 4th book met the high stard of the others -- perhaps even surpassed them  some ways  Rowlg departs from the structure she used  the first three by begng  this one wh a Quiddch match (a Wld Cup)   many other ways  throughout this book which is deed as she has told us darker than the  other ones  terms of what happens by the end  But not so dark that  is  unsuable f children  any way  my opion  Perhaps very young  children couldn't hle  (aged under 7  so) but  you would read your  child a Grimm's fairy tale you could read this to them  The book  however wks on other levels besides fairy tale  would be terestg  to adults  Whout givg any of the plot away I can say that the  descriptions  this book of le under Voldemt will strike anyone as  psychologically true  they are familiar wh le under the various  police states  the 20th century  Rowlg makes a powerful plea f  tolerance as she cludes many characters from countries other than Engl   this book  However the book doesn't become heavy at all -- her sense  of hum is marvelously tact as are all the ltle magical details that  make the series so special rankg  my opion wh the other great  fantasies of the twentieth century -- Tolkien Lewis Lloyd Alexer   The Never-endg Sty
Harry Potters 4th book  the series is the greatset yet In the book Harry gets ved to the Quiddch Wld Cup Will the Dursley's let him go? Has Ld Voldemt come back like  his dreams? Also Harry's school  Hogwarts is havg an event that hasn't happened  over one hundred  years  after that every five years the Triwizard Tournament But the  mistry of magic has come up wh a new rule That only people older than  17 can jo  Harry is only 14 Will Harry be able to bend the rules   jo  the tournament  will he never jo  on this  once--a-le-time opptuny?
JK Rowlg describes &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot as the 'central book pivotal  every sense' (see the London Times onle special)  she is right  After the first three books which gave us a  taste of the evil fces that Harry faces here we see them truly  action   they are as terryg  dreadful as we thought they could be  While  bad thgs happened  the earlier books &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is the  pot of no return: Voldemt  his allies must be dealt whAt the  same time Harry  his friends still enjoy the Quiddch Wld Cup   behave like any kids at their first dance (like a lot of us Harry is  awkward  uncomftable!)  Yet he is fced to grow up faster than he'd  like he gets some terestg career advice but his fate - to battle  Voldemt - may close  on him befe he gets to act on We see the  truth of Dumblede's statement  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot that 's not  who you're bn but what you become that counts  Harry  becomg  himself is as endearg as he is enthrallg
The latest long-awaed Harry Potter is almost a fully satisfyg read  Every fave cast member is back: Harry Ron  the Weasleys Hermione Dumblede Hagrid the villanous Snape along wh Malfoy  his Slyther cronies  Dobby rejos the troupe along wh Wky a new  house-elf Less appealg than Dobby this melancholy pixy gives Hermione  fuel f her crusade to liberate house-elves a nice b of comic relief   this darkest of the Potter novels  JK Rowlgs is total master of the  psychology of her characters as well as of her readers  From the begng  of the book stress ( suspense) build to a climax are resolved   after we've all had a breather the next adventure is upon us  the pages  must keep on turng faster  Nuances are revealed  the old familiar  characters (Hagrid wh a love terest!) Me than  the first three  there is violence death  evil  this fourth sty  But I would not  steer young children away from  because this wld is also full of evil  happengs  The sister actions of the villas only play up the basic  goodness courage  selflessness of Harry  his friends  To  appreciate this book the reader should really beg wh the first  the  series  The macabre events  the Chapter One of Goblet of Fire make sense   you've already been troduced to the villa  And there is a wonderful  development of personaly  character  the prcipals over the course  of the four books  This book begs wh a ghastly happeng  when   concludes there has been an credible amount of plottg  mayhem  much of which goes unresolved  I wanted to turn the page when the last  chapter concluded  keep on readg  So many questions are hangg there  f the next volume that could not have been answered  those 734 pages  I am an adult reader (age 61) of this book who reads a great deal  mostly nonfiction  I like the Harry Potter books very much because the  action is entirely igal the plots are perfect the characters  beautully drawn the proper names sheer genius the funny suations  hilarious the dialog fely tuned the timg  pace breathtakg   the psychology the wk of a virtuoso  I shall keep rereadg until  Harry Potter V makes s debutis entirely igal the plots are perfect the characters  beautully drawn the proper names sheer genius the funny suations  hilarious the dialog fely tuned the timg  pace breathtakg   the psychology the wk of a virtuoso  I shall keep rereadg until  Harry Potter V makes s debut
Seven-hundred  thirty-four pages    many people would thk twice about pickg up any book of this length off s shelf  This however is not just any book  This is the fourth stallment to the Harry Potter  series  &quotThe villagers of Ltle Hangleton still called  &quotthe  Riddle House&quot even though  had been many years sce the Riddle  family had lived there   &quot  The precedg was the first le from  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the most recent addion to the  series  This first le draws you  callg you back to the wld of  wizards house-elves muggles  magic     Startg first where we  stopped at the end of Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban we fd  Harry stayg wh his sufferable relatives the Dursleys  One night he  has a nightmare  wakes up wh searg pa stemmg from his lightng  bolt scar  This is just a begng to what he must endure throughout the  school year at Hogwarts   Befe the summer is over Harry does manage to  escape the Dursleys when Ron Weasley ves him to the Quiddch Wld Cup  (which is hosted by Bra this year)  It was all fun  games until  trouble arose a huge sign was conjured  the sky frighteng many   causg questions over the whereabouts of he-who-must-not-be-named   Once  Harry Ron  Hermione reach Hogwarts  attend the Welcomg Ceremony  they are unhappy to fd (along wh their fellow students) that Quiddch  will not be played this year  Instead an even greater event is takg  place: the Triwizard Tournament!

Harry is an excellent book f young adult readers  young-at-heart adult readers The adventure is somethg every kid dreams about It brgs back the memy of the adventures the young-at-heart used to dream about   make us believe aga It has everythg a book is supposed to have   a language that is easy  enjoyable f all Aside from tryg to learn  what muggles are  the occasional monster that Hagrid loves so much  There is a plot a begng middle  end Each book is separate sty   they all lk to one another It helps young readers to build their  imagation  to exp our dwdlg ones (young-at-hearts) I  personally read books f pleasure  research And I have added the  Harry Potter's to my list I look fward to the time when I have children   my nephews are old enough f me to read to them  Young readers enjoy   because they can relate  are at an age that they can still dream  about exp their dreams to clude themselves as Harry's friends   counter-parts  his achievements F the young-at-heart he brgs us  back to our childhood  our imagation And allows us relief from the  route  mundane of our wld He brgs laughter  mischief to  everyone he touches (Except Snape  the Slythers   He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named)  That is why I enjoyed readg Harry look  fward to his next books  adventures  give him 5 stars
Even though I am 26 years old I read the first 3 books  4 days  I thk the first 3 books have the same sty structure therefe  gets old  However the 4th one (Goblet of Fire) tops all the other books  It  defately is a must read f all the &quotMuggles! &quot
Some of my favoure auths are Ge Vidal John Irvg  Tom Wolf I must adm however to havg a serious soft spot f JKRowlgs Harry Potter sties  her latest The Goblet of Fire is no exceptionThis the fourth  her series of apparently seven books is twice the  size of Harry's previous outgs  begs wh the wonderfully teasg  setup of the Riddle House brgg  wh  the return of you-know-who  through the Quiddch Wld Cup the return to Hogwarts (you'll  have to read  to fd out me ! ) As wh all the HP books  pays to  read the earler parts carefully as clues abound  everythg (well  almost everythg)  is beautully tidied up by the endI began  readg the book wryg that JK might not be able to mata the  ventiveness the cleverness  the carefull plottg of the previous  books I should not have wried as  many ways this one is the best so  farMaybe younger people enjoy these books f their sense of adventure   I get that too but as an adult this is pure soul food
As wh the previous three Harry Potter books I bought this book f my eight year old son to enjoy  Also like the previous three I found myself captivated by the wrgs of JK RowlgThe fourth book lives up to  the rest wh 's excg descriptions  plot twists  Meover the  book does seem to drag a b at the begng  Harry  Hermione Granger  (one of Harry's best friends at Hogwart's) are ved to attend the  Quiddch Wld Cup wh the Weasley family  Ron Weasley beg Harry's  other best friend at Hogwart's  There are some humous suations as the  auth descibes the attire wn by various wches  wizards who are  tryg to resemble muggles (non-magical people)  The Quiddch match  self is not as excg as those played by Harry  his team agast  other houses at Hogwart's  Possibly because the reader has not been able  to develop an understg of the Wld Cup players as thoughly as the  players at Hogwart'sChapter twelve was when I was fally able to feel  some familiary wh the previous books  It is  this chapter that Harry  returns to Hogwart's School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  The arrival of  the students at school mimic the same details as befe wh the exception  of the cancellg of Quiddch games  fav of the Triwizard Tournament  An event which has not taken place  over a hundred years  F this  tournament representatives from two other schools of wchcraft will  descend upon the school as they compete to w  Although there is suppose  to be only one champion from each school  Harry's name is somehow  regurgated by the Goblet of Fire as a participant  This leads to three  tasks that the players must compete at  All the descriptions of the tasks  are rivetg  the reader will fd themself turng the pages  frantically to fd out what will happen next  It is durg these three  tasks that the unftunate death of a key person takes place castg a dark  feel f the rest of the bookThe end of the book does not leave the  reader wh the same feelgs as the previous three but rather a b  detached  The auth has left many sty les open to address  the  followg stallments which of course will have the reader greatly  anticipatg the arrival of those booksAll  all the book was a  fantastic read provg that JK Rowlg is a true master of fictionf the rest of the bookThe end of the book does not leave the  reader wh the same feelgs as the previous three but rather a b  detached  The auth has left many sty les open to address  the  followg stallments which of course will have the reader greatly  anticipatg the arrival of those booksAll  all the book was a  fantastic read provg that JK Rowlg is a true master of fiction
Of the 4 Harry Potter books this one is the longest but at the same time  is even me captivatg than the first 3  Once you start readg you will not want to put the book down  I read the book  less that 24  hours!  Yes 24 hours!  To be honest f fans of the first 3 books  there are places where the sty does slow  But that is because we already  know that Harry is a wizard  lives wh Muggles  We are already  familiar wh Harry his friends his enemies  Hogwarts  But f new  readers they need to know this fmation  Although I would hope that  new readers to the series start wh Book 1As an adult who has lost  count of the books I have read I am fdg all of the Harry Potter books  to be entertag  I wish they were available back when I was a child  Maybe I would have read even me  Well they would have been added to all  of the others that I read like &quotThe Hobb&quot  &quotThe Lion  the Wch  the Wardrobe&quotWill I reread the book?  Yes I  already have plans to take  wh me to the beach to reread  a few  weeks  I am lookg fward to rereadg about Fred  Gege's antics   about Fawkes the phoenix  And yes readg about Harry's learng  experiences aga
Year Four at Hogwarts has some big changes  ste f Harry Potter He is becomg attracted to girls  so is Ron Weasley But a lot me changes too We start out wh the thrillg  wild Quiddch Wld Cup  followed by some rather nasty crowd violence that leads straight to the  begng of this year's adventureFeign students show up at Hogwarts   lead many people's hearts  mds astray But over everythg lies  the gloomy prediction of the Divation Profess at the end of book 3  &quotLd Voldemt will rise aga - stronger than befe&quotThe  full cast of characters returns  this book wh repeat perfmances from  the stard cast of characters: the Dursleys Malfoy Crabbea nd Goyle  Snape McGonagal Dumblede the Weasleys Hermione (  IS pronounced  Her-My-Oh-nee)  Hagrid But we also get return viss from Sirius Black  Cnelius Fudge House Elf Dobby  othersThe year at Hogwarts flies  by even faster than befe  Harry's ftunes  moods swg back   fth like a pendulum as the dramatic action unfoldsOne warng Do NOT  start wh this book  then go back to the others You'll miss too much  Start at one  go from there
Harry Potter has seen the Quiddch Wld Cup  is  a special contest We have returns of some old friends  old enemies Will Harry survive the fourth year? Read  fd out (reviewed by a seventh grader)
THE BOOK WAS GREATAS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THE FIRSTTHREE YOULL LOVE IT!  CAN'T WAIT FOR #5
I just fished the book  I thought  was great You will want to have read the other three first otherwise you may not catch all that is happengI enjoyed the twists  turns as usual
I got this book on Sunday  I loved  alot It is the best book so far  the Harry Potter Series I fished   8  a half hours It was so good that my mom had to drag me out of my bed I suggest  you are gog  to read this book you better do the thgs you planed to do befe you read  the book I also suggest you fd a nice comftable spot to read I  I guess the ma sty starts when Albus Dumblede announced about  the Triwizard Contest which 3 dferent schools compete wh each other  Each person who is 17  older could enter the contest all you have to do  is put your name  the school name to the Goblet of Fire   will  choose a champion from each school F the safety of the people Dumblede  put an under age spell so that no one can enter who is of under age In the  contest you will fd all sts of dangers which needs alot of darg   courage But you also get rewarded f the Contest  you w 1000  galleons Thats the big catch when someone enters Harry's name  the  Goblet of Fire the whole school was astonished when the Goblet of Fire  picked 2 people from Hogwarts That's when the sty takes an odd twist  Harry faces all sts of dangers which needs alot of courage  darg  What's wse is that Ron is jealous  angry  thks that Harry has  entered the contest just to get some attention This book has alot of  surprises  I love the way  ends The endg is so shockg that f a  moment I could not believe  This sty has a very nice twist  I  reccomend you to read  I can bet you anythg that you will like   Another peice of advice: Have some snacks around beacause you will not be  gettg up very soon! I wish I could tell you me but  I do  would  totally spoil the sty  Like the review?  Consider readg this  book This book deserves me than five stars Now I wonder when the fth  book will be comg !  Good Luck to you  trust me please use my  suggestions Have a nice timeions Have a nice time
Rowlg sces aga wh the same charm hum  magic that delighted readers  the first three books The excement  anxiety build throughout the book makg  very dficult to put down I greedily  fished the book  just one dayI appreciate a book that makes me  laugh outloud - but who can help laughg wh someone like Dobby the  house-elf around This is the most enjoyable children's series I have  read ( I have read que a few) Even at 700+ pages I wish the book had  been longer I am already dreadg the seventh book's arrival because I  will miss Harry  his friends
Unlike the overpublicized prequel to Lucas' Star Wars movies Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire lives up to s billg The fourth stallment  J Rowlg's series about an phaned boy who discovers that he is someone  special  a wld beyond imagation Goblet of Fire has already shattered  sales recdsIs  wth ?You bet! Rowlg is a masterful wrer  Her characters are realistic yet quirky enough to be memable  her  plots are tricate but not so complicated that younger readers won't be  able to follow them Clues to the surprisg fal outcome are scattered  throughout the book  the sty ends wh a wonderful sense of closure  while at the same time leavg a few signicant plot threads danglg  htg at what's to come  the next bookMy personal fave moments  are usually provided by the Weasley family Nearly all readers will be able  to relate closely to them They seem so nmal - what kid hasn't had her  mother yell at her f leavg her toys around? And yet the magical wld  is such a part of their lives that  gives their nmalcy an offbeat  flavParents who are wried about the tone of this book can rest a  b easier Yes a maj character does die However Rowlg does not  delve to spectacular ge  violence Instead  is hled  realistically  compassionately It is an excellent way to troduce to  children the idea that sometimes bad thgs happen to nice peopleThe  only bugaboo I had wh this book was that the  Hermione Granger subplot  was not adequately resolved It might be carried over to the next book  though so I'll just have to wa  see how  endsOverall: GO OUT  AND GET THIS BOOK!
I believe that Rowlg has created yet another astoundg style f children as well as adults  although I feel that some of the scenes wh Voldemt need not be so graphic as to scare the ws out of children  the age groups You have outled as readers I  as an adult however  enjoyed the sequel thoughly   did not put the book down until I had  fished all 732 pages!  I  liked the way that Rowlg employed new tactics to thrill her readers  her abily to make us FEEL what was happeng to all of her characters   new  oldthis is what kept me glued to the book  I cried out at the  sheer misery of the last few chapters Bravo Rowlg !  I can't wa f the next  one!
I have read all four Harry Potter books  I have to say that this one is the best of all  The plot gets really complicated  I was fooled by several of the characters Rowlg has  the book  Just as the rums  dicated there is darkness   death  this book but none of  is  there f show  Every character every cident  the plot every  description  of scenery are imptant to the plot  It was good to see  all the faves from the first three books  this one too  Sirius  Black Hermione Granger the Weasley clan  even the nasty Slythers  are here  Rowlg does a great job of contug to develop their  characters  The creasg strength of Voldemt adds the expected  sister tone to the book  the Weasley tws balance the scary scenes  wh hilarious ones  Their busess enterprises are very appropriate   add comic relief to the novel  Certaly no reader will fget the  Quiddch Wld Cup the Goblet of Fire scene  the Triwizard Tournament  Once aga Rowlg has created a vivid fantasy wld re wh magical  spells  the classic showdowns between good  evil  This book will  only make readers want to read me!
I truly loved this book I did not start readg these books until the third one came out This one keeps you readg late to the night There are so many adventures from one chapter to the next that I could not put  the book down!
Great book  great wa great endg great just great
This is the BEST Harry Potter book yet!  I had  delivered on the 8th  I was readg  every chance I could get!  It is so suspenseful   had my undivided attention from the start  I love the way Rowlg decribed  every event so completely that you never had any question as to what was  gog on! This book is by far  above the most adventurous  I can't  wa to read  aga!  Rowlg had me turng the pages  I felt as  I  was experiencg the amazg adventures wh Harry  his friends There  is nothg dary about this book!
Well much to nobodies surprise JK Rowlg pulls off another great Harry Potter book  In fact they just keep gettg better  This year Hogwarts dches the Quidch matches  ves two other magical schools over f the long suspended (because of too many deaths) Triwizard Tournament  Meanwhile Profess Trilaey was right  book 3 the servant has  escaped to his master mwahahahaerr MWAHAHAHA
JK Rowlg is at her best! The book was great Some characters from previous books make a return  the fourth book Harry also viss the Quiddch Wld Cup Burlgaria vs Irel  You will learn about dferent magic schools Even though there were no  Quiddch matches there were the Triwizard Tournament agast the dferent  schools I thought  was a great book becasue  showed a lot  detail    fun to see old characters  learn about the dferent schools Jk  Rowlg has vented a whole lot of new characters   was a good book  Retellg of Quiddicth matches  Hogwarts I hope you enjoy Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire as much as I did
First of all i'd like to say that im a 15 year old boy  i like Harry Potter Im not ashamed to say  to anyone im proud of  I decided to buy Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the day  came out I had never read a Harry Potter book befe  i was a b skeptical i thought they  were like some long cheezy versions of the goosebumps books i bought when  i was younger  I wasnt even thkg of buyg but  just called to  me  the Virg Megaste  NYC where i was lookg at the cds  DVDs  And  was on sale so i thoughtwhat the heck?  I love books  i read  all kds So i bought the book  I was so anxious to read  i hardly  slept that night I got up early the next mng  opened  up    seemed like i didnt put  down after that The pages just flew by until i  fished a few hours ago The sty was just so smooth  good  easy to  read  was like watchg a tv show  I thought i would be lost cause i  never read any of the other books but f the most part the book  explaed everythg I thk i liked the book so much because i could  identy wh Harry Beg only a year older i could underst alot of  thgs such as his nervousness about the competion  about the dance  The whole dance thg was wrten very well showg not a fairy tale happy  endg but a sadder endg which many teens can relate to Overall   was a fun sty  a joy to read  ill also be gog out  buyg the  other three books  Consider me a converted man
I just fished readg the fourth Harry Potter book  loved   Once aga someone is out to get Harry  the You-Know-Who seems to be gettg stronger  The novel has a well developed plot terestg  igal  events  even a surprise endg  Like the other novels  the series  this book is a suspenseful mystery  I highly recommend  to anyone who  has enjoyed the other Harry Potter books
What can i sayfally i read   one wd WOW! I could not put  down not gonna reveal too much of the plot but  is essential to read the previous novels of the series to underst  All I am gonna say is the  endg will take your breath away  And f the first time i was really sad  to see my last chapter  Though  will live up to your expectation you'll  be anticipatg the next book The one thg i wanna know now is how long  do we have to wa f Harry Potter V?
As all the other Harry Potter books do this one keeps you on your seat This is best far the first book series I will tell my childreen  how  had me beggg f me I became part of the book  was put  a wld  of fantesy  magic This book was no dferent then the others It had  all of what the other books had to offer  me!

When I first saw how bulky the book was I had serious doubts as to whether  would be able to live up to the expectations I had built up f  sce readg the last Harry Potter book I was NOT disappoted I  bought the book Saturday eveng picked  up  started readg   couldn't put  down until I fished  24 hours later Yes  was THAT  good! I would HIGHLY recommend readg this -- even though I thought the  first half of the book dragged on f a b the last half me than made  up f   excement  unexpected surprises This is truly the pivotal  book of the series  defely not to be missed  you've already read  the first three  this series
s cool how the potter books keep on gett better  better huh? IM not gog to give u the plot because s better to fd  out yourself trust me on this one! so i will overview the book generally  this novel is me  chillg then the rest  might be a ltle scary f younger readers  maybe not  Yes someone does die que a few  fact  The only part of  this book i thought was a ltle screwy was the endg when u fd out who  the imposter is but very exg  a terric endg nevertheless! BUY  THE BOOK!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a terric sequal to JK Rowlg's first 3 books  the series  It was just as good  not better than the previous books  Harry Ron  Hermione face a hful of new challanges  a lot of fmation is given that sheds light on many other crucial  characters  the book  Even though this book is clearly a sequal  is  not predictable  tre  I was pleasantly surprised wh the twists   turns Rowlg placed  the style  I highly recommend HP4 to anyone  who has enjoyed the other Harry Potter books
Its nice when a series like Harry Potter comes along- the first book was  excellent  engrossg  the second  third both improved on the igal to some degree  I have to say though that I was unprepared f  the quantum leap JK Rowlg has made  wrg the fourth book  the  series  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is  a class by  self  From the begng wh Harry  friends attendg the Quiddch  Wld Cup tournament to the fal terryg  exhileratg chapters  &quotGoblet&quot delivers! My only complat is that now that I've  fished readg &quotGoblet&quot I shall have  to wa a long while  befe readg the next stallment!
I am a 5th grade teacher whose students have convced her to read the Harry Potter series  Last year I read books 1-3  anxiously awaed Book 4  After fishg the over 700 page novel last night at 12:30 I wanted to  talk to someone who had read   I was surprised at the level of tensy  Rowlg has wrten this book versus the previous three  There were scenes  which made me squimish  scared  Although Rowlg's abily to develop  credible characters still amazes me This book is a must read f Potter  fans
I have read the other three Harry Potter books  I loved all of them  This book was no exception  The plot was very terestg  suspenseful  There are many twists that will keep you readg!  In this book Harry's  fight agast the evil dark wizard Voldemt contues  Many terestg  facts about Voldemt's past get revealed This was by far the most  &quotadult&quot iented book of the four Harry Potter books  But I  believe that  is appropriate f all ages  If this is your first  experience wh Harry Potter I would recommend readg the other three  books first  I thk you could enjoy readg this book  you had never  read another Harry Potter book but a lot of the references to past books  would be lost  However JK Rowlg does do a good job of  briefly  paraphrasg some of the maj events from the other books
I'll adm   I am one of those adults who got hooked on Harry Potter even whout any children as an excuse  I bought my niece the first three books f Christmas  counted down the days until this release wh her  I was shocked by the length of the book when  arrived  I wondered   there was really so much to be said that  could fill all those pages  The second I started readg though I knew the answer was YES!This  book is by far the most complex  scary of the Harry Potter books thus  far  Harry is enterg his fourth year of school   addion to  learng me complex spells Harry is also growg personally  we see  him maturg throughout the book  I loved the scene wh his first  dance   brought back so many memies of my own first dancesThe  length of the book is also a sign of the maturg plot  the first 100   so pages pass befe Harry even returns to Hogwarts!  But the sty is  enthrallg from page one  the new characters are developped very  nicely durg this section  Once Harry returns to school the action grows  ever deeper he learns new me dangerous spells  we realize how  much he has learned  his previous three years at school  The action   this book builds up slowly Harry knows that somone is out there but he's  not sure who  why  And so the best defense is to keep on learng   to keep his eyes open studyg all those around him  The secrets will be  revealed soon enoughIf I had to compla about anythg  this  book  would be the way plots from the previous sties were entered to   at times  seemed that Rowlg grew impatient wh explag what had  ocurred  the previous sties  But sce the books build upon each  other some background was necessary  I thk the best preparation f  book 4 is to read the first three books  then to jump  an enjoy this  newest offerg  I eagerly anticipate the remag three books  I  hope that Harry's personal development contues  that the igaly  that Rowlg has shown  all the details of this series contue to she  throughe books  I  hope that Harry's personal development contues  that the igaly  that Rowlg has shown  all the details of this series contue to she  through
I had very high expectations f this book after readg the first three I loved the first three but &quotGoblet of Fire&quot completely blew me away The descriptions of the scenes  new characters were wonderful   the plot was great It had so many twists  turns   I had no idea  what was gog to happen next The old characters like Ron Hermione   Harry contue to become me terestg  volvg This book went far  beyond my high expectations I recommend  to everyone
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was the most excg book I have ever read  It has all the greatest qualies: suspense thrill mystery  also has some sad areas Because this is Harry's fourth year he  his  friends Ron  Hermione are me mature  seem to be takg a romantic  terest  other students  There are also 2 other schools that are  troduced  Harry goes through a lot  his 4th year: from the Quiddch  Wld Cup to the most terryg experience of his le  Every chapter  seems to leave me hangg  This always seemed to make me read me I had  fished the book befe I'd realized   It also had a me complex sty  le than I had expected  I'm 13  I thk this book rules  If anyone  is thkg of readg this  any Harry Potter book I defely suggest  !
Harry Potter  the Globlet of Fire wrten of course by the one  only JK Rowlg was the most bewchg enchantg  suspensful of all her Harry Potter creations so far Your heart will never stop poundg  throughout the tasks which Harry must perfm throughout the Triwizard  Tourtament  throughout the very eerie fal chapters of Harry Potter 4  JK's newest edion of her famed Harry Potter series seems to  take the reader to the book  have them live the hrs excement   tradgedies which Harry Potter faces  Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire also opens the dos (wh no efft at all  seems) to a  much welcomed  possibly even better sequel
While  is true that wh most series they tend to get wse  wse wh each passg volume I feel that this has been the near oppose case wh the Harry Potter books While I am not as fond of the third book as  nearly as much as the 1st two Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire puts the  previous three to shame It is an credible tome sure to delight children   adults alike There is the asstment of colful  delightful  characters that please the imagation   this stallation there is  darkness  dread that was hted at  previous volumes but is expled  me fully  this book Startg wh a bang at the Quiddch Wld Cup   followg the explos of the 4 Champions at the TriWizards Tournament  which is held at Hogwarts School this year -  gives us a chance to see  Harry Hermione Ron  Hagrid  a new set of circumstances that help  defe them me as characters ones that we have loved  grow to care  about as time goes on It also brgs Dumblede  Snape to lights we  never thought befe addg ambiguy  trigue to their characters  This only makes one me exced f what is to come  book 5  one can  only hope that will be out sometime  the near future
I bought this book f my grdaughter Her absolute delight  receivng  was wth ftiely me than the small sum that I paid f 
If you have read the first three books about the suddenly magical turn Harry Potter's le has taken then you CANNOT miss this newest stallment!  A great deal of media attention has surrounded the Harry  Potter novels but do not let the media make you skeptical  The Goblet of  Fire is a well-wth-the-wa addion to the Harry Potter family of  &quotchildren's&quot books  This is Harry's 4th year at wizardry school   while he is still dealg wh school bullys  teachers that seem to  have   f him new experiences seem to keep popg up wherever he  turns  Unwanted media attention  the wizard's daily newspaper me  challenges from Ld You-Know-Who  the most confusg challenge Harry  has yet encountered    *girls*!  Whatever kd of books you enjoy  readg Harry Potter has somethg f you  Read  Enjoy!  I haven't  been disappoted yet
I personally thk that this is the best book yet  the series It cludes very terestg charecters  has a dferent atmosphere than the other books me of an older teenage atmosphere I beleive that this is  also the scariest  the most exg book of the series It was great!   I would like to tell me but I wouldn't want to give  away so  you  want to know me you better hurry  get this book  read  your self
The fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series ends the carefree days of Harry's childhood  pches him headfirst to the wld of near-adulthoodThis is a much darker much me adult  still thoughly enjoyable stallment  this much-lauded  series
I couldn't believe how much me exg this book was than all the previous Harry Potter books  I loved the plotle the surprises the tragedies  They all made the book better  I can't wa f #5  READ THIS  BOOK!
I stood  le f the book at 7:50 AM on Saturday mng  fished at 2:35 AM Monday mng  It's the best Harry Potter book yet!  I consider  a kd of clf hanger but I won't tell you why  case some people haven't read  yet  It may be 734 pages long but 's wth  readg !
I thk this book was better than Prisoner of Azkaban Once aga Rowlg has managed to completely shock me wh the endg This book had everythgfunny parts sad parts scary parts And  is defely a  darker stythe end will leave you exhausted AND longg f  Book 5!  Harry faces the greatest challenges of his le (so far) And remember the  villian is NEVER who you thk  is
I loved this book I enjoyed the first 3 books  was enjoyed to faly get the 4th one This book was one of the best I have ever read All those who liked the first ones will love this one
As I eagerly awaed the 4th Harry Potter I could only guess what extradary thgs would happen My md was full of ideas about quiddch Harry his friends  the evil &quotYou-Know-Who&quot I  bought the book  immediately began to read   The idea that the book  was over 700 pages long did not bother me a b As wh the 1st 2nd   3rd I could not put the 4th book down f the next day  a half So many  thgs seemed dferent  Harry's hmones were startg kick  which  caught me off guard Hogwarts had many new thgs to show as well Evil  lurked  the air  When I was fally fished I concluded that JK  Rowlg had done  aga She had mesmerized me wh her wds  My thirst  is quenched f Harry Potter   f now at least   
This book is nearly impossible to put down  The Harry Potterseries may be classied as children's books because the macharacters are children but HP is plenty entertag f adults like me!  Rowlg's wrg has improved over the course of the 4 books  you hardly notice the 700+ pages because the action moves so quicklyIf you've ever tried to read a book  which the auth seems not to know her own characters you will thoughly appreciate Rowlg's adept character development  the characters' evolution over time  She knows them so well 's like you're actually watchg them grow up  You watch Harry  his friends mature to teenagers act like teenagers  have a teenage outlookThis fourth book has much me of a clfhanger-type endg than the others wh many questions left unanswered  Some mysteries are solved but many me have uncovered  awa the fth book
I have avoided spoilers  this review This book is to the Harry Potter series what &quotThe Empire Strikes Back&quot was to the Star Wars trilogy We learn me about our fave characters we watch them as they  contue to mature the stage is set f the ultimate conflict  the  future  the sty takes a darker turn Young readers who gobbled up the  adventures  perils of the first three books will fd thgs are gettg  tougher Good people die while others who should be fightg don't step  up We also fd out that some people we didn't like are really on the  right side  We've gotten to know our ma characters  the first three  books  we contue to learn  care about them  Everybody has an  opion who Harry Ron  Hermione should get romantically volved wh  which I thk is a sign of well drawn charactersThis book is not  perfect It drags  one  two places the transions are not entirely  smooth It's not seriousI believe the Potter books are as popular as  they are because what people really want to read  hear is a Sty the  kd where you can't wa to know what happens next to the people you care  about the kd of thg that could be read aloud around a fireplace  This  book delivers that  sets up what is to come When I fished this book  I had the exact same feelg I get at the top of a roller-coaster hill just  befe the car tips over It's gog to seem like a very long wa f the  next one
I have just fished  I thk fully absbed theexperience of the fourth Harry Potter  It is a very fast read owgto the fact that  can't be put down easily  Happily the patterns that the first books started fallg to are broken here  the ideas are a ltle fresher  It is credible lookg back through how ltle is wasted  Rowlg's wrg  All the ltle details she cludes no matter how seemgly frivolous at the time are cnerstones to the archecture of the fantasy I must clude sadly a &quothowever&quot hereMy pleasure  this  series is fadg somewhat as the sister  adult themes are on the rise   the nocence is becomg lost  This may seem to be n-pickg but I  thk the greatest pleasure derived from the series by the adult readers is  an nocent awe at the magical wld  That naivete gone the books will  beg to appeal I thk me to younger readers who aren't lookg back  too fondly on youth  experience than to adults  This is the way   should be I realize  I only knock a star off f the way the book  affects me  Rowlg is treatg the material as  must be treated   dog fabulously wh   I'm just missg the greener days aga
I absolutly loved this book!  It had a lot of suspense action  a perfect amount of romance  A bbok f adults  kids alike!   I thk JK Rowlg really captured all the details perfectly  It's almost as your livg the book!  I recommend this book to anyone
Readg &quotthe Goblet of Fire&quot was fast f me tryg to fish  so my eleven year old daughter could start It wasn't a problem wh this book even given  tremedous length The characters you love  hate  are all back  this stallment cludg some new characters The mystery  was not predictable  kept me guessg until the end The hum that we  have seen wh the previous Harry Potters was present also Charms spells  hexes  jxes are flyg throughout this sty  you are never sure  who is gog to get h One of the me terestg pots was learng  how to pronounce Hermione's name As a mother of three I highly recommened  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot to anyone who likes a good tale  wants to  see good triumph over evil The only problem I have is that now I have to  wa f the fth book Knowg the wa was wth  f &quotThe Goblet  of Fire&quot will make the wa bearable
I honestly thought that this book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire wouldn't meet up to all the hype  was gettg I thought  would drag out (I mean 752 pages!) the length just wouldn't wk I had no idea  the skill JK Rowlg has She took her characters  really added to their  le as wches  wizards They among other thgs went to see the  Quiddch Wld Cup which I found an excg addion  a part that  could even be a book self where the terr  trigue you always fd   a Harry Potter book started wh the return of the terrible Death  Eaters the followers of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named She described so vividly  their return  a way that sent hryg prickles down my spe the  same way the first chapter already brgg sudden deaths did But on a  lighter side even though evilk always stalks Hogwarts Harry Hermione   Ron did beg to grow up  found romance of sts where they'd least  expect     I don't want to give anythg away but the action  the  danger wh  was unbelievable Harry faces his greatest challenge yet   me ways then one No one is who you thk they are  no one can be  trusted A friend may not be  an enemy might change The endg was  troublg  left us wonderg what is to become of the not-so-perfect  le of the wizardg communy It left me wh an unsettled feelg that  somethg's just not right  left me wantg to know me But even as  secrets are left many are revealed The mystery of Herry's parents is  told  you learn somethg rather startlg about one of Harry's close  friends Neville Although this was certaly the darkest of all of her  books I feel Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was defely a success  If you read one book this summer I would defely recommend  to be  this one no matter how old you are This will appeal to kids  grown-ups  alike
The fourth stallation of the Harry Potter series is just as good as the first three  I wondered at first at the 700-page length but now that I've fished  I wouldn't change a b of   Harry is growg up  the events  the sty reflect thatjust like the other 3 books Goblet  of Fire is a wonderful read f kids AND adults eher alone  together   Buy !  Read !
I thought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great bookbecause I found  wasn't as far-fetched  spooky as the 2nd HarryPotter book The Chamber of Secrets -- although there is some danger    I liked the fact that certa characters cludg James  Lilly Potter  Wmtail returned  the fourth book  It is a suspensful book  has very humous parts too  Even though Harry has a secret crush  doesn't get all mushy  It is my fave of the four Harry Potter books
I am 12 years old  addicted to the Harry Potterbooks  Wh tons of new characters  even a close up Quiddchfal this book is very addictive I found the basic Good-guy Bad-guy rivalry(as  all books)But wh a newer twist How can Harry survive the latest challenges? Fd out  read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire!
This book was easily the best of the Harry Potter books leavg me cravg me after readg the 734 pages (igally rumed to be 752 pages) Rowlg brgs everythg to vivid le from the Quiddch Wld Cup to  Dumblede's memy Harry does fall  love (just a crush)  someone  does die but I'll leave you to read the book on your ownAll I can say is  &quotI can't wa until book 5&quot (probably not comg f another  year) The books gettg longer is great! It just thrills readers f  longer (even   is just a few days) Of course almost all children read  the books numerous time
It's too bad that this review thg will only let you choose 5 as the highest because  deserves at least a 10 This book was the best out of the four so far but 's length made  a ltle harder to follow I have read books much longer than this one but everythg  this book seemed  kd of hurried compared to the previous three The events  new  characters   are just as igal  creatively thought up as much of  the others from the three previous books I was afraid that Rowlg might  have lost a ltle b of her creativy  somethg but I assure you  this one captured me  pulled me to  just like the other ones The  whole plot  sty le are amazg  you'd never be able to guess what  happens I read the book  less than two days simply because I couldn't  put  down I was fced to keep readg  I even delayed meals to  squeeze  some me readg The entire book was thoughly enjoyed    was better than I expected  to be Many unexpected turns  the book made   me enjoyable Although this book was a ltle b darker  me  mysterious than the first  third ones I still thk  had the most  volved  complicated plot which made  better than the others I am  very glad that I went to the bookste at 12 o'clock on July 8th to get my  book It was extremely good  completely wth readg I hope  I  certaly thk that everyone will agree when I say that JK Rowlg has  caught the snch aga wh another awesome Harry Potter tale
Just like the first three books this stallment of the Harry Potter series reached right out grabbed me  would not let go until I had read the entire thg I fished  the eveng  was releasedOnce aga  Rowlg has created a plot contag twists  turns that outstrip most  adult-targeted books I've ever read The clues as always were right there   black  whe yet I did not see them on the first read through And  just like befe she has cluded hundreds of the ltle details that make  the wld of Harry Potter come aliveGoblet of Fire defely takes a  turn f the darker though It is not as whimisical as earlier books   the series offerg many pots  the plot that are far 'scarier'   tged wh the evilness of Ld Voldemt There *are* me deaths  this  book than we've seen befe  while they are not graphically described  no punches are pulled  makg  clear that the characters are deed  dead by evil's hF me as an adult of course this was a high  pot of this book--not the killgs per se of course but I enjoyed  seeg the series really get down to busess so to speak To see the  battle les beg drawn  the war you know is comg take shape But f  perhaps extremely young readers  listeners 's somethg to be aware of  nonethelessMuch like the entire series I can't recommned Goblet of  Fire highly enough--this imagative wld  the fight between good   evil that  ptrays is wthy of every ounce of praise  has ever  received Enjoy!
These books are great  Really  Most sequels just get wse but not harry Potter  Any fan J K Rowlg has to read this book  It's wth the while  I can't tell you what happens-that would ru   Just believe me  when I say this book is wth readg
The Goblet of Fire is by far the most complex  trigug book  the ongog Harry Potter  series Never befe have I read a book that expresses emotions  thoughts so perfectly addg to the wonderful plot   page turng suspense Somehow the characters seemed to have much me  personaly as they all played larger parts here than  the other three  sties The Goblet of Fire was well wth the months of tture I endured  while wag to read 
This is a really great book  It is funny excg suspensful  scary all at the same time  I am ne years old  read the whole book  three days  The other three Harry Potter books are great but this one is the best  I liked the Goblet of Fire because  goes beyond Hogwarts to a  Triwizzard Tournament  The tasks  the Tournament are so excg because  they are dficult  dangerous  Everyone should read this book  JK  Rowlgs should keep on wrg
As expected HP4 is me of the same wild adventures of Harry Potter but at the same time  is a ltle darker a ltle less tightly wrapped up at the end --  this is deliberate --  a ltle me true to Harry's  creasg ageMany rumours have flown about the book  despe  havg read every sgle one of them I am absolutely delighted to say that  even the ones that were true were sufficiently well hidden  twisted  that they did not reveal themselves until they happenedI genuely  cannot praise the book highly enough I can only add to the voices cryg  bter tears because now we have a year to wa befe the next  chapterBuy 
The fourth stallment of Harry Potter's adventures is well wth s extra length  The plot twists conta a number of surprises  our heroes go through que realistic teenage anxieties  problems  The  Triwizard Tournament ( the dark deeds behd ) develops nicely wh  surprises wag f the unsuspectg reader  It is darker than the  previous books wh some scenes which may be a b tense f younger  readers (though not graphic  their description)  However this is a  logical development of the overall plot  serves to set up the conflict  fthcomg  the remag three volumes of the series  Though one of  the longest children's books I've ever seen  reads quickly  refuses  to be set aside--every chapter begs the reader to turn just one me page   the old friends from previous books  new characters beg you to share  just one me scene wh them  A good read f older children (10+)   adults
I sat down at lunch yesterday  opened up the new Harry Potter book My plan had been to read  durg lunch breaks f the next few weeks I ended up takg  home stg down  readg until 2am It isn't  often that I s down  read 700+ pages  one stg but the Harry  Potter sties are nothg  not fectious This is easily the most  complex  darkest of the books touchg on polical activism buddg  sexualy jealousy  the dangers of petty beaurocracy Indeed  many  ways  feels like the second act of a play brgg the entire cast of  characters to their darkest hour  leavg you wh the certa  knowledge that the last page is only a pause  a  much larger sty  All  that beg said however this remas Harry Potter  all s charm  magic hum sweetness  delicious tension I can't wa to see what  happens next
&quotThe villagers of Ltle Hangleton still called  'the Riddle House' even though  had been many years sce the Riddle family had lived there&quotThis openg le of Harry Potter  The Goblet of  Fire immediately set the tone  stage f the entire sty It was obvious  that this book would be que dferent  style than the previous three  The language  the overall theme were decidely me mature than the  previous sties  don't fget this book was a whoppg 700+ pages  (unusual f a book classied as &quotchildrens  lerature&quot)Unlike the previous three this latest  the Harry  Potter series was much me suspenseful but  a me adult-like fashion  Perhaps this was deliberate on the part of JK Rowlgs After all our  teen hero is also becomg older  me mature wh each book The tone  of the entire first half of the book radiated a strong sense of febodg  At the end of the book the reader was left wh a sense of anxiety doom  but wh a fervent hope This book was defely darker than the first  threeBy far this was JK Rowlg's best wk Due to the wrg  style  some of the themes elements presented this book could easily be  classied as adult lerature  at least lerature f young adultsHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire was a very good read The wrg  style was much me vivid richly developed mature  clever than Books  1 2  3 It was que the chiller!
I really loved this book  I bought the first three to read wh my classes but this one I bought f myself  I would highly recommend this book to children of all ages  This auth is even better than Phillip  Pullman!  Harry has once aga found himself  trouble that he didn't  start  Wh the help of his friends  a ltle house elf he manages to  come out on top aga  Hermione gets a &quotnew&quot look Ron discovers  another meang of friendship  Harry reaches &quotthat age&quot  An  excellent book!  If you don't buy  f your children buy  f  yourself  spend a few hours  Hogwarts!
When I got the first book at my Scholastic Book Fair I simply aded  because I'm a person who loves to image thgs  fantasy books are my fave subject when  comes to readg After I fished Book 1 I read  book 2  book 3 When I heard that book 4 was comg out I was so  exced ( Sta like Gny whenever she saw Harry *Blush*) When I fally  got book 4  was the last copy  the book ste  I was soooo happy! I  started readg   the car  readg  2 hours a day  I adm I  cant stop readg  When I heard Harry had got a crush I was laughg so  hard (How cute puppy love!) I really recomend this book to anyone who  likes fantasy The Harry Potter series will really help children encourage  readg   will help them exp not only their md but the  imagation JK Rowlg YOU ARE THE BEST! HOORAY FOR  HARRY POTTER!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was the best yet  the series  I received the book at noon on the release date  couldn't put  down until I'd fished  the next night  Book 4 contas me suspense me  thrills me chills  is a b darker than the previous Potter books  however  wked really well to establish this pot  time as a pivotal  pot  Harry's le  Rowlg does an excellent job of not drawg one  style out f too long  The suspense is kept f just the right amount  of time while various sub-plots terplay  It draws you  to the pot  where you feel as  you are right there at Hogwarts cheerg Harry on  I  fully recommend this book  the entire series to everyone young   old
Usually when a sequel is promoted as heavily as the 4th Harry Potter novel  cannot possibly live up to the hype  But by cludg some new characters  challenges  leavg others out  JKRowlg has managed  to keep the 4th ( longest) book  the series feelg fresh  The  Goblet of Fire puts Harry  his friends to deeper danger then ever  befe  The number of challenges put  front of Harry  this book makes  the dangers he faced  the first three seem pale  comparison  In this  stallment me questions are answered about the rise of You-Know-Who's  power  A clearer picture emerges as to why everyone is so terried of  ever seeg  his powers return  Harry Potter remas the humble hero   he has matured at 14 but  a way that children of all ages can still  relate to  Just as wh the first three this book was impossible to put  down  The endg to Goblet of Fire leaves you wh a sense that the  next book will brg even me danger to Harry  his companions  I am  already lookg fward to !
Although I thought f sure I would be disappoted the fourth  the series was even better than the previous three!  She contues to weave an entrancg spell on her readers  I couldn't put  down  fished   the same day I started!  I can't wa f five
This book is by far the best yet The entire book from cover to cover is filled wh excment hum danger  a ty b of romance I know the book is long but  goes  very quick 's just as addictive as the other three I highly suggest this book to everybody Muggles Mudbloods   Purebloods alike
First I love these series  anythg that sounds negative is merely a reflection of my comparg  to the first three stallments The Goblet of Fire is overall great  However this is one case where perhaps Rowlg  went too far  plottg  droppg details that may  may not flower  to imptant hts about just what danger lies ahead f Harry  Goblet  gets off to a decidedly slow start  f some reason I can't que put  my fger on seems to have lost the &quotfun magic&quot  There are lots  of events that couldn't happen  the Muggle wld but these seem rather  drab perhaps I have come to accept the excement of Quidch  other  fantastic adventures as the nm but I found the first half of the book a  ltle too much like watchg football on TV  flippg to some crime  show durg the commercials All  all though this was defely a page  turner  we get to see me of the fave characters who have become  not only Harry's but all of our friends  A defe buy but I'm already  wag f #5  hopg 's better than this one By the way there are  parts of this book which I wouldn't want children under twelve to read  I  got up  checked under my bed   my closet me than once!
I just fished the book today after readg almost nonstopf two days I must say that this is one of the best books I have everread  a great addion to the Harry Potter style  The plot kept the pages turng  one new dovelopment added to another Highly recomended
After 734 pages your first thought will be &quotWhen is the next one comg out?&quot  This stallment of Harry Potter slowly takes you away from the wld of Muggles  to a place which wh every book is beg  me familar  Back are all the lovable( no so loveable) characters  wh new ones poppg up to contue the style  This book deed has  a darker tone but as the style contues to s hric climax you  will not be able to stop readg I hesate to expla why Book 4 is so  great f fear of givg away even a sliver of the style Just know  that every one of the 734 pages is a imptant part of a fascatg sty  that just gets better  better  &quotWhen is the next one comg  out! &quot
Harry's experiences  the wizardg wld are peeled back like the layers of an onion  this 4th Potter novel In addion to fightg mystical battles on Hogwarts grounds  a tournament he didn't enter -- but  mysteriously is selected to participate  he fds what the thgs he  really holds most dear are When he is at his noblest moment le takes a  serious --  deadly -- turn f the entire wizardg wld! Rowlg very  successfully keeps us wag wh suspense f the next thg to happen
Fans of Harry Potter may at first be taken aback by the darker tone of this latest JK Rowlg book but  is still her best efft to date (Which is sayg a lot)  Rowlgs usual strong believable characters fill  this book  help yet aga to brg this fantasy wld to le  Very  young readers may wish to steer clear of this one f a while as is does  conta some mature elements  at 734 pages  may timidate some new  readers (Young  old!)  All considered however the book is a  masterpiece  I encourage you to enjoy  wh your children
Sce Amazon delivered Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire to my do  has kept me readg at all hours of the day There is somethg about the way JK Rowlg wres the Harry Potter books that makes every reader wish  that she could go to Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry I am   rema sce the very first book trigued by Harry's sense of hum   all the complicatg twists In this book I particularly liked how the  auth made so many terestg thgs happeng at once that you will be  kept on the edge of your seat The characters from Beauxbatons   Durmstrang added me complexy to the twists  even though she was  rude I liked how Ra Skeeter couldn't take her nose out of people's  busess I thoughly enjoyed readg this book  I can't wa f the  next one This is defely a good book because I have never befe read a  734 page book  three days!
You would thk that  a book of over 700 pages the 4th  a series the auth would lose some momentum that maybe the attention to detail would decle  that she would fall to repetion Rowlg suffers from none  of these ailments In his fourth year at Hogwarts Harry Potter is as vivid  as everHe  all of the books' wonderful characters are volved   yet another excg series of events full of suspence hum  me new   colful magical ventions  places You have not read any of the  Harry potter books this Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is your  fourth reason to beg
Fourteen-year-old Harry Potter deals wh adolescence the latest stallment of JK Rowlg's successful series  While longer (700+ pages)  somewhat scarier  is every b as much fun to read as s predecesssFans of the  first three books will be glad to see the return of some fave  characters  Dobby the elf Harry freed  year two shows up as does  Sirius Black Harry's godfather  Rowlgs deftly weaves them to the plot  whout becomg repetiveThe auth's unique sense of hum  permeates nearly every chapter  she even sneaks  some jokes that only  adults  older kids will getThe characters use a few  bad wds  this book as teens are prone to do  you get the sense  that the auth is agg the material wh her audience  But they rema  likable kids  that's the real charm of these booksThe kids rebel push rules get punished but there is an  underlyg respect not to say veneration f their teachers  parents  (except f the Dursleys of course)Rowlg doesn't malize much  A  glarg grammatical err blunts one of the few attempts to make a pot  Still the books do teach mal lessons  are even a ltle spirg at  times-but don't tell the kids
This book has some of the igal magic of the beggg books of the series but  also has some problems The plot while  developes goes off to to dark of a man f some young children who might be readg   The book tho does have some of the elements of the igianls but seems  rushed  too long wh too much filler Overall  is a good book wthy  of 4 stars
I adm  I'm an adult who has looked fward to this book me than most kids It did not disappot  the slightest! The tones  the plot are darker wh some scenes that might overwhelm the under-12 crowd but   was a defe page-turner I found  hard to put down  fished    a recd two days Needless to say I'm eagerly awag the fth
I love the new Harry Potter book!  starts of wh the creepy first chapterthe riddle house  's so captivatg! I started to read   i couldn't stop even to eat!Ftunately i'm a fast reader the endg totally  caught me off guard  i am eagerly anticipate the fth book It starts  off wh the murder of the riddles  how a frank bryce was accused of  killg them when frank bryce is killed himself by Ld Voldemt  the  help of his snake Nagi Harry Potter wakes up It starts off right away  wh the Quiddch wld Cup a lot of hum thanks to Fred  Gege  Weasley  has a lot of gloom   too When JK Rowlg said there  would be death  this book she wasnt kiddg THe end is amazg wh  Cnelius fudge's stubbness Snape secret Dumlede's nobleness   harry's courage Harry Potter truly is a role model f me to st true   to not back down to evil  this case Ld Voldemt this whole book  showed me the evilness of evil noblest a person can be the courage   side everyone  the light always shg  the end Whatever comes will  come  we'll be ready when  does
I thk this book was very well wrten  I couldn't lay  down  when I did I felt guilty Wh the rums of someone dyg I was terried f the characters  I was surprised at who was &quotkilled off&quot I  recommend this book f anyone who wants to get away from the wld f  awhile
This book is best of all the Harry Potter books It might be larger than Moby Dick but every page is wth !
this is one of the best books i've ever read s better then the first 3 very well wrten very excg  unpredictable lots of twists  turns you will be at the edge of your seat wattg to read what happens next  but when you fish  you want the 5th book to be out on the shelfs but the  clear keep you  suspens
I couldn't put the book down  The sty was true to the Harry Potter characters as well as teenage fears  foibles  Beware the endg might be scary to younger readers but they won't want to stop  You absolutely have to fd out what happens
Clearly Rowlg is a master sty-teller  I just fished the fourth book  wow  I won't give away anythg but I will say that  is best to start readg the book when you don't have anywhere to go f a few hours  Rowlg has aga managed to grasp you on page one  not let go until the  end of the book  Every time I thought  was safe to put the book down I  read somethg that grabbed me aga  Her mix of description  action  once aga amaze me  Considerg the fanfare that accompanied this book  publishg I can only image what will accompany the publishg of the  fth book  If you haven't read any Harry Potter books I highly recommend  them  All the hoopla is thoughly justied
It is probably evible that due to this series' overwhelmg populary negative cricism from &quotexperts&quot will follow  Book 4 The Goblet of Fire doesn't deserve   The protagonist (Harry) the  plot  the allusions  the sty le have all matured  JK Rowlg's  books deserve to be considered classic lerature My fourteen year old son  fished the book  less than two days  He loved  His comments wh  eyes shg were &quotThis is really dark this is really good  It all  fs together&quot There is no question  my md that this is a book  f the older youth maybe a mature 11 year old  older  The sty is  darker me &quotreal&quot  clearly pivotal f the remag books   the series  Please don't push this one on your younger reader  Please  do let your older child enjoy the auth's crazy off-center wld  realistic tension between right  wrong   lovg  accurate  ptrayal of the early teen years
Oh my God this book is amazg s obviously the pivotal novel  this series  s imptance is tremendous It's a real turng pot  the series wrten f a me mature audience JK Rowlg holds ltle back  towards the end All three ma characters fall  love  Harry's fourth  year at Hogwarts is almost unrecocnizable from his first three Faced wh  me danger at every turn s amazg that there are only 3 deaths The  end was so shockg  surprisg that I have to read  aga It's also  very scary  the surprises almost rival the endg of the third book  Trust me this is not a book to miss but be warned you may need to drop  everythg to read this one I read f ne hours straight from 5:30 pm  on the 8th to 2:30  the mng Do not take this book lightly! JK  Rowlg specically says that this is the most imptant one (which might  expla s length of 734 pages) READ IT!
I was among the first  le to recieve my copy of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire on July 8th  no sooner had I arrived home I was already curled up on the couch engrossed  this novelYear 4 at Hogwarts brgs us many changes to the stard Harry Potter plot After summer    the Quiddch Wld Cup have ended the spt that Harry loves so much  disappears from JK Rowlg's text In s place a tournament between 3  &quotChampions&quot one each from Hogwarts  two other feign schools  of wizardry And besides Harry's lighteng-shaped scar contuously  hurtg you'd almost never know that evil Ld Voldemt had anythg to  do wh the year at schoolNot only has the stard plot of the series  changed a ltle but the characters have as well Harry now at 14 fds  himself almost cynical  annoyed wh people he's matured  I have to  say that I like him much better now Ron struggles harder than ever to fd  dividualy as Charlie  Bill his brothers return home makg    even harder to get lost  the crowd of redheads Even tws Fred   Gege seem to be growg up Hermione takes charge towards a good cause   fds herself becomg me physically attractive   the likes of  a boyI know that older readers will be enjoyg this novel much me  than s suggested age group Besides s length there are many thgs  that may just be too creepy f them slightly me so than the previous  books The Unfgivable Curses are a  matter of tture used contuously throughout the book Limbs are chopped  off among other physical harm I personally love this changes It shows  that Rowlg has grown comftable to wrg about Hogwarts  about  Harry  I love what she's done Not only is the wld she's created  realistic 's credibly easy to image yourself  to get caught up    Don't be frightened by s length f I know you will pick up Harry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire  not put  down until ever last wd on  page 734 echoes through your md This is one you won't fgetoblet of Fire  not put  down until ever last wd on  page 734 echoes through your md This is one you won't fget
I liked at the begng how  was very mysterious  excg The book is very fast-paced  excg I liked how much we found out  that book also  that there were so many surprises  This book was probaly the  best book JK Rowlg has ever wrten I know some might thk the book  is too long but f me the longer the better When I was readg the book I  wanted  to end so I would know what happened but I also wanted  to  never end I thought nothg could be better than the third book bur  rowlg amazed me aga  the fourth was the best I thk Rowlg is one  of the best wrers ever I hope she makes me than seven books
They are wonderful because ltle kids can read them underst them to a certa degree but teenagers  adults are notbed to tears they are drawn to the sty equally as much  not me because they can analyze  relate to the dferg suations which Harry  his friends ( enemies) evably face I reccommend this book as well as the other three ( I'm sure the three me to come) to any of you out there who are beg rebellious  tryg to stay out of the Harry Potter fan club  Reallythey're wth a read
Hi!  I loved this book  the way we are drawen  to themagical wld of wizards  is the best book of the year!  2 thumbsup!   The best book  Australia was the third book even adults love this book a great read f every  any body!  Because even my bld friend can read !   A magical wld f every body to enter  enjoy the sad times happy times  the funny times!
I must say JK Rowlg didn't pull out any stops f thisone From the new characters the very dferent plot to the sheerlength of the book she has taken a dferent turn wh this latest stallment of the series  's f the better I really don't want to give away much of the plot to those of you who haven't read  yet but  is defately wth readg the whole 735 pages I will tell you this  is a darker book than the first three the danger is much me real You can defately tell that the series is gettg me mature as Harry ages Harry even begs to have an terest  girls Voldemt will have a stronger presence  this one  you will learn thgs about several characters' pasts that will make thgs  the previous books make me sense Well I'm ramblg tell you what go buy the book It's awesome   my opion better than the first three See f yourself
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was unargueably the bestbook I have ever read  my le I JUST fished   I amcompletely  awe  made me laugh cry  eve scared be a ltle JK Rowlg is an absolute lerary genius I cannot say enough good thgs about this book A MUST read f kids  adults
Despe all the media frenzy JK Rowlg has kept the tegry of the series tact Goblet of Fire is the longest book yet but  is well wth the efft to read This sty seems to be a transion to how the fal  three books  the series will play out Though this sty is darker   full of suspense I still found  to be funny  genue
The Fourth Book does not fail to meet up to the Wonderful qualy of the first 3 Wh an extremely engagg style ( which I will not give away here!) as well as some que unexpected twists I was engrossed from  Saturday to Monday night  when I fishedIt was even a Ltle scarier  than I expected towards the end but all  all a very good book I look  fward to the 5th!
I will be blunt this book is much darker than the others at times i felt like I was readg one of the deathstalker novels rather then a childs book  JKR seems to have changed some small details of the universe detailed  the first three books to f the plot of the fth book that  said the book is great adventure  a surpurb read
The latest long-awaed Harry Potter is almost a fully satisfyg read  Every fave cast member is back: Harry Ron  the Weasleys Hermione Dumblede Hagrid the villanous Snape along wh Malfoy  his  Slyther cronies  Dobby rejos the troupe along wh Wky a new  house-elf Less appealg than Dobby this melancholy pixy gives Hermione  fuel f her crusade to liberate house-elves a nice b of comic relief   this darkest of the Potter novels  JK Rowlgs is total master of the  psychology of her characters as well as of her readers  From the begng  of the book stress ( suspense) build to a climax are resolved   after we've all had a breather the next adventure is upon us  the pages  must keep on turng faster  Nuances are revealed  the old familiar  characters (Hagrid wh a love terest!) Me than  the first three  there is violence death  evil  this fourth sty  But I would not  steer young children away from  because this wld is also full of evil  happengs  The sister actions of the villas only play up the basic  goodness courage  selflessness of Harry  his friends      To  appreciate this book the reader should really beg wh the first  the  series  The macabre events  the Chapter One of Goblet of Fire make sense   you've already been troduced to the villa  And there is a wonderful  development of personaly  character  the prcipals over the course  of the four books      This book begs wh a ghastly happeng  when   concludes there has been an credible amount of plottg  mayhem  much of which goes unresolved  I wanted to turn the page when the last  chapter concluded  keep on readg  So many questions are hangg there  f the next volume that could not have been answered  those 734 pages       I am an adult reader (age 61) of this book who reads a great deal  mostly nonfiction  I like the Harry Potter books very much because the  action is entirely igal the plots are perfect the characters  beautully drawn the proper names sheer genius the funny suations  hilarious the dialog fely tuned the timg  pace breathtakg   the psychology the wk of a virtuoso    I shall keep rereadg until  Harry Potter V makes s debut
Loved each  every wd of  MsRowlg proves that thepopulary of Harry Potter series is not mere media-hype In this bookHarry is pched agast a resurgent Voldemart leadg to a good climax The book fishes wh enough danglg threads makg you yearn f book 5 I fd that this book has me of a whodunn air than 's predecesss This mystery is telligently woven  a magical wld wh 's wizard logic The villa of the book is a clever secret Somehow I prefer the endg of previous books to the one  this I thk the reason is this does not have a good happy wholesome endg-  is me pensive  mournful But I thk me pyrotechnics is  ste  future wh villas gangg up openly Happy readg friends
Don't let s length put you off--the fourth Harry Potter book is defely wth  JKRowlg's wrg is as imagive as ever wh the usual plot twists along the way The only two problems I see are that  young children may be frightened by some of the scenes  that the villa  &quotgives away the plot&quot at the end I defely recommend this  book
There are not enough adjetives to adequately even begdescribe what is so wonderful about this book I laughed I cried Ibecame part of all that is that magical wld called Hogwarts I should be embarrassed to adm that I am thirty eight  thk these are about the best darn books ever wrten but hey let's just throw pride by the waysideI LOVE HARRY POTTER!  There is only one disappotg aspect of the book  that is that there are only gog to be seven! I hope by then Ms Rowlg has conjured up another hero to sate our appete f her wonderful stys  our longg to extend our childhood even  only f a few hours  days while readg her books Thanks JK Rowlg f givg me that gt this past weekend while begame lost  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire It was posively enchantg
The books starts out wh great promise as new trouble brews f Harry Mysterious actions by &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody create suspense that's not resolved until the end of the book But the Triwizard Tournament seems to  be me of a plot device to toduce new characters than a real test of  Harry's skills Those came later  yes the Tournament was the way that  Harry got to trouble but that was so heavily fshadowed from the start  that the Tournament was a b of a let down f meNever-the-less the  novel fishes wh a solid endg leavg us knowg that a great deal  me will be happeng to Harry  the next novel
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is an absolutely brilliant tribute to the rest of the Harry Potter series  However  is que dferent  Then aga dferent is goodIn the book summary on the  side cover &quotGoblet of Fire&quot was described as  &quotpivotal&quot  I can thk of no better wd to describe   As the  middle pot of the book series  is defly a turng pot wh  plenty of changes  Still retag the igal magic that enchanted so  many this book contas me adult hum utter terr a b of romance   the most utter heart-wrenchgs than I've seen  the other books  It  is absolutely brilliantHarry is now 14  certaly acts like   He   Ron have discovered girls which leads to some pretty hilarious scenes   There is also a dream come true: a trip to a professional Quiddch  Tournament  And at Hogwarts a special event has been set up f the  school year volvg two other schools: a tournament (to bridge  relationships  understg between wizards ect)  And most  imptantly there are rums that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named shall rise  aga&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is a must-read!   It is full of the excement  adventure we've come to appreciate   Still Rowlg is agg her books along wh Harry so this one may not be  as suable f ltle children as the igal  There is a particularly  scary chapter Unlike the predesscs this book ends on a me fearful  note  A me serious note is taken on  the end is powerful beautul  well-wrten but a sad tear-jerker  And Harry IS growg up  But  overall the book is excellent!
Although I would not want to give away any plot details I will say this: the book jacket's synopsis is accurate  the extreme  I expect the rest of the novels to be a direct contuation of the plot twists troduced   Goblet of Fire  All  all an excellent efft on the part of Rowlg
Wow  Hundreds of thouss of people out buyg this book like mad  no one's taken the time to review  yet?  So I'm the first  YahooMy friend is a middle school science teacher  was responsible f gettg  me hooked on Harry Potter  The 4th novel was a slightly belated birthday  present  But a good one  Ol' Harry Potter has come through aga  F  those of you older folks who are dumbfounded as to the craze I urge you to  pick up these books  read them Though aimed at a slightly younger  audience I still love them And I'm 26I won't try to summarize the  book sce Amazon has already done soSo read the Harry Potter books   you'll be a better person because of 
The fourth novel  the Harry Potter series is obviously gog to play a pivotal role  the development of the overall plot  At 734 pages  brgs back a lot of characters from previous books  troduces many  new ones creatg a cast that seems likely to uny the books that come  befe  after  The action is  possible me sweepg  epic than   any of the previous sties  the wa f the fth book is likely  to be the hardest readers have experienced so far  The Goblet of Fire is  the most spellbdg yet but parents of young children should be warned   is also darker  me frighteng than the previous books
This fourth stallment is not disappotg!  When I first began the series I could not image any of the sequels surpassg the first  plot hum  overall enjoyabily  However each sequel contues to exceed  my expectations  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is no exception  Although considerably ( happily) longer I found each chapter very  excg leadg to a thrillg battle between good  evil  I thought I  had actually guessed the villa this time  Although I had part of   right I still had been completely outwtedI highly recommend this  book to older children  adults  Thank you Ms Rowlg f another  great Harry Potter adventure!
The 4th Harry Potter book is every b as imagative wty  clever as the first three  It is also much scarier than any of the others  Given the number of small children who love Harry ( rightly so!) I would warn  all parents to read the book befe sharg  wh their children younger  than juni-high age  decide  's appropriate f them  not I  would also have like to see some resolution to Hermione's struggle to  liberate the house-elves that plot le got left hangg
I got this book on Saturday after 6:00PM via FedEx  I fally put  down  went to bed at about 2:30  the mng  It was an absolutely enthrallg readThis book is much darker  scarier  content than  the previous books  has a much me &quotadult&quot feel One feels  by the end of the book that the gloves are off as regards Magic/Muggle  relations  the past/future suppters of Voldemt (I won't say me  as I don't want to spoil  f anyone) -  other wds the risks are  creasg  there is much me at stake f the protagonists than  losg the House Cup to SlytherThe book is also extremely funny   places  pokes a b of sly fun at the English tabloid press (of which  unftunately f her Ms Rowlg is all too familiar) ternational  relations  the various pfalls of datg  romance among other  thgsAs mentioned there is also a romantic subplot featurg various  characters that is charmg  wholly  keepg wh the ways boys   girls (wizards  no) gradually discover an terest  the oppose sex as  they advance to their teensThe same themes of the imptance of  friendship stickg up f one's prciples defendg the weak   &quotdferent&quot  treatg others as one would like to be treated  are contued  this stallment As usual the message of tolerance   love is well-expressed whout beg preachyI am afraid there may be  some ltle outcry agast Ms Rowlg due to some extremely m swearg   some slightly off-col jokes  Sce I don't have kids this didn't  bother me at all (I don't thk  would bother me even  I did) but I am  sure a few of the me reactionary parental uns out there will be  freakg out over the Damage to America's Youth  God knows they should be  me wried about the WWFIn any case most enjoyable  I can hardly  wa f the next book  I hope we don't have long to wa!!
I had been wag impatiently f Book 4 of the Harry Potter series   was everythg I expected  me  At first I was a b shocked to discover that  was 734 pages but now that I've fished I can't wa  f the next book!  The excg scenes of the Triwizard Tournament kept me  on the edge of my seat  Harry learns of the joys ( miseries) of  teenage romances  We learn trigug fmation about Hagrid Ld  Voldemt  the rest of the wizardg wldJK Rowlg has not  disappoted me wh a host of new engagg characters: Mad-Eye Moody  Vickt Krum Madame Maxime Fleur Delacour Ra Skeeter  Ig  Karkaroff among others  The battle between good  evil  contuesWas all the publicy wth ?  Yes!  Book Four may be the  best book yet not to mention the longest scariest pivotal  most  excg  If you enjoyed the other Harry Potter books  love fantasy  books I highly recommend this novel
My fave book remas the first one however at twice the length this book does pack  twice as much fun (Quiddch Wld Cup Triwizard Triathalon etc)

I just fished readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Wow! It was an extremely powerful book  The endg has all the twists  turns we have come to expect from the auth  I must adm  took me a ltle longer to get to the book sce this one does not start out wh Harry at  the Dursleys as we have come to expect  It seems like she decided to  change the fmat slightly to keep us all guessg although  does go from  summer to summer like the others but she made some changes  the flow of  the school year  There are many new characters cludg new schools of  magic  Inially  is dficult to keep them all straight  Rowlg does  an excellent job of cludg past histy to refresh our memies  She  brgs back many pivotal characters from the other books  She is also  fabulous at capturg the emotions of a 14 year old dealg wh  loneless friendship ridicule  datg She deals wh some social  issues as  the past but the funniest is the troduction of the wizard  press  This book contues the trend of beg a ltle darker than the  last  I asked my 8 year old   scared him at all  he said  did a  ltle  But he was que taken wh the battle that she sets up at the  end (I don't want to give anythg away)  There are some deaths  this  one - the one closest to the ma characters is hled touchgly  This  novel brought me to tears  a few places  had me laughg out loud   others  I can't wa f number 5!
Harry Potter is the best book  the wld We first found out about Harry Potter on Amazon  I have been a fan ever sce  These are books that are just fabulous From the watertight plot to the magical characters all  the time you spend readg these will be wthwhile!

I couldn't put the book down once I started  havg fshed the book I can't wa f the 5th book to see how the plot goesVery vivid pictures were pated  the book   can be scary
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire made me laugh  made me cry wh 's tricate design of problems f Harry to face  Rowlg is a true artist wh wds  This book can be read aga  aga unlike other  mystery books  I couldn't pry my eyes away from !
Not a disappotment at all! The Harry-mania is absolutely justied THE GOBLET OF FIRE is every b as trigug as the other three  thrillgly complex! I didn't fd the length to be a frustration but  rather a privilege I loved that  was so long because I didn't want  to  end Harry's maturation is defely manest  this one  there's a  sophistication that his first three years didn't have It's completely  wonderful
_Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire_ gripped me from the openg scene at the Riddle House (like so many of Rowlg's creations very aptly named) to the end-of-year partg at Kg's Cross Station  Though the book's length  may give rise to caution among those wary of sequels JK Rowlg has by  no means succumbed to the diarrhea of the pen too often found  wrers of  multiple bestsellers  Like the previous three Harry books &quotThe  Goblet of Fire&quot is well paced  tautly structured  It really does  require all 734 pages of the American edion to tell the whole tricate  sty  rather as much of the sty as the auth will reveal at this  timeIn book four Rowlg (tentionally  not) gives a nod to many  questions large  small posed by her fans  We learn who does the cookg   cleang at Hogwarts what happened to Neville Longbottom's parents  how to pronounce &quotHermione&quot where other schools of magic may be  found  what Dumblede can really be like when he's angry  We learn  me about Hagrid the Malfoys  Snape (one of the most terestg  developments is a ht that Snape's relationship wh Harry may undergo a  change f the better  the future)  Along wh Harry Ron  Hermione  we learn of hexes  curses  defenses agast the Dark Arts  And  always Rowlg manages to weave together the least details  most  seemgly unrelated subplots to a whole that is cohesive uncontrived   satisfyg - though leavg the reader wantg much me  At about  page 600 I found myself very sry that there were only 100-some pages to  go because I knew that this would be all I would have until book five  I  haven't felt that way about a book sce hearg Sam Gamgee say &quotWell  I'm back&quot  wishg I could keep followg him Frodo  their  friends through me adventures  Middle-earthThe much-discussed first  fays to romance f the leadg characters are lightly  deftly  hled  while imptant are certaly not a ma focus of the book  The effect of the romance subplots is to show how Harry Ron  Hermione  are growg up  begng to see themselves  one another  new ways  Along wh romantic yearngs they beg to exhib other changes: Ron  becomes edgier  me outspoken Hermione learns to shrug off ridicule   be less rule-bound  Harry contues to develop the bravery   val of his parents -  of his House's founder Godric  GryffdHarry's biggest challenges so far not surprisgly come   this book  Instead of flyg  Quiddch matches he is volved  an  imptant year-long event that has temparily superseded Quiddch at  Hogwarts  The challenges he overcomes  the course of this event fm the  ce of the book  Woven to the sty are Ld Voldemt  his  servants  their attempts to brg He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back to full  le  power  Mysterious disappearances  even a death  two   &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot have as  any good mystery sty me  than one plausible suspect  as wh any good mystery sty the  solution ultimately eluded my several attempts at deductive reasong -  though the clues are presentDeath casts a shadow over book four  particularly  the fal chapters where the usually boisterous  end-of-year banquet is que somber  the conclusion of the special  year-long event is robbed of s triumph  But as Rowlg told The Times  &quot you really are honestly gog to exame evil actions then you  have a mal obligation not to fudge the issue&quot  Her hlg of  murder  this book is sensive  not I thk likely to engender  nightmares  young readers as Rowlg promised  is &quotupsettg but  not damagg&quotI can't say the book was completely perfect  Some  m flaws exist: Harry nocently poses a question to which he should  well know the answer from a previous book he convenient overlooks a  recently-learned spell that could easily resolve a certa dficulty he  wnesses a magical effect  which the results come somewhat out of der  In addion to notg these m errs I was a b dissatisfied wh  the way the endg of the year-long event was hled - I would have liked  a b me pomp  ceremony  a b me official attention to the  tragedy of the death that occurs  However I can see why Rowlg ends the  year at Hogwarts on a quieter note than usual  One very good result of  this is that Harry is given time  space to recover from his deals  which is a refreshg change from the usual adventure series  which the  hero bounces from crisis to crisis wh no time to absb reflect   grieveTime  re-readg will certaly offer me new perspectives on  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot  But meanwhile I'm glad to say that this  is an excellent addion to the Harry Potter sties  one I will  certaly read aga  aga - while wag eagerly f book five!

Havg enjoyed fantasy  hr fiction all my le this novel ranks wh the best of them   children's  adult's fiction  However the climatic scene is as harrowg as anythg I have ever read  It is much  scarier than anythg  the other Harry Potter books  Ld Voldemt is  revealed  all his sadistic nature  I genuely believe that this scene  could give nightmares to some kids  Parents should make sure they read the  book wh their kids at least at this pot  preferably not just  befe bedtime  I did  was sleepless f an hour --  I'm 44 years  old!That said  was very well wrten wh the rich characters   emotional development we've come to expect from the Harry Potter books  Harry aga displays all the virtues we'd like to see our own kids emulate  -- courage unselfishness generosy loyalty  persistence -- while  still beg a nmal human beg wh real problems  It helps kids to know  that even a hero has to deal wh envy gossip unfair authy figures  friends who squabble  unrequed crushesJK Rowlg has  miraculously avoided makg this series to a bg fmula like so many  book series f children  She sists the characters grow  develop    this novel she experiments wh dferent pots of view  a much  darker turn of events  She explas many previously puzzlg aspects of  the sties then dangles a lot me to keep us terestedAlthough  I'm a ltle wried about readg this to my 7-year old I know I will  We'll both look fward to the rest of the books  the series
I can say  was well wth the wa f the latest chapter  the Harry Potter series though I was so eager to fd out what happened that I read the book  three days! The sty  action are that compellgNot to  give too much of the sty away to those who haven't read  yet I will  say that Rowlg's wrg is very vivid  draws the reader to the  lives of the Hogwarts fourth-year students Her description of the  Quiddch Wld Cup f example is que stunngas  Rowlg had  attended one herself The mystery of Voldemt's connections at Hogwarts  once aga threw me off track -- I had picked one character to be the  baddie   turned out to be someone else I image other Harry fans  will be equally surprised to see how this sty unfoldsTrue to her  wd this stallment does have a darker tone as tensions between Harry   friends come to play particularly between Ron  Hermione One  wonders  Rowlg plans on pairg the two  the futureThe one thg  that doesn't make me happy is that I read the book so quickly  I don't  know when Book 5 is due Hurry up JK!
i have read all the harry potter books  am almost theough wh this one (pg576 out of 759) s the longest of the series but i thk most kids can hle the length hell i can  im 12   is amazg thers no bg BS about everyones histy the whole thg is pure suspence  is very  deep It is also noticably darker than the others  the language is  slightly rougher wh the wd &quotdamn&quot appearg a few times but  thats   i have no problem wh that but over protective parents might  ANYWAY i loved    is not that long really
Well wth the wa!  Another wner from JK Rowlg  Don'tlisten to the crics who grumble  whe about the book beg toolong  wdy because they're dead wrong ( a bter ltle bunch of muggles to boot)The only downside at this pot is I have to wa f book five  JK need another proofreader?  -)About the series: All the Harry Potter books are a must f readers young old   between  Start wh book one stead of jumpg to the series wh book two three  four
As the ttoise proved to the hare a slow start isn't always a bad thg  In her fourth book Rowlg spent as many pages buildg the plot as some of the previous books took tellg the whole sty  Although  was a b  slow to start  was wth the wa  The climatic moments were     SPELLBINDING  Battles  tasks keep the reader on edge  Once the sty  gets gog 's nearly impossible to put down  Rowlg also moved  somewhat away from children's sty fm  this novel  The Goblet of Fire  had much me feshadowg twists turns  romance than most  adolescent books  The new love terests troduced make the sty much  me fun to read  give the reader me people to love  to hate  She once aga creates a host of easily lovable characters whom are hard to  fget  At over 700 pages  is a tad long especially f a young  reader but Rowlg proves once aga that  the long run slow  steady  proves to make an excellent sty  Plot  characters defely deserve  the full five stars however the books massive length  slow spots make   a dauntg task f even many adult readers
All I can say is that the Harry Potter series is addictg  Can I give  about 20 stars? I am almost 22 years old  I cannot seem to get enough of this series  I applaud JK Rowlg f treatg children wh respect   knowg that they do not need to be talked down to  der to enjoy a  sty  Also thank you f lettg adults get as wrapped up  the sty  le as well  I warn readers now the last 50 pages of this book basically  gives you a new styleYOU WILL WANT BOOK 5 to be out as well!  That  is the key to success  Rowlg has so accomplished that
This is THE most exg book I have ever read!Joanne Rowlg is my favoure wrer she is at her best  this bookI thk that all Harry Potter fans will agree wh me when I say this is the most exg Harry  Potter novel yetI don't want to give away to much of the plotbut you  might need tissues!
In my opion the newest novel  JK Rowlg's seven-book Harry Potter series is her best wk yet  Harry Ron  Hermione are  their fourth year at Hogwarts  facg many new  excg challenges cludg the  Triwizard Tournament a competion between three schools of magic that  hasn't occurred f over a century  The characters  the novel were me  believable than  the past three books  the plot was much me  entertag wh lots of twists  turns that keep the reader on the  edge of their seat  Although this book wasn't as cheerful  lighthearted  as the first  second books  was still funny  immensely enjoyable  Anyone who liked Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban won't be  disappoted
This the fourth volume of Ms Rowlgs Harry Potter series is an excellent read I am 20 years old  would never have thought of readg a &quotchildrens book&quot  my sister had not waved the first volume   front of my face  told me  was wth a look So skeptically i picked   up  was pulled to a wld i have hardly ever been pulled to by a  book The sty was truly immersive After fishg the first i had to  read the second  third They only got better as the series went on This  series of books is truly f all age groups though some children might need  help wh the references/language that the books conta When the fourth  stallment came out i knew i had to buy  I read   the day that  followed  wish even now that i hadn't fished  so quickly Wag  f the next one will be an excrutiatg task f I must know what happens  next The Goblet of Fire is a pivotal book  the series It outles the  plot that will start to happen from now on Rowlgs Potter series is  truely captivatg They appeal to the ner child of us all  exp our  imagations I defely recommend this tle to anyone who is lerate  Now to wa the 11 months till the next book  the series comes out It  will be a long wa might as well read the series over aga =)
'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' takes a while to get gog but once  does you can't put  down The fact is that the book may sag occasionally but most of the time the book is wty smart excg   exotic  When I fished the book I found I needed the fthA Must-Read
The Goblet of Fire is the best book  the series of HarryPotter books It begs wh Harry Potter gog to the Quiddch WldCup  ends wh someone tragically dyg  Hogwarts School hosts the Triwizard Tournament wh two dfert schools: Dourmstrang  Beauxbatons  They have to go through three tasks to see who the wner is  The wner ws one thous Galleons JK Rowlg has wrten a masterpiece that nothg can compare  I doubt that I will ever see any book as eagerly anticipated as The Goblet of Fire had been!  I always compared my other fave books: The Golden Compass  The Subtle Kne to the Potter series  now Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire reigns supreme!  This book left me hungry f me Let's hope we don't have to wa too long f Harry Potter #5!
When I bought this book I was pleased to discover how long  was but when I started  I was dismayed to realize what easy readg  was  It starts as the others did wh Harry's le durg the summer  then  began the school year  This book spent a lot of time on the summer  activies but you'll have to read the book to fd out what those  activies are
This is a great book that I recomend to any harry potter fan  some just tryg to get a good book to curl up wh The book has not changed by the harry potter stardsHe still is friends wh ron  hermione The book has trestg occurences that makes ron feel he is  harrys shadow I  don't want to give to much away so I thk that this will be a great  success  beware one you start readg you are not gog to want to  stop!
Another masterpeice by Jk Rowlg The series just keepsgettg better  me addictive The wst part about them iswag f the next one to come out And just when you thk she couldn't wre a better book she comes back  does The book is amazg  I couldn't put  down until I was done It keeps you pretty busy wh 's 752 pages of awsome lerature
THIS IS AN AMAZING BOOK!  WAY TO GO JK ROWLING!AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!  AMAZING!
The Goblet of Fire is the best book  the series of Harry Potter booksJK Rowlg has wrten a masterpiece that nothg can compare  I doubt that I will ever see any book as eagerly anticipated as The Goblet of  Fire had been!   I always compared my other fave books:  The Golden  Compass  The Subtle Kne to the Potter series  now Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire reigns supreme!   This book left me hungry f me   Let's hope we don't have to wa too long f Harry Potter #5!
Wow! How long we've waed f the 4th Harry Potter!  I can tell you  was no dissapotment  After readg 's 734 pages  less than 48 hours I was already tryg pre-der book 5!  Even wh the crease  length  Rowlg still leaves you hungry f me magic!  As warned book 4 does get  darker wh the first deaths close to Harry (I REFUSE TO TELL! )   a  VERY close encounter wh You-Know-Who  JK Rowlg has certaly got me  under her spell!
I have read the other three Harry Potter books  I loved all of them  This book was no exception  The plot was very terestg  suspenseful  There are many twists that will keep you readg!  In this book Harry's  fight agast the evil dark wizard Voldemt contues  Many terestg  facts about Voldemt's past get revealed This was by far the most  &quotadult&quot iented book of the four Harry Potter books  But I  believe that  is appropriate f all ages  If this is your first  experience wh Harry Potter I would recommend readg the other three  books first  I thk you could enjoy readg this book  you had never  read another Harry Potter book but a lot of the references to past books  would be lost  However JK Rowlg does do a good job of  briefly  paraphrasg some of the maj events from the other books
JK Rowlg has exceeded my expectations  I was eagerly anticipatg readg me of Harry's adventures on the Quiddch field  scrapes wh danger as he contued his studies as Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry  However I was not disappoted to fd other players on the  Quiddch field  the book of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire My  level of uneasess grew as JKRowlg developed layer upon layer of  suspenseful episodes throughout Harry's fourth year  I was not prepared  f the twist of events that unfurled as Harry met students from other  wizardry schools  events confirmed his suspicions of familiar  acquatances  The tempo of encounters wh peril  you-know-who varied  just enough to keep me off guard  I rema  awe of JK Rowlg's  creative abily to draw readers to the magical wld at HogwartsMany  families have enjoyed previous Harry Potter books to read aloud together   JK Rowlg's art cleverly creates stressful environments  The Goblet of  Fire that may be too tense f some young readers  My family was  thrilled to read a book wh suspense tture mystery  death whout  the prolonged ge  gristly details geared toward the older reader   Parents will be sensive to their own children's emotional development   recognize that this book is f readg aloud after the ltle ones have  gone to bed
This is probably The most exg book  the series You will reread  millions of times jk rowlg did a great job
Even though Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is Rowlgs's longest book  is defately not the hardest to get through I raced through the book  3 days  found  amazg that a book that long could be so  quick Rowlg keeps throwg surprises at you  keeps the readers  guessg along wh the characters Even though the plot is along the same  les as the other two books I was surprised at what happened  the end  I strongly agree wh those who say that Rowlg has not lost her touch   I am ancious to fd out what happens to Harry  the 5th book
I started readg this book  didn't put  down until I had read all of  I love the characts the plot  the sty self Now  only there were a way to make book five magicaly appear!
Wow! This book is really good!  Don't let the number of pages stop you from buyg this books wth every wd sentece page  chapter! JK Rowlg gives plenty of despcription  makes the sty so  terestg that  makes you wanna keep turng the pages  fd out  whats gonna happen! This is a defe five stars!
A real nailber  A thrill by thrill book that will leave you on the edge of your seat till the very last page still have you screamg f me

This is a well-wrten masterpiece by J K Rowlg It is me detail-iented then the rest of the books focusg on hum  emotions which may be why the book is so long! I enjoyed every page It is well wth the time to read It is however me violent then the other books  I hope you enjoy this books as much as I did  GET IT NOW!
This book is just as good as the the previous ones Rowlg has done a great job yet aga at supplg suspence f all ages It keeps you turng the pages And whout realizg  you make your way through all 700  some pages a flash This is a wonderful book!
I'm a real Harry Potter fan (although I'm not a kid anyme) This book is a sequale of her previous books (of course) It's dferent from the first three books sce our Harry gets older  begs to be me emotional But  still  shouws a lovely friendship between Harry Hermione  Ron  Although they all grow up  beg to thk about boys  girls as  &quotboys  girls&quot their friendship  the carg f one another  is still be the same  this theme makes me happy all the time I read this  book Recommended!
It just keeps gettg better  better  Can't wa f Book 5 to come outThank you Ms Rowlg!
Although I didn't start readg the Harry Potter books until que some time after #3 was published I was immediately hooked!  I couldn't wa f #4 to be released  promptly snared a copy of  at the local bookste  It's just as good --  not better -- as the previous three books  At  Hogwarts School f Wchcraft  Wizardry Harry Ron  Hermione are  up to their usual adventures --  trouble -- on every page  The Fat  Lady's passwd at the start of the year is  just one of the  hillarious ltle touches throughout the book  It's a must-read f anyone  who loves Harry Potter!
I have been wag by my mail box sce I pre-dered this book from Amazon  In fact I reread the third book just to make sure I was up to date on what happened last time Usually when you anticipate somethg so much  can never live up to your expectations -- but this one went above   beyond  I could not sleep because of this book -- I had to know what was  gog to happen to Harry Ron  Hermoe  Once I got this book  was  dficult f me to put  down to go to wk  In this book you see that  Harry  his friends are growg up  Plus JK Rowlg gives us a few  me strs  the trict web she is weavg  One of the best parts of  this book is that we get to see almost everyone  a new light  some way   another  Another great feature  this book is new students from  other schools  Upon first se I was a ltle b timidated by the size  of the book -- over 700 pages but by the end I wanted at least 700 me  pages  I can't image that there is anybody who read the other books that  hasn't already ran out  bought this book -- but  you haven't you are  missg out!  The only problem wh this book is that once you fish   you will be askg &quotWHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMING OUT! &quot And from  what I underst that might be a really long time from now!
I thought this was a good book The book was que long  dragged out but very compellg  terestg The only thg I didn't really like was that they didn't spend enough time on the dialauge between RonHarry Hermoe Also My fave characters are Fred  Gege   they did not have a maj role  this book eher And there was no  quiddch!  Well enough wh the complats because this was a really  good book!  I loved   I recomend  to kids 8 to 80!  Thanks!  GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND THEIR FAMILIES!
We had to buy 2 copies so that my 9yo daughter  I each had a copy to read!  Neher of us put  down  although  was 740+ pages  was vtage Rowlg keepg us turng the pages  we both fished wh  48 hours of begng  (now we need to catch up on our sleep)  Our only  question is:  when is Book 5 comg out!  Harry  friends are at  their fest  the twists that come out should surprise  trigue the  followers of Harry  Wonderful wonderful readg  a treasure f our  library (okay 2 treasures!)
JK Rowlg has crafted her characters wh the greatest care  knows exactly how to hold our emotions  the palm of her h  This book is truly amazg  You must buy !
Just fished the book Rivetg The wst part of  is thewa f the next book Ouch! Rowlg took a page from Ld Voldy'sbook on cruelty  Still 's a wonderful piece of wk Very entertag It's spelled e-n-t-e-r-t-a-i-n-m-e-n-t -- check to --you might like  If anyone takes a wd of these books seriously than I've got a Blast-Ended Skrewt to sell ya
As a leracy educat I am  awe of Harry Potter  the effect he  his creat have had on readg f pleasure especially but certaly not exclusively f young readers I've spent a good deal of this past weekend  readg the fourth novel Harry Potter nad Goblet of Fire (professional  research you know)  I just have to say : She's done  aga! Rarely  does somethg that's had this much hype live up to s advance press but  this novel certaly does As a matter of fact this novel lives up to that  hype throughout s 700-plus pages Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was  an excg read f this old readg profess  promises to be even  me excg ( empowerg) f the younger readers among us Thanks  Jo You're makg my job a lot easier!
Rowlg does another great job  I was not disappoted after wag almost a year f this book She gives us a fourteen year old Harry that has grown emotionally  physically sce the last book  She has stayed  true to his character as a growg teenager  We get a lot me detail   this book hence the 734 pages  I enjoy the detail  appreciated  from  the auth  There is also me background fmation about all of the  characters  Some of the mysteries  the past are cleared up  you are  given a better understg of what happened durg the days of  You-Know-Who's power  why Harry is made to suffer at the Dursley's house  all summer  However she created me mystery f the future Rowlg  warned us that this book is darker that the past   is  However we  are startg to see Harry act like a teenager  the lighter moments of  beg a teenager outweigh the darker ones  We are given me of an sight  to the Weasley family  how they are a surrogate family f Harry  By  beg true to Harry Rowlg may be startg to lose some of her audience  Harry is a teenager  certa thgs come wh beg a teenager  I would  not recommend this book to anyone under ten  As a teacher some of the  suggestions that are made  this book I would not want my third graders  readg  Even though I know they will  I see this beg me of an issue   the future books when Harry is 15  16  There is enough of an endg  to close out the book  Rowlg is settg everythg up f the showdown  between good  evil that we have been beg prepared f sce the first  book  Rowlg leaves you hangg on the edge of your seat wantg to know  what happens next
One of the best Harry books so far She brgs back some of the best characters  troduces some me fun characters I love the fact that Harry  Ron had an argument  wked  out  how she showed how much Ron's friendship means to Harry She did a great job of dealg wh  Hagrid's dferences that would have darily made him scned  Harry  Ron  Hermones reaction to learng about Hagrid  what they said to  him One of the best Harry Potter books  one of the funniest Great f  the whole family
In her fourth pivotal book Rowlg has readers on the edge of their seats breathless as Harry dives to dangers on l  water  Seamlessly terwoven past characters like Sirius Wmtail  Voldemt reappearTwists  turns spells  hexes  treachery  trickery tertwe to leave the reader entangled  a book  he/she will struggle to put down!
I thk this the best book  the seriesIt's long weird funny It's hard to expla what I see  the Harry Potter books they're just cool
I could not put  down until I had fished   At the Quiddch Wld Cup the Death Sign  the march of the Death Eaters demonstrate that He Who Must Not Be Named is gag power  On returng to school Harry learns that there will be a Triwizard Tournament  An older student from  each of the three wizard schools will compete f the Triwizard Cup   Suddenly Harry fds himself  the middle of the competion  Who got  past the age le to enter his name?  Who was able to confound the Goblet  of Fire to trick  to a fourth contestant?  Evil is aloft
Like most fairy-tales the plotle of the fourth Harry Potter books is predictable (Harry goes to school confronts a mysterious evil) but that doesn't mean  isn't complex  that doesn't mean there are no  surprises  Book four is meant to be a culmation of the last 3 Potter  books a service  renders que nicely: Harry returns to Hogwarths wh  his dear friends ( enemies) f his fourth year  The legendary  Triwizard Tournaments is to take place  Harry fds himself an  unwillg contestant --  once aga also fds himself the epicenter of  an ongog battle between risg fces of evil  powerful fces of  goodRowlg has a tight control over the plot  just as imptantly  her imagation  The wld she has created is real enough f the  modern-day reader to empathize yet far-enough removed that the book seems  somethg like explation  a feign country  No detail -- the ty  spastic owl Pigwidgeon Dudley's fatness Fred  Gege's contued  antics -- fails to delight  Rowlg gives a nod to our social  sensibilies by expg the wld of wizardry to clude various  nationalies while Hermione armed wh badges  a cause embarks on  her own crusade to stamp out the wld's justice Rowlg gently remds  us too of the vulnerabily of young teenagers -- gawky boys discoverg  girls cheeky girls encounterg their own feelgs about love   friendshipHarry  his friends are growg up  There is death there  is evil  there are serious matters a-brew as Harry learns me  about his past we see that the lives of the various characters -- Harry  Ron Hermione Dumblede Snape Hagrid Draco Malfoy  Voldemt --  grow me tertwedHarry Potter is no longer just a boy  a book   a series -- he's a movement  And to miss out on this movement would be  a shame  The audience can rest assured that Rowlg has the sty under  control All that remas once the book is read is to reread  analyze   discuss  speculate  wa f the return of Harry Potter  Book  5  Readg  is only half the fun -- anticipation of what's to come is  the restonce the book is read is to reread  analyze   discuss  speculate  wa f the return of Harry Potter  Book  5  Readg  is only half the fun -- anticipation of what's to come is  the rest
I honestly thought that this book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire wouldn't meet up to all the hype  was gettg I thought  would drag out (I mean 752 pages!) the length just wouldn't wk I had no idea  the skill JK Rowlg has She took her characters  really added to their  le as wches  wizards They among other thgs went to see the  Quiddch Wld Cup which I found an excg addion  a part that  could even be a book self where the terr  trigue you always fd   a Harry Potter book started wh the return of the terrible Death  Eaters the followers of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named She described so vividly  their return  a way that sent hryg prickles down my spe the  same way the first chapter already brgg sudden deaths did But on a  lighter side even though evilk always stalks Hogwarts Harry Hermione   Ron did beg to grow up  found romance of sts where they'd least  expect     I don't want to give anythg away but the action  the  danger wh  was unbelievable Harry faces his greatest challenge yet   me ways then one No one is who you thk they are  no one can be  trusted A friend may not be  an enemy might change The endg was  troublg  left us wonderg what is to become of the not-so-perfect  le of the wizardg communy It left me wh an unsettled feelg that  somethg's just not right  left me wantg to know me But even as  secrets are left many are revealed The mystery of Herry's parents is  told  you learn somethg rather startlg about one of Harry's close  friends Neville Although this was certaly the darkest of all of her  books I feel Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was defely a success  If you read one book this summer I would defely recommend  to be  this one no matter how old you are This will appeal to kids  grown-ups  alike
Got the book on Saturday mid mng (thanks to the free FedEx update!)  could not put the book down once I started ! As the book says this is a pivotal year f Harry as a he matures que a b durg the course  of the book He learns me about his own past  as usual is subjected to  all kds of deals Just like books two  three this does not seem  like just a sequel but another part of a long saga The sty of Harry  Potter is a brilliantly woven tapestry wh long threads that span several  volumes Like any great book thgs start fallg to place as the book  progresses  everythg makes so much me sense Despe beg over 700  pages long (wow!) the book casts a spell on you from which you cannot  escape!
I opened the cover of Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire a b fearfully  Although my ne-year-old was simply vibratg wh excement I was wried What  this one wasn't as good as the first three?  What  JK  Rowlg was now simply wrg a book because she had to f contract  reasons not because she had a sty that had to be told?  Happily that is  not the case at all  this latest stallment  the Harry Potter saga  is fresh often exhilaratg  sure to please anyone who has come to love  the magic of Harry Hogwarts  all thgs that are not of the Mugglekd  That beg said even those wh no experience of the first three books  will fd  readable because Ms Rowlg offers up enough background to  make  understable yet whout disclosg too many of the secrets of  the first sties It almost lerally starts wh a bang as  Harry's  friends the Weasly's blast through a wall  the suburban house where Harry  lives wh his hopelessly muggle (non-magical) aunt uncle  cous From  that pot on havg to put this book down can be like havg to jump from  a movg car you just want to hold on until the ride is over!  There are  lots of terestg  funny details about the dferences between the  lestyles of the muggle  magical kd  From campg  a pup tent that  on the side actually is a one bedroom apartment complete wh mismatched  chairs  smellg of cats to practical jokes that volve cream tarts  that temparily turns the eater of one to a giant yellow canary!  There  is also Voldemt the Dark Ld  He who was so powerful  the dark arts   so evil that wizards  wches refer to him fearfully as  You-Know-Who even years after he had lost all his power  an attempt to  murder one year old Harry  Harry has had to do battle wh the Dark Ld   his mions a number of times sce that first attack that left a  lighteng shaped scare on his fehead  his parents dead  In The  Goblet of Fire the Dark Ld is back  he is stronger  me dangerous  than ever  Harry is older  wiser at fourteen but also prone to the  trials  tribulations of that age  A time fraught wh  misunderstgs a first crush self doubts mistakes  betrayals  This is reflected  the darker tone of the sty there are great  victies but there is also great loss  Ms Rowlg successfully carries  off this darker nature wh respect  care f both her characters   her readers This is a fantasy but  is also a mystery to respect that  there is much that should not be said   What can be said is that   will not disappot  There are all the necessary elements of wonder   close calls  plenty of humour  excement   leaves the reader  wh a promise of the adventures to come  It is a good book f older  kids eight  ne  up  f adults too  It is an especially good  book f a child  adult to shareGoblet of Fire the Dark Ld is back  he is stronger  me dangerous  than ever  Harry is older  wiser at fourteen but also prone to the  trials  tribulations of that age  A time fraught wh  misunderstgs a first crush self doubts mistakes  betrayals  This is reflected  the darker tone of the sty there are great  victies but there is also great loss  Ms Rowlg successfully carries  off this darker nature wh respect  care f both her characters   her readers This is a fantasy but  is also a mystery to respect that  there is much that should not be said   What can be said is that   will not disappot  There are all the necessary elements of wonder   close calls  plenty of humour  excement   leaves the reader  wh a promise of the adventures to come  It is a good book f older  kids eight  ne  up  f adults too  It is an especially good  book f a child  adult to share
This book sure keeps you on your toes!  You don't know what is gog to happen next   someone is good  evil And I am sure all of us are wonderg who is gog to die an WHEN?  It is a lot darker  a b  scary but  fs  so well wh the sty  so the book would not be  complete whout some mystery  JKRowlg really did a great job of  showg that yes Harry is a boy  that he is growg upIf someone  hasn't read  yet I sugest checkg their temperture  pulse  Because  NO ONE can let their imangation miss out on this feast of a great series
This is the best book  the Harry Potter series If you thought the other books were great I guarantee you that this one is better This is probably one of the best books I've ever read! So  I like  I can guarantee  that you'll like  as well!
In this book JK Rowlg has fally unveiled the complete wld of Hogwarts  every riotous headlong detail She has wrten another great adventure of Harry Potter's as  is wrten  the book about the summer holidays which are draggg on  he can't wa f the start of the  school year It is yet the fourth book  Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts  School of Wchcraft  Wizardy He is much lookg fward to this year  of excg spells which are to be learnt  lessons to be attended  Although Harry is expectg these other que unexpected events are on the  march This book is like a contuation to an unfished excg   thrillg sty as from the very first day Harry was bn  how he  suffered livg wh his aunt  uncle until he was accepted to  Hogwarts He had his ups  downs but certaly had a lot of adventure at  Hogwarts Now after much awag the sty of Harry's fourth year at  Hogwarts has certaly arrived It was wth the wa   is now wth  readg
This book like all the others entrances you wh 's sudden twists  turns so that you don't know who is an who isn't a tra Also JK Rowlg throws small hts at you even  the name of the first chapter(The  Riddle house  anyone that has read The Chamber of Secrets knows that  Ld Voldermt  his father were named Tom Riddle)that many people  overlook  they say &quotHey that came out of nowhere!&quot And I  just tell them to read  aga This is a great book f people of all  ages
I sat down wh this book the moment I got   devoured   one weekend   was time well spent Harry  his pals are adolescents now  the awkwardness of crushes  school dances rgs true to the  reader's experience The book is as packed wh adventure as all the  others  the end is even me thrillg  a clf-hanger to lead us   to Book 5 Wre faster Ms Rowlg!
This volume held all the charm  w of previous Harry Potter novels but  also adds me depth  emotion as plots that have been buildg throughout the series thicken  become even me serious  It was  entertag amusg maddeng  - dare I adm ? - I even shed a  few tears I couldn't put  down! I loved   I can't wa f book  five!
Havg read all of the four Harry Potter books I highly recommend this series to people of all ages These novels have noticeably creased kid's terest  readg (as well as adults!) because of the sheer enjoyment of  these episodes Wh Harry Potter as the darg star of the series he  along wh numerous friends  foes create excg trigug   heartwarmg journeys wh the turn of each page The fourth book of this  sequence adds another adventuresome year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry wh Harry Potter comg once aga face to face wh Ld  Voldemt Harry has his hs full once aga  book four most  particularly because You-Know-Who is now back wh full power  ready to  rega his dark supremacy Grab the newest book today ( the rest of the  series too!)  start readg  you won't regret !
Even  you haven't read books 1-3 Rowlg does a nice job of explag the past whout gog to tedious detail  This one's defely darker than the first 3 so watch the appropriateness f ltle ones  Typical of  Rowlg this book has creative twists  turns that make  a defe  page turner  My husb  I bought two books but only one came on  Saturday so we ended up fightg over the one that did arrive  Enjoy!
I am 30 years old  I must say this book is one of the best books I have read  my le Simply amazg this book is Very dark  deadly  brgs back Harry Potter series to square one You will know what I meant  after you read  JK Rowlg has out done herself  this book wh  unfgetable characters  sister plot Me  me her wrg is  maturg  so are the characters I would say this series is no longer a  children's but a full blown Myster/Suspense/Hr book that one would  expect from Dean Koontz  Stephen Kg Thk twice befe you read this  book to kids under 12 years old Nevertheless very entertag   utterly fulfillg Harry Potter V will sell 10 million HB next year
I was only recently troduced to the wld of JK Rowlg's Harry Potter books A wonderful friend who happens to be a 3rd  4th-grade teacher convced me to put down my usually me adult pursus f a change of  pace  the Harry Potter  the Scer's Stone I was stantly enamed  wh the simple yet crisp dialogue The first 3 books were extremely quick  reads yet they don't feel the least b disposable Even though I had only  started wh the books a month ago I felt totally immersed so I ( my  friend) eagerly awaed the new 4th book  the series Rowlg noted that  this book would be darker than the others cludg an actual death  one  of s chapters albe to a rather peripheral character This  addion  to the revelation that Goblet of Fire would be longer than 700 pages may  have scared some away but most of the plot threads are very engrossg  compellg   the end necessary to move the series away from  potentially becomg fmulaicAs I read most of the book on a public  beach I found numerous people askg me what the dferences were between  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  the previous books I explaed the  relative lack of Quiddch action at which pot I also mentioned the fact  that &quotthere are plenty of other types of action to keep your  attention&quot  Most readers can see certa threads developg as the  ma characters (Harry Ron Hermione) become older  me mature  (teenagers) so 's nice to see the characters grow wh many of the  readg audience It was nice to see less of the Dursleys the Muggle  family who raised Harry because they were rather one-dimensional   predictable Profess Dumblede's role becomes me  me clear as do  the roles of some of the other Professs However there is a b of fat   the sty that could be cut A sub-plot volvg house-elves never  really generated steam The polical crectness of  felt a b out of  place The Quiddch action here isn't que as captivatg as  was   Prisoner of Azkaban  In the end a very satisfyg read though  took  about twice as long Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire answers que a  few questions but poses so many me It is a ftg midpot f the  series  dutully sets up the remag 3 (accdg to Rowlg) books  It wks along the same les as a certa episode  the Star Wars series  However I would not recommend jumpg straight to Goblet of Fire whout  readg the first 3 books as readers of the entire will be richly rewarded  wh the various references  nods  GoFf  place The Quiddch action here isn't que as captivatg as  was   Prisoner of Azkaban  In the end a very satisfyg read though  took  about twice as long Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire answers que a  few questions but poses so many me It is a ftg midpot f the  series  dutully sets up the remag 3 (accdg to Rowlg) books  It wks along the same les as a certa episode  the Star Wars series  However I would not recommend jumpg straight to Goblet of Fire whout  readg the first 3 books as readers of the entire will be richly rewarded  wh the various references  nods  GoF

I got this book today  have already fished !  I started   could not stop!  Anyone who has somethg bad to say about the book is out of their md!  They just can't hle is populary! The book starts off  wh the Quiddch Wld Cup (I wont give the entire book away that way  you can enjoy  as much as I have!)  ends wh a dramatic conclusion!  Put everythg aside  your le  read this book I know  will be the  best book you have ever read!  Congrats to JK Rowlg!  Keep up the  good wk  I cant wa until the next book!Chris Carlson
I absolutly loved this book!  It had a lot of suspense action  a perfect amount of romance  A bbok f adults  kids alike!   I thk JK Rowlg really captured all the details perfectly  It's almost as  your livg the book!  I recommend this book to anyone
While this is meant to be a childrens book It like all the others  the Harry Potter series are f all ages I haven't be a kid  many years but this book  all the rest brg out the child  me I got my book on  Saturday afternoon  couldn't put  down I would have to say that  is  one of my faves  the series It has all the wonderful suspense the  makes books fun to read
Wow I can tell you this is a great book! If you have read any of the other HP books this will brg just as much joy to your le as the last 3 The begg starts off a ltle slow because wellsce  is the  &quotmiddle&quot of the set JKR wanted  to st out  be a ltle  dferent Near the middle of the book you have come across the 'Triwizard  Tournament'(Which I thk the book should have been called) The  Triwizard Tournament is a tournament of events agast dulg wizardg  schoolsYou will probably notice some of those ltle &quotcrushes&quot  gog on In the HP wld there seems to be a nice &quotlove  Hexagon&quot gog onYes that many people! Now later on I must say the  endg is wonderful! Even the begg of the end is wonderful  's  scary sta way Overall  was a great book but I would reccomend  to  anybody over 10 I give  this because JKR seemed to have used swears a  ltle me  this book not to mention a rather funny sick joke made my  Ron(hehe's not that sick) Plus the endg might freak ltle kids  out becausewell I can't tell you! That would give away the sty! And   you want to fd out how great the endg is go read !
A richly conceived clever tale a wthy entry to the leage of fantasy wks by auths such as JRR Tolkien Ursula Le Gu  Madelee L'Engle  While this may be a book specically wrten f young adults   is certaly well-crafted enough to engage imagative readers of any  age
Rowlgs has out done herself yet aga  I thk that Goblet of Fire is by far the best  her series The plot was tight  had me guessg until the very end  Her newly troduced characters were a delight as  were the friends I had come to know  the first three books She took my  33 year old bra back 20 years to a place where all thgs were possible   where good prevails  the end  I read all 734 pages  just under 13  hours  my only complat is that the book wasn't enchanted to keep  gog  gog  I will just have to wa wh an eager md f year 5  to be published  loose myself  Hogwarts yet aga
JK Rowlg has proved once aga that she can create magic of her own! This crucial 4th book  the Harry Potter series has been wth the wa!  Included  this fast-paced tale that will prevent you from puttg the  book down are many key elements cludg several questions from previous  books that will fally be answered  There are also many new  excg  revelations!  Harry is growg up  this book  as he  his  friends change so does the tellg of his adventures  Rowlg's books  progress wh each volume  this one is no exception  The readg is  me dficult as well as a b me mature  Younger readers may need  their parents to review this material befe readg  themselves  There  is some mature language  references  there are also detailed  descriptions of death  violence  This book will tug your emotions  through laughter  even tears wh the end result leavg you wantg  me me me!  Read &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  then read   aga!
I thought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great book because I found  wasn't as far-fetched  spooky as the 2nd Harry Potter book The Chamber of Secrets -- although there is some danger    I liked the  fact that certa characters cludg James  Lilly Potter   Wmtail returned  the fourth book  It is a  suspensful book  has  very humous parts too  Even though Harry has a secret crush  doesn't  get all mushy  It is my fave of the four Harry Potter books
Harry PotterThe Goblet of Fire is just another awesomeaddion to JKRowlg's series I'm really at a loss f wds toexpla how excg  heartwrenchg the sty got  how I clung to every sgle wd  how  kept me on my toes  I admire the way Rowlg contues to surprise her audiencethere were many times I was sure I had the sty figured out wh who the culprs were  how thgs would turn out but JKRowlg just added many new twists to this fourth book  I like the way Harry's character stays well grounded How even as famous as he is he has his share of humblg experiences such as his love le beg the object of ridicule  gossip His courage is really put to the testwhich reveals how truly special he is This book really ties  all four books full of adventure suspense  unprecedented surprises I'm already readg  a second time  lookg fward to the fth book  this series
It is hard to put to wds what I thk about this book  I don't thk I've ever stayed up until 20 to 4 to fish a book befe but fish  I did  the result was an terestg combation of emotions  Wh her  monster of a novel breakg sales recds all over the wld JK Rowlg  has created a novel  which the ends don't get tied up to a neat ltle  package  This one is dferent Don't get me wrong that is not a bad  thg  This book still has the endearg characters the hilarious  one-lers  the grippg sty les that made the first three books   the series so wonderful  But the darker side to Harry's wld becomes far  me apparent  this one  You beg to question whether Harry will  contue to escape danger  defeat evil  I f one began to fear f  the lives of my favoure characters  It is so unusual to fd this st  of emotion  a children's book  yet the children will still read   And so will the adults  This book is full of fun adventure suspense  humour  me of the ltle tidbs of fmation about the wizardg  wld that now characterizes Rowlg's novels  We see familiar faces   meet some new ones  But there is much me than that  Harry now faces  death fear pa  evil unlike any he has ever faced befe  But  thanks to the unstoppable wrg of Rowlg he manages to face his  challenges wh the same courage  strength that we have come to expect  from our beloved Harry
I thought that this book was even better than the other three harry potter books but ltler kids might not like  as much(I'm thirteen)  deals wh some pretty serious stuff like prejudice death nosy repters who will twist anythg you say around f a styReaders  beware do not start this book  you do not tend to fish  you will  never sleep aga(No I did not mean to quote Jumangi) What I meant by that  was yes this book is just as captivatg  not me so  than 's  predecesssThat's all folks!
This fourth book of the Harry Potter series was absolutely fantastic f about the first 400 pages  The book seemed to start draggg a b  third quarter  The sty came to a screechg halt at one of the most  tense moments when the villa summarized the sty so far as  he was   a &quotB&quot movie  Otherwise this has everythg a Potter could hope  f  me!  It even has an endg that will make the reader crave the  fth book!  Great job!
JK Rowlg's fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series may be long but the sty needs to be told slowly   detail Described  terviews as the &quotpivotal 4th book&quot the novel proves that  description to be an understatement Although at times I wondered   anythg maj was ever gog to happen I knew that Rowlg was  meticulously settg up her readers f somethg unexpected to occur at  some crical pot It does The pace of the book may be slower than that  of the first three  the series but throughout I kept wonderg who the  evil ones truly were  how the book was gog to end which contributed  to  beg a page-turner nonetheless &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot reads  me like a good mystery novel rather than an enchantg children's  fantasy And well  should: Harry is growg up  becomg me  me  aware of the realy of his le  the wld of wizardry Therefe the  style  themes are somewhat me mature Towards the end the book does  turn frighteng  younger readers may have trouble sleepg at night  However the maj turng pot  the book is cleverly timed as  comes  upon you whout warng It did scare  shock me When I closed the back  cover at last I most certaly found myself eagerly lookg fward to  Year Five of Harry Potter's school career Well done aga Ms Rowlg   spe of what some crics may say your books have much to say about  society right  wrong  good  evil
The newest stallment of Harry Potter is defetly the best of the now four It is darker than the first three but even me thrillg All  all this book is superb
As sequels come  go--this one was one of the best So good I fished most of  the night  came  the mail The most strikg thg about  is s darkness There is of course the hum  clever bs that are  synonimous wh the name JK Rowlg  yet there is a side which  sobered me  made me thk--as only Heller Tolstoy Hardy  wrers  of that ilk can So I guess  a way JK Rowlg has joed their  ranks Kudos to her! Not only does she pack  a rollickg sty she  manages to tell a sty of mals whout soundg like a mister  It  did however make me very misty-eyed at times but read  everybody  should--both the young  old As old Dumblede himself explaed  &quotthey thk I should not tell you so young as you are It is my  belief however that the truth is generally perferable to lies&quot
In Harry Potter 4 JK Rowlg goes above  beyond her previous level of expertice  Instead of havg only a sgle maj climax at the end of the book there is an excg event  every chapter  Also the magical  creatures are devoloped me than they were  the other books  Altogether  an excg  entertag sty
I approached Harry Potter #4 wh much excment  some trepedation  Would  be as wonderful as the first three?  Thankfully  just about wasMy 'just about' comes f a number of reasons  This novel had all  the colful characters  entertag wds that we have come to expect  from JK Rowlg  Too the challenges Harry  his friends face are  refreshgly igal  We get to learn me about the other characters of  the school cludg Hagrid  Snape  We also get to meet other wizards   wches Harry's age who are as terestg as they are  uniqueUnftunately we have to hear all about how Harry became a  wizard  who his awful family is f the fourth time  countg  Rowlg should take a ht from Anne McCaffrey  clude a prologue f  those few people who are readg number four ( five  six) befe havg  read the first novels  That way those of us who have read the same histy  over  over aga could fally just skip This fourth  a series  of seven books seems to have leaned me towards sci-fi at the end  No  longer are all the characters seemgly immtal  Also Rowlg has  pated a darker picture that may disturb younger readers  Voldemt   the acts he engages  are rather disturbg  they leave us wh no  doubt that  the future Rowlg will be mixg  some me of this  darknessOn a lighter note I must say that while I thought I had  everythg all figured out Rowlg suprised me yet aga wh her creative  conclusion (which I should have suspected but never did)So I loved  this book but I fear that the size  overall darkness prevelant towards  the end will be a b overwhelmg f some children  The character  development is superb  Rowlg's abily to expla thgs that I never  thought to question is delightful
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series is another sure page turner Once aga JK Rowlg's exceptional characterization is consistent  true to the dividuals  her sty You can see the growth  each of the players The sub-plots are weaved ever so cleverly through the book  that you can't put  down! A highly recommended read
This book completely lived up to the stards set by the firstthree  I don't thk you could give  a higher compliment!
If JK Rowlg could put out one of these books every week I would be among the millions of people who would be delighted  We waed f a long time f No 4   didn't disappot f a mute  In fact I thk   is probably the best  most satisfyg ( longest which makes the  experience last longer  longer) of the four so far  This one has Harry  Potter facg dangers beyond anythg that he has faced befe  the  endg is one of such marvelous wonder that  brought tears to my eyes  I'm not  the 9-12 readg range I'm far older than that but I've  devoured all four Harry Potter books so far  I know I'm not the only  above-age Muggle to have done so because surely there were not 5 million  9-12 year olds to snap up the first prtg of this one  Should you be  one of those who have refraed from readg the series because you don't  run along wh the pack  go run wh the pack this time because 's  surely wth   JK Rowlg wres wh an assured touch that is beyond  any complat  The characters are beautully drawn the suations are  ones which make you wish that you too could be a wizard  at least a  house-elf  half-giant  all I can say is that I cannot cannot cannot  wa f the fth  what the auth says will be seven books  this  series  after the seventh one is out (I hope soon) I hope she will  change her md  wre as many after-the-seventh books as Barbra  Streis has had &quotlast-of-the-career&quot concerts  Thank you Ms  Rowlg -- thank you thank you thank you!
The fourth book  the series Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far the best Harry yet Beg 734 pages  seems like  will never end But when you fish readg the last page you won't stop thkg about  the thgs  the book f days The book troduces somethg that  replaces Quiddch at Hogwarts f this particular year  replaces   wh a special event that hasn't happened f a hundred years You'll have  to read the book to fd out :) The Goblet of Fire is exactly what   sounds like except the flames are blue  at times change to red Its  purpose surprised me  as  will probably do to you Although darker   parts than the other books (this book troduces the Unfgivable  Curses-pretty self explanaty what they are)  has a ball   (as   dancg ball) Harry's actions toward Proffes Trelawney are que funny   a small character from the second book returns Buy this book  you  won't regret !
As a 20 year old fan of Potter I have to say that Rowlg has outdone herself  I laughed at the begng cried at the end was mesmerized throughout!  Honestly the book may be a ltle dark f younger Potter  fans especially those wh really active  really good imagations  The characters have also started usg the &quotd&quot wd  But the  sty is truly amazg  enchantg  I'm convced that Rowlg is a  wch herself that casts a spell on every copy makg the reader  ABSOLUTELY UNABLE TO PUT IT DOWN!  :-)  I've never read 200 pages of a  book at one stg befe I recommend this book to any Potter reader but  feel that the first 3 books should be read befeh  might be read by  parents to their younger Potter readers
I got the fourth book the day  came outThat special delivery thgI started readg  right away  I was hookedI could'nt stop readg This book is full of hum  suspenseI read from mng to nightI highly recommend this book to everybody especially kidsIt'll make them  want to keep readg all day longMy mom bought this book f me  I was  so glad my mom got  f meI can't wa f the other Harry Potter books  comg soon  I'm defetly buyg them from Amazonbecause you save a  lot of moneyThis book was just greeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaat!All kids should  own this!
Harry Potter Book 4 was like returng to old friends  A must read I couldn't put the book down JK Rowlg keeps the excement gog  each credible chapter
Harry Potter is maturg  so is the tone of JK Rowlgs' books  The fourth book  the Harry Potter series is an excellent read but 's a b darker  places than the previous threeIt's also a good deal longer --  over 750 pagesThe central event of this book is a magcial tournament  that takes place between three rival schools of magic: Hogwarts (of  course) Beauxbatons  the somewhat sister DurmstrangIn the  meantime evil dogs are afoot both wh Hogwarts  the Mistry of  MagicThere's really no question that Harry will survive the book   go on to star  books 5-7 but how you get there is most of the fun  JK  Rowlg manages once aga to tell a completely engrossg sty that is at  once movg terryg  upltg
much better than all the other hp books goblet of fire is atthe top of my listI fished   less than 3 days  was so good!
I adm  - I'm a grmother who is hooked on Harry Potter books  proud of The latest entry is the most complex  best yet I stayed up until 2 am to fish this book because  kept me on the edge of my  seat until the very endRowlg's mixture of the mundane  fantastic  keeps you guessg all time Its this same terweavg of plot elements  that make you love these books  Both adults  children can relate to  Harry Ron  Hermione  As an adult these books brg back to me a lot  of the feelgs I had as a child when there were so many thgs about the  adult wld that I didn't underst so that they seemed like magic to meI especially appreciate the fact that Rowlg doesn't sugar coat  anythg  Not everythg  childhood is sweetness  light  this book  has a btersweet endg that reflects thatI can't wa f the next  stallment myself  my grchildren can defely look fward be  beg the recipients of the entire series books
Unftunately the fourth book  the Harry Potter series proves a big disappotment after the wonderful first 3 novels  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is overlong lackg the tight plot of Rowlg's other  attempts Rowlg cuts sht some of the most comical moments  the other  books Harry's summers wh the Dursleys to make room f her lengthy  descriptions of seemgly never-endg tournaments (first the Quiddch  Wld Cup then the Triwizard Tournament)  Rowlg tries to show Harry   his friends as they move through adolescence attemptg to deal wh their  parents as well as their first crushes however any pre-teen novel out  there does  better  While I enjoyed readg the book out of love f  the characters we can only hope that the 5th novel  the series provides  us wh the cunng plot  wty commentary we came to know  love   the first 3 novels of the series
As an adult who has really enjoyed the previous Harry Potter books I was eagerly awag the fourth stallment I had heard the book was 700 pages but when I actually saw how thick  is my heart kd of sank I thought  there was no way she could &quotkeep  gog&quot f that long I am  pleased to say that I was wrong! This was as always an entertag read  It also was not what anyone expected I thk I wouldn't want to spoil the  surprise but suffice  to say that Harry fans will not be disappoted   will keep turng pages eagerly until the end  The sty moves along  at a great pace  is just fascatg And I was very surprised by what  happened!  I can't wa f #5!  I guess I will have to bide my time  rereadg 1-4!
Harry's did  aga Wh his fourth year i'm only page 262 BUT-i can already tell waht this kd of book this is ganna be! Harry's already gone to the quddictch wld cup thak's to the weasley family  you fnaly get  to meet Charlie &amp Bill ron's other 2 brothers! At hogwarts there havg  a ltle surprise the quddch rounds will NOT take place this year BUT  theve changed the rules about a toun-can't tell you read to fd out!
In the fourth of the creasgly lengthy Harry Potter books Rowlg gives us a global twist Wh thrillg action begng at the Quiddch Wld cup  contug durg the dangerous Triwizard Tournament we at  last get to see a b of the wizardg wld beyond the walls of Hogwarts  The view is not a dissappotment  You-Know-Who is back  me evil  then ever-keepg readers on the edge of their seats through all 734 (!)  pages Our fave characters are growg up  the romance quotant  though low-key adds a new spark as well Expect to fd some terrestg  fmation about everyone's fave groundkeeper  a certa escaped  convict will return to be part of the action The book is a turng pot   the series  f Harry Potter the excement the danger  the  stakes have never been higher
I absolutely loved this book!  It had a lot of suspense action  a perfect amount of romance  A book f adults  kids alike!  I thk JK Rowlg really captured all the details perfectly  It's almost as  your livg the book!  I recommend this book to anyone
The first three Potter books are self-contaed each could be read wh enjoyment whout havg read the others That is not true of the fourth book Goblet of Fire what Rowlg has called the 'pivotal book'  her  seven book series This is no loss to Potter fans Indeed Rowlg assumes  her readers have an easy familary wh the first books (the characters  the scenes the drama even specic curses  potions) is able  consequently to wre a book of greater depth excement  edication  than the first threeA la the Brothers Karamazov Rowlg's lead trio of  Harry Hermione  Ron represent the three faculties of soul: spir  md  body The first three Potter books are the tegration of these  faculties  the good Their friendship as the perfectly fmed soul   le by the wld is fged by trials failures  victies  the  struggle wh evil The success of the books has as much to do wh the  identication each reader has wh this universal experience as wh  Rowlg's unique w  sty tellg skillsIn the fourth book this  lovg try has matured enough to beg s heroic journey to the  valley of darkness I assume this journey will last the remag three  books  end wh the victy of the whe hats (Albus Dumblede) the  salvation of Neville Longbottom (the character who will be transfmed from  a toad to a wld beater by the sacricial love of his three friends) Not  sce Dickens has an auth  English  the guise of a comic novel   fantasy lerature ('children's books')wrten a wk that because of s  un-realy so successfully engages  transfms f the better the reader  wh s ptrayal of what is most real: love loyalty courage  friendship  the danger of the absence of these virtues  all those who  choose death ('Vol-de-mt')over le These are the most implicly   subtle Christian novels sce the Narnia books ( perhaps because of the  auth's much me subtle use of Christian imagery  theology)they are  me successful than Lewis' wk both  the bookstes   souls  immunized to the fah of ChristiansTo end: An altogether wonderful  read I urge all parents to share aloud wh their children  friends  me edyg than a Sunday vis to most places of congregational wship   a whole lot me funf the  auth's much me subtle use of Christian imagery  theology)they are  me successful than Lewis' wk both  the bookstes   souls  immunized to the fah of ChristiansTo end: An altogether wonderful  read I urge all parents to share aloud wh their children  friends  me edyg than a Sunday vis to most places of congregational wship   a whole lot me fun
Even as an adult reader I found all of the Harry Potter books to be the most satisfyg reads  many years  After my second readg of the previous three stallments I was me than exced f the release of  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  Once aga JK Rowlg has exceeded my  expectations!  Me than twice as long as any of the previous books #4  goes to much greater detail about the background of Harry  Ld  VoldemtIt is easy to tell that Harry is gettg older  this book  The sty le deals wh me adolescent issues like noticg girls   the first crushAs a teacher I am exced to see a book (series)  brgg so many children back to readg!
I'm a 38 year-old reader  I had to get THE BOOK (1245 am Saturday on my reciept) right away Read  through- I won't give away the details- yet  lived up to the hype! All parents  adults who read this  haven't  yet got to the series themselves start wh book 1  read them   der you can't go wrong wh Harry!
Harry Potter's 4th year is the best one yet! Just as thrillg  imagative as the previous three books Goblet of Fire fleshes out the ma characters  troduces new ones! I loved the exped role given  to Hermione  the entire Weasley family There's me drama  this one  than  the previos but 's all very plausible  described wh care   detail The wa f this was defely wth !
I Love this book but I am sure that the authess had a Disneyfied ghost wrer to help her wh the wrg process  I immediately noticed that the pacg of the book is much quicker than the igal three books about  Harry Potter lots me Spielburgish special effects comg at you on every  page  Also the tone of the book has changes every so slightly to a me  &quotaction figure&quot script  I suppose the auth has to make money  just like everyone else but I am a ltle disappoted though the qualy  of the wrg remas top notch
Harry Potter's contug journey to manhood  Book 4 is Rowlg's most detailed canvas yet  She pats a me richly-coled wld  which the characters which we have come to know  love reveal much me about  themselves ( others reveal about them - a new character a Hedda  Hopper-like journalist who has a penchant f trashg her subjects) as a  result of which we are all better prepared f the evable conflicts to  come  We get to know the Weasleys better than ever imptant facts about  Dumblede Snape the Death Eaters Voldemt  others are revealed   woven me deeply to the fabric of the le of Harry Potter  his  growg up  The book is long only because the sty is richly detailed  The details are essential I am sure not only f the plot  Book 4 but  as a foundation f the last three sties  Long however does not mean  bg     fact the oppose  Harry's latest year at Hogwarts is his  most challengg yet  The book champions teamwk loyalty mal fiber  self-sacrice  courage  A wonderful book that deserves quiet  reflection from s readers  a me slowly paced re-read
I'm an 11-year-old that just fished Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire last night  It's the best one yet!  It is so good I shouldn't to spoil  f you by tellg you just one sentence about   It is wth every cent!  OK all right I'll tell you about SOME of the book  Hermione starts a  b of people who want to make house-elfs (yeah elfs not elves) paid   The house-elfs don't like that though  If you are not sure what a  house-elf is thk of Dobby :)I really thk that the new Defense  Agast the Dark Arts teacher is as good as Lup  His name is  &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody  he has a magical eye  Harry enters the  Triwizard Tournament  which many past wizards  wches had died   Those are just a few of the many many great thgs that happen  this  734-page book!
This is defately the best Potter book yet People who were afraid that Goblet of Fire would be commercialized have nothg to wry about  Ms Rowlg has filled the fourth book wh yet me amazg magical escapades  f Harry  his friends  While  is possible to read this one whout  havg read the other three  would be much me enjoyable to read the  others first  I can't wa f number 5 to come out!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot has been a phenomenon well befe s release  July 8 Wrg this personal review after fishg the book on July 10 I believe that the people that spoke about  &quotcommercial hype&quot must be realizg their mistake when confronted  wh the realy of Ms Rowlg wk Harry Potter books sell not by virtue  of advertisg  marketg but because they are simply excellent  the  auth does her job whout concessions to fame  to expectations The  result is a powerful wk that can be read at multiple levelsIn  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot we not only see Harry Potter volved   old activies  new teenage terests described wh plenty of  imagation  hum We are also made aware that his call  desty  only started the day that he  his mother defeated Voldemt There is  still a long way to go f Harry me dangerous  complex as time goes  by a way  which he will likely grow  wisdom  comprehension And he  will not be alone  that path  this book the figures of Ron Hermione  Dumblede Hagrid  so many others become me fundamental  close  Harry is not a solary hero he is  fact the center of a communy full  of ethical values frienship  heart-warmg solidary A wld  confronted wh evils that are somehow the mirr image of some troubles on  our day to day wldThe reader of all ages will fd material f fun   though on this book a classic on s own beyond any lerary cric
Don't hesate to buy this because of the length  Each page is as enjoyable as the last as Harry fds his way to face the evable  The sty does deed start to tap to the romantic side but doesn't go too  far  Most of the focus is on the Triwizard Tournament held among three of  the ternational wizard schools  all the action leadg up to   around   F readers of the other 3 all of our faves are there   startg to grow up just a b  Even  you haven't read the others this  is nonetheless a joyful read
In my opion the newest novel  JK Rowlg's seven-book Harry Potter series is her best wk yet  Harry Ron  Hermione are  their fourth year at Hogwarts  facg many new  excg challenges cludg the  Triwizard Tournament a competion between three schools of magic that  hasn't occurred f over a century  The characters  the novel were me  believable than  the past three books  the plot was much me  entertag wh lots of twists  turns that keep the reader on the  edge of their seat  Although this book wasn't as cheerful  lighthearted  as the first  second books  was still funny  immensely enjoyable   Anyone who liked Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban won't be  disappoted
I had my doubts about the new Harry Potter book but  lived up to every expectation that I had  The characters are rich  thought provokg the plots are excg  unexpected  I can't wa until the next book
I doubt  Harry Potter needs any troduction to anyone readg these reviews  However this book takes a decidedly dferent course from the three which preceeded   To be true  does reta both the hum   charm of s predecesss  In fact  anythg  contas me than  they did--but then  had better sce this book is easily twice as long  It didn't seem twice as long  The pages nearly seemed to turn themselves  as I read wag f the other shoe to drop  the dark twists to beg  There was me than enough excement adventure  yes character  development to keep me gog  True there are hts that somethg ev  this way comes but Ms Rowlg is far too clever a wrer to let us off  easily  Goblet of Fire contas far  away her best wrg yet  I just  hope she can somehow avoid the You-Know-Who's of this wld long enough to  fish the Harry Potter saga    I need that fth book now!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire me than lived up to all the hype surroundg s release It took me back to the wld that I grew to love  the first three books  It was long but never never bg  It was  darker than the first 3 but  had to be to get where the next book will  start  I had my nose buried  the book all day  well to the early  mng  I was compelled to fish   The plotle was very excg but  I am not gog to reveal anythg about  f the sake of preservg the  effect f other readers  It was a very very good read  I cannot wa  until the next one comes out
Last night I fished readg my copy of the fourth stallment of Harry Potter  It arrived from FedEx saturday afternoonall 734 pages of   That's right I fished  last night Monday night  This book was so  engrossg that I lerally couldn't put  down  I was wried about this  book  I thought that wh all of the recent hype surroundg the series  that JK Rowlg would stray from the fmula that made Harry Potter a  household name  To my great pleasure this fourth stallment is just as  cleverly wrten as the first three  The characters are maturg befe  our eyes  the adventures are just as excg  nerve-rackg as ever   Pleaseread this book  sav  as much as I did  I am now  anxiously awag the fth stallment )
Harry Potter flies aga!  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a marvelously plotted superbly wrten book  Once aga Rowlg has taken us to her tricately built alternate wld  futher developg the characters  advancg toward the ultimate showdown between the powers of  good  evil  Harry Hermione Ron  the whole Hogswart crew are now  young adults wh all that entails:  pimples defyg authy   (gasp!) noticg the oppose sex  There is a hilarious chapter wh  ltle magic but many keen observations on just how a group of adolescent  wizards might pair up f their first dance  Number 4 is darker  tone  than the first three books Harry must realize that adults cannot solve all  problems that danger failure  death may be the consequence of  challengg evil  Wth stayg up all night to read!
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series is a turng pot  Twice as long as any of the previous books &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot ends Harry's 'childhood'  begs his transfmation to a full-grown  wizardThere are of course all the elements that have made the series  so popular - a wild vivid imagation breathtakg action  delicious  tongue  cheek  However this stallment is darker me serious  We  watch Harry mature right befe our eyesI will not spoil any of the  plot elements but know that f every question that is answered two me  are askedThis is a rollickg rollg rollercoaster of a ride!
This was the best book  the Harry Potter series so far! JK Rowlg keeps her magic comg  this book A good read hardly seems 700+ pages I hope you fd this review helpful!
Don't let the number of pages timidate you You'll be done befe you know   wishg f me Illustrations characters  plot all met my very high expectations The end though never welcome is satisfyg  Not just f kids- I'm 29  eagerly urgg Scholastic to hire a maid   cook f Ms Rowlgs so she can s  wre  wre  wre   wre  wreI'm ready f the next one!
I was extremely exced to fd the fourth stallment of the electryg Harry Potter series wag on my dostep  I thought that wh 734 pages this book would last f a while  I looked fward to a good  week's read  I was disappoted though because  only took two days to  fish the book  I just could not put  downThe first chapter recalls  that of the first Harry Potter book  The reader is troduced to  disturbg plot fmation befe focusg on Harry' summer wh the  Dursley's  Harry's scar is hurtg aga as Voldemt refuses to die  In  this novel Voldemt is present throughout as opposed to makg a brief  appearance at the end  This does not bode well f HarryRowlg  addresses the issue of wizards  wches  outside of Engl  Hogwarts  wh the raucous Quiddch Wld Cup  the unheard of befe Tournament  of Champions  This tournament keeps the reader on the edge of their seat  as we wa to see what challenge will be faced nextThe fourth novel  defely has a darker note than the previous three  Voldemt is present  throughout  the Mistry of Magic is shown to be as flawed as any  government  Harry is comg of age  Rowlg no longer treats him as a  precocious boy  He must deal wh the problems of becomg a man but  luckily he has his godfather Sirius to help himI would not dare  spoil the endg f any Harry fans  I will say though that Harry  Potter's fourth year at Hogwarts ends nothg like his first three years  I hope JK Rowlg is wrg her ltle heart out because I already do  not know how I will manage to wa f the fth stallment
JK Rowlg has exceeded my expectations  I was eagerly anticipatg readg me of Harry's adventures on the Quiddch field  scrapes wh danger as he contued his studies as Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry  However I was not disappoted to fd other players on the  Quiddch field  the book of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire My  level of uneasess grew as JKRowlg developed layer upon layer of  suspenseful episodes throughout Harry's fourth year  I was not prepared  f the twist of events that unfurled as Harry met students from other  wizardry schools  events confirmed his suspicions of familiar  acquatances  The tempo of encounters wh peril  you-know-who varied  just enough to keep me off guard  I rema  awe of JK Rowlg's  creative abily to draw readers to the magical wld at HogwartsMany  families have enjoyed previous Harry Potter books to read aloud together   JK Rowlg's art cleverly creates stressful environments  The Goblet of  Fire that may be too tense f some young readers  My family was  thrilled to read a book wh suspense tture mystery  death whout  the prolonged ge  gristly details geared toward the older reader   Parents will be sensive to their own children's emotional development   recognize that this book is f readg aloud after the ltle ones have  gone to bed
I must adm that after I saw the size (734 pps) of the new book I was que concerned that JK Rowlg must have been  need of a good ed  But true to fm she wastes not a wd  description  My only reason to  skip text would be to get to the next part but I couldn't because the  wld she created is so rich  deep I would miss somethgThen as  I started readg the book I thought she must be gettg sloppy  her  surprises  In Book 1 she surprised me  Book 2 she surprised me so   Book 3 I didn't bother to guess  just let her drive the sleigh  In this  book I quickly caught her attempts to trick me  KNEW Image my  surprise  delight when she fooled me aga!Now to wa f year 5  at Hogwarts  f my son to fish  so we can laugh about 
Although Ms Rowlg's comm of the language  wrg style are exceptional  que engrossg the subject material leaves much to be desired The selfish  precocious use of wchcraft  wizardry are very  dangerous deed  real le  makg these appear terestg   excg to youngsters is very irresponsible This material is not suable  f adults let alone young impressionable mds Please do not allow your  children to read this book And please encourage Ms Rowlg to apply her  exceptional wtg talents toward better ends The reason f a low number  of stars is the content The reason f 2 rather than 1 star is the  auth's skillful style

I've been countg down the days till July 8 rereadg the first three books  hopg the fourth would live up to all the anticipation  Well  does - 's the best  the series so far  There's much me depth to  the supptg characters - I especially like the subplots f Ron   Hermione -  the villas are even me menacg  It's me frighteng  than the earlier books but then even &quotScerer's Stone&quot had  some truly chillg moments  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot simply has me  frequent  me extended passages revealg the treachery of Voldemt   his followers  It makes you realize how imptant  is f Harry   his friends to fight the dark powers  master their own power so they  can hopefully fally triumph  Book 7I really like how Rowlg is  begng to tie the book together  the series - characters  themes  from earlier books reappear makg  clear how well-thought-out the  series is  the endg leaves you eagerly awag Book 5 wantg to  see how the plot strs will contue to evolve  The endg is satisfyg   s own right - Rowlg doesn't leave you hangg just lets you know  that just as  real le everythg doesn't get wrapped up all at onceThis may be a children's fantasy novel but 's as well wrten as  thought-provokg  oddly enough as realistic as anythg I've ever  read  (I'm 25  have an English degree  I'm not embarassed to say the  Harry Potter books are among my fave wks certaly  English   this century)  While there's magic aplenty the emotions of the characters  as they face their problems are almost pafully real  Rowlg's  evocations of the trials of early adolescences - first crushes bullies  awkward growth spurts school dances - are remarkably true to le   made me care even me f the characters as they fought their magical  problems as wellThis is a wonderful book f anyone 10  up  might  be too complex  sometimes too frighteng f younger children  Sure  's long sure 's got many terweavg plot strs but I thk that  only makes  better f children  teens  It's refreshg to see a book  that doesn't underestimate the telligence  readg abily of young  people  And any adult who dismisses the series because 's wrten f  children is missg some wonderful wrg any adult who dismisses this  book  particular is missg some of the fest plottg   characterization I've seen as well as a truly excg adventureWell  now I'm gog to go re-read the entire series so far  start countg  down till Book 5  Rowlg is remarkable  I know the next book like  this one will be well wth the waght  be too complex  sometimes too frighteng f younger children  Sure  's long sure 's got many terweavg plot strs but I thk that  only makes  better f children  teens  It's refreshg to see a book  that doesn't underestimate the telligence  readg abily of young  people  And any adult who dismisses the series because 's wrten f  children is missg some wonderful wrg any adult who dismisses this  book  particular is missg some of the fest plottg   characterization I've seen as well as a truly excg adventureWell  now I'm gog to go re-read the entire series so far  start countg  down till Book 5  Rowlg is remarkable  I know the next book like  this one will be well wth the wa
I'm not gog to spoil the sty f those of you who haven't yet read the book but this book is vast  I'm afraid followg on from the previous books  was a b too much f me Havg bought the other three books only a month ago I read them all very quickly  The first two I greatly  enjoyed readg them on sequential days  The third took a b longer  firstly because  seemed less excg -  had too many twists  the  plot but less coherence -  the whole atmosphere was much darker  The  fourth book seems to have moved even further  this ve as Rowlg's  publishers happily admI should emphasise that I am an adult reader   these books are of course aimed at children Furtherme havg read  all four  such sht succession creased the possibily of  &quotsaturation&quot so maybe I am beg a ltle unfair It's just that  despe  maybe because of the first two books' beg such good  adventures I feel that the fmula isn't so well sued to sequels as CS  Lewis's Narnia series  the (admtedly very dferent sht sties of)  Richmal Crompton's Just William series  certaly not to sequels that  are ever larger  me convolutedThat said anyone who can get  millions of children  away from their Ntendos Playstations etc   readg books deserves a round of applause!Sry
In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire JK Rowlg has outdone herself  Harry Potter just wantg to be a nmal 14-year-old wizard once aga must perfm heroic deeds  Some new characters make an appearance while all the old characters return  Buy this book befe s to late  Excellent book  Recomend to all!  I can't wa until books 5 6  7  arrive
I am 30 years old  I must say this book is one of the best books I have read  my le Simply amazg this book is Very dark  deadly  brgs back Harry Potter series to square one You will know what I meant  after you read  JK Rowlg has out done herself  this book wh  unfgetable characters  sister plot Me  me her wrg is  maturg  so are the characters I would say this series is no longer a  children's but a full blown Myster/Suspense/Hr book that one would  expect from Dean Koontz  Stephen Kg Thk twice befe you read this  book to kids under 12 years old Nevertheless very entertag   utterly fulfillg Harry Potter V will sell 10 million HB next year
This book is the best hs down  the series I read this 734-page book  3 days! I'm tellg you you can't put  down! Harry is faced wh a lot of real le suations like havg a crush on Cho Chang another  house seeker This is the best book I've ever read  I hope  is f you  too
I've just started rereadg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  sure enough am amazed at all the rich detail  characterization that I missed on my first readg  The plot  adventures were just as imagative   excg as ever but the characters wh their greater depth  matury  were what f me made this book so magical  Now my family  I are  readg  aloud to sav every msel of this wonderful adventure  And  yes I plan on gog back  rereadg all 4 books soon to look f clues  about what to expect  Book 5
I adm  I am an adult  yet I spent the better part of the last two days stealg time to read [ yes fish ( isn't sht)]this book Harry Potter is not the wld's greatest wizard- JK Rowlg is Only magic can expla her abily to deliver a book as satisfyg as  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  the face the enmous  pressure hype  expectations that built up to  No mere mtal could  have pulled  off  Though HPatGoF starts somewhat slowly wh a  prologue  quickly regas momentum wh a return vis wh the Weasleys  followed by the Quiddch Wld Cup between Irel  Bulgaria Rowlg's  trademark imagative touches are everywhere: team col badges that scream  the players' names flags that play their national anthems when waved   action figures that are really active  After that we're back to the fourth  year at Hogwarts where Harry is chosen as s representative  the  Triwizard Tournament agast rival schools Durmstrang  Beaux-batons  Of  course the threat of Voldemt shrouds the proceedgs leadg up to a  thrillg w duel that will not disappot even the most avid Rob Hood  Star Wars  Three Musketeers fans  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is a wthy success to  the three books that came befe   It entertas  structs   a  wld where real-le heroes are often less than heroic  provides role  models f kids of all ages I eagerly awa book five
After fightg my kid sister f the family copy of Harry Potter 4  doggedly plowg through the 750-somethg pages  just under 24 hours I can say wh some reluctance that I did enjoy  Miraculously JK Rowlg has kept  up The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series is at  least as good as the previous novels  not better While the book does  start out considerably slower than the others  takes 's own sweet time  gettg to any real action my opion overall is that the wld has self  another good read The book  was certaly &quotme dark&quot as promised  I enjoyed the fact that  the auth did become me &quotruthless&quot wh the plot F once  the book does not end on an upbeat note -- a nice change from the  &quotwonder kid fights dark ld wonder kid ws&quot arrangement f  the previous three  a val movement to keep the entire series from  becomg essentially monotonous Overall no masterpiece -- but another  engagg sty wh the usual &quotdidn't see that comg&quot  conclusion Happy Readg!-- Alia
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book! JK Rowlg cludes so much detail  her books The detail made the book feel like I was actually   watchg everythg happen The characters felt so real  It felt like I knew the knew them It was so hard to put this book down  It's a very long book but the book is wthwhile  This book is the  fourth book of a series about a boy named Harry Potter Harry Potter is a  wizard who is startg his fourth year at a wizardg school called  Hogwarts He doesn't know that the school year will be a scary but  adventous one This school year is very dferent than others f Harry  If I could I would give this book six stars
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is by far the best book of the Potter series  As Harry is thrusted to his 4th yr at Hogwarts he is pleasenly suprised when he fds out that a long tradtion stopped years ago will be relived once ag at hogwarts  Harry has to deal wh a few  &quottask&quot requrg w courage  of course magic  Harry has to  combe his four years of education to over come these obsticals along  wh some new found spells  Along wh learng new spells Harry begs  to take trest  girls specily one of whom harry shares a common love  wh  Although he is famous  doesn't mean his crush we'll like him  back    When i fished this book i was  stunned that  was as good as the media said  was  F the few hours   took me to read this book i was happy to leave the muggle wld behd   feel as  i were a wizard too

JK Rowlgs is planng a series of seven Harry Potter books makg &quotHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire&quot the pivotal Book 4  And pivotal  is  In the first three Ld Voldemt is weak  almost  powerless but we know that his &quotfahful servant&quot Wmtail has  headed off to fd him at the end of Book 3  We are also promised that he  will come back wh a vengeance  And that he doesIf Harry thought he  was gog back f a busess-as-usual fourth year at Hogwart's then he's   f a surprise  But surprises are busess as usual at Hogwart's  aren't they?  From the Quiddch Cup Fals to the Third Task of the  Triwizard Tournament Harry  his friends are  f another year of high  flyg  deep divg adventuresAnd nestled among all the brave  rescues  fearless flyg is a ltle b of romance f our fourth year  students  We relive our own awkward moments of fdg a date as Ron   Harry try to fd dance partners f the Yule Ball  And then they fd out  that maybe there has been a beautul girl right under their noses all the  timeBut always underlyg the festive holidays  trips to Hogsmeade  is the question:  Why is Harry  the Triwizard Tournament?  Who entered  his name  to what end?  As usual we are kept guessg to the end   no matter what you thk you will be surprised  Once aga Harry will  come face to face wh his mtal enemy Ld Voldemt but wh three  books left  the series we know there will be me to come  The book  ends wh a greater sense of anticipation than the other three have  There  is no doubt that the Dark Ld is back!If the book has any fault  is  when  uses contrived means to reveal thgs  the past that we need to  know  Harry spends some time  Profess Dumblede's thoughts the sole  purpose of which is to reveal past events  Then later an accomplice of  the Dark Ld is given truth serum  through his narration the pieces  of the puzzle beg to f together  It would have been nice  events  could have led to evable conclusions  just a few questions asked to  brg us up to speed  Unftunately there is just so much gog on   this book  would have been hard to accomplish that task whout usg  the methods employedThe book is over 700 pages long  therefe one  is fced to put  down at some pot but fdg that pot is always  dficult  I always wanted to fd out what happened next  Fans will not  be disappoted wh &quotHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire&quotation the pieces  of the puzzle beg to f together  It would have been nice  events  could have led to evable conclusions  just a few questions asked to  brg us up to speed  Unftunately there is just so much gog on   this book  would have been hard to accomplish that task whout usg  the methods employedThe book is over 700 pages long  therefe one  is fced to put  down at some pot but fdg that pot is always  dficult  I always wanted to fd out what happened next  Fans will not  be disappoted wh &quotHarry Potter  The Goblet of Fire&quot
I just fished this book   was GREAT (do we expect less?) However  was a ltle gy I love the way the auth always makes the person you expect least the bad guy Compared to her other books I would give this  book a 4 not totally up to the usual stards but VERY good The only  faults I fd is that  was a b gy  she should I spent me time on  the wld cup (I love Quiddich :))
I came back from a holiday  found myself gog straight to our local Brish bookshop to see  the books had arrived yet  to my utter delight they told me that I was only the second person to have come to  collect my pre-dered book sce they had arrived the hour befe!I went  straight back home didn't even bother unpackg  started to read It  has been 2 days straight  still I have only stopped to eat  not even  sleep much!  The book is amazg What wh me read to enjoy  the  quietness of my bedroom I am really enjoyg  I love the way JKRowlg  wres  grips you so that you have to contue readg because you thk  that you are gog to miss somethg  you so much as put  down f a  second!  It is so well doneat the Quiddch Wld Cup falthe  description is so real that you can just image the crowds  the  players as though you are somehow part of ! I made a promise to myself  that I would savour every wd that I read as I went on but found that my  eyes were beg pulled from wd to wd so fast that  no time at all I  had fished the chapter I thk that each book that she has wrten has  defaley been a masterpiece whout question  that  has entranced  both adults  children to the amazg sties  excg  wonderful  characters that she has been able to conjure  a wld full of mystery   yet magical excement that will almost certaly be Classics  the near  future
Once aga Rowlg has given her readers an excellent styf wizards  Muggles old  young After weeks of patient wagI gobbled up the entire escapade of Harry  company The challenges f young Potter crease  this sty begng wh the Durstley imposed diet meant to slim down Dudley The pace picks up when the Weasleys ve Harry  Hermione along to the Quiddich cup a maj sptg event  the wizardg wld Befe long Harry  his friends have found themselves  the midst of a maj stir  The trio are terested  solvg this caper but the heavy courseload facg Fourth-year students at Hogwarts academy keeps them extradarily busy  Will they ever learn [the truth]? It won't take readers long to fd out as 's nearly imposible to put down this laugh out loud suspense at least I couldn't Happy readg!
I was prepared to be disappoted how could she possibly top the first three books? But the fourth Harry Potter book is the best one yet- wh credible characters  a rivetg sty I don't want to give the plot  away f anyone thkg of buyg this book- so I'll leave you wh this  advice: get  you won't be disappoted I hope Ms Rowlg has already  started the next one
Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogswarth does not disappot! As this new adventure begs we fd Harry's nemesis is at  aga tryg to rega a foothold  the real wld The prediction of Madame Trelne was  actually crect  Wmtail is defely assistg him  attempt at a  return to power This is one of only hundreds of thgs that happen to  Harry Hermani  Ron  this latest stallment Defely an excellent  read f adults as well as children I could not put  down  had to  fight wh my son over who's turn  was to s  read The entire Harry  Potter series has opened a whole new wld of readg to thouss of  children my own cluded! Although the subject matter is a tad scary   the book is very long over 700 pages  will not deter even the youngest  fan of the series from readg  from cover to cover no matter how long   takes! The only draw back to this book that we will have to wa over a  year to fd out what happens to Harry at his 5th year  Wizardg School!
I loved this book  It went to a new level (a ltle darker)  a total catalyst f the next book which I am depressed I have to wa another year f  Characters are great!  Rowlg just took  up a notch!  Yea!
The Quiddch season may have been cancelled but JK Rowlg still delivered an action-packed thrillg fourth year at Hogwarts  _Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_ She has carefully woven threads from  earlier novels to this book  contued the suspense that grows me   me tricate wh each novel  The Triwizard Tournament was  masterfully crafted  executed  the appearance of the two oldest  Weasley brothers rounded out the family ptra Rowlg has defely  demonstrated that her novels grow me mature wh her characters This one  clearly appeals to an older audience although I am sure the younger Harry  Potter fans are givg  their best spell
Harry Potter faces many new  dangerous thrillg  funnychallenges  &quotthe Goblet of Fire&quot Like the previous threenovels the conclusion of the book left me surprised-  deliciously pleased!
THE GOBLET OF FIRE is wonderful  wth the wa  I loved the fact that Harry  friends are bona fide teenagers now showg terest  datg  gettg a b cheeky wh adults (especially the Dursleys!)  The  book is lovgly crammed wh details of wizard le  might be the  wtiest of the tles to date  As the auth promised 's also a ltle  darker  the endg twist heralds higher stakes  me tense  conflict f Book V
I just fished readg  yesternight  I am 11 years old  I thk 's the best one yet!  Mad-Eye Moody the Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher the Death Eaters Wmtail returns the bogus conversations between Ra Skeeter  Harry Hermione's obsession wh house-elvesThe  Voldemt-detect scar the Triwizard Tournament Harry's conversations  wh Sirius  the madness of Mr Crouch are only a few of the many  many many excg thgs  the 4th Harry Potter!
The fourth stallment  JK Rowlgs Harry Potter Series is everythg I was hopg  would be  From the begng she already had my md guessg who was tryg to capture the young wizard  up until the very  end she kept me on my toes  My only half-hearted complat would have to  be that the book follows the same fmula as the previous three  Other  than that one m thg I found the book to be excg  hard to put  down  I can't wa to see what happens to Harry Potter next
JK Rowlg has come through aga  Each book seems to get better  better  Harry  his friends are charmg  delightful  Rowlg has such a knack f remdg us what  was like to be young  imagive  I welcomed the 700 page book because the other books ended too quickly!  I  recommend this book ( all the other Harry Potter books) to people of all  ages!
One of the reasons I read this book was curiosyI had to fd out whether after all this hype this book was wth  I was full of hopes that I didn't have to liken  to such hyped up disasters such as  &quotGodzilla&quot  even the Tanic I came out of readg this book  havg sufficietly answered my question And I would have to say  &quotyes&quot this book was wth the hype precedg This book at 640  pages is the longest children's book ever prted However this is only  one among multiple recds that Harry along wh his friends at Hogwarts  have broken This book comes  the middle of Harry's education at  Hogwarts  also the middle of Rowlg's proposed series of seven books  depictg Harry's education  le at Hogwarts   the magical wld  (one book f each year of his education at Hogwarts school of wchcraft   wizadry) And this book where Harry is 14 signalls the turng pot  f this seriesThis is the book where Harry discovers hmones ( Ron  discovers that Hermione is a member of the oppose sex) where the death  of a well established character comes to pass This book dfely sts  out from the previous three volumes of Harry Potter The first three books  all followed the pattern where the fist chapter tells us how Harry is  gettg on wh the Dursleys (a muggle family that harry is most  unftunately related to) how he has managed to get by durg the long  two summer months spent wh them And where the last chapter always closes  wh Harry very happy after another year full of triumphs over evil at  school If you were expectg to fd a similar pattern  this book you  may be surprised I will not reveal the plot except to say that  is me  tricate than ever befe  less fairytale-like ( the sense that they  live happily ever after)than the other booksThis truly is a book wth  readg However This book left me feelg rather depleted  a way none  of the other booksdid This is probably because the conclusions that I had  drawn as to who was the &quotbaddie&quot were proved to be very wrong   possibly because I had vested so much of my time to readg   had  become so entwed  the wonderful wld of Harry Potter that I felt at a  loss of what to do next when I found the book to be fished I cannot wa  until the arrival of the next book  a years time  hope that as the  others have got lengthier as they went on (the first book beg 223pages  long the second 251  the third 317)that the next book will exceed 640  pages Hope sprgs eternal!
In the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series JK Rowlg keeps us riveted  clutchg our seats wh action suspense mystery hum friendship  even a ltle romance! This is a must-read f anyone!  Even non fantasy lovers will love this book!  Be warned though you  shouldn't read this book  you haven't read the previous Harry Potter  books  Also parents be warned this book contas elements of death that  might be scary f younger kids  In this book Harry attends the Quiddch  Wld Cup the Triwizard Tournament is revalized (you'll have to read  the book to fd out what that is!)  well I don't want to tell you too  much  will ru the enjoyment of readg the book!  Wether you love  fantasy sties  not Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire will grip you   keep you beggg f me!
Harry's fth year of adventures at Hogwarts was centered around the Triwizard Tournament  While I missed the Quiddch matches that are usually associated wh his explos the events leadg up to the  Triwizard champion's selection  the tournament events were very  entertag  I would not rate this as my fave of the four novels  however  held my attention  was very dfficlut to put down  (evidenced by my havg fished readg  by July 9th the day after  release)  The imagery was still just as vivid as the other books  the  series  The sty le was full of twists  &quotgee I didn't expect  that&quots I did however miss the  class sty les  there were a  number of emergg sties that I would have liked me detail on (like  Hermoe's encounter wh the Daily Prophet repter) but I guess me  detail from a 734 page book is a b much to ask I am now eagerly awag  the release of the year five book (anyone have an idea when that may be?)
As I eagerly awaed the 4th Harry Potter I could only guess what extradary thgs would happen My md was full of ideas about quiddch Harry his friends  the evil &quotYou-Know-Who&quot I  bought the book  immediately began to read   The idea that the book  was over 700 pages long did not bother me a b As wh the 1st 2nd   3rd I could not put the 4th book down f the next day  a half So many  thgs seemed dferent  Harry's hmones were startg kick  which  caught me off guard Hogwarts had many new thgs to show as well Evil  lurked  the air  When I was fally fished I concluded that JK  Rowlg had done  aga She had mesmerized me wh her wds  My thirst  is quenched f Harry Potter   f now at least   
I have read all four of the Harry Potter book f the first time  the last 3 weeks  this has to be my fave  It is me depth  the characters are me grown up  my opion  It was wonderful to see Draco Malfoy get what he deserves  I completely felt f po Ron  The  characters all have new attudes  In my friends wds they are all  &quotnastier  me like me!&quot  It has wonderful surprises nice  focus on new people rather than the old rivalries  answers some  long-lastg questions while leavg many other frustratg ones to be  answered hopefully  the next books  In a wd Wonderful!
I adm when I fished Harry Potter  the Prisoner ofAzkaban I had trouble imagg Rowlg could top the book's twistedventive style  s blend of emotion  excment  I am happy to say I was mistaken  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is everythg the last book was  me  It is long (700 + pages) but I could have read 500 me  The sty is a b darker  me tense but nothg out of the dary f Harry the books are just progressg naturallyThe plot le is even me complex than that of Azkaban ( the hs of a lesser wrer  would be unwieldy) but  ties up just as neatly as Azkaban  leaves just enough threads loose to fce the reader to thought of ventg a time mache to travel foward to the release of the next book  I don't want to give anythg away except to say that old friends return  nothg is what  seems (but you knew that  is Harry's wld!)If the books keep gettg better I will have to send Rowlg a request- lend me some money because I'm up so late readg your books I can't make  to wk ( classes)  PS I am 19 am I was very discouraged to discover I only have one friend at college who shares my love of this series  Methks I have some &quotconvertg&quot to do!
Defely the best Harry Potter book so far There's lovely detail of Harry's le outside of school the book spends over a hundred pages befe he even gets to Hogwts  you really get to see what le would be like  to be a wizard  contempary timesThe Triwizard competion is very  excg wh good challenges  tough problems The characters really  come alive lookg like real teenagers You can just see a real  fourteen-year-old gettg to some of the fights Ron hasAn absolute  treasure Buy 
Harry Potter's newest adventure certaly lives up to the previous three books by Rowlg  All of Harry's familiar troubles cludg Malfoy  Snape as well as some new crisis appear  As Hagrid says to him  &quotIt's always somethg wh you Harry&quot  However there's a  slight dference  this year's sty Harry's growg up  Not only have  he  Ron noticed that Hermione is a girl there are others at Hogwarts  causg all sts of butterflies  Harry's stomach  Instead of the day  to day type of sty that Rowlg used wh the first three books The  Goblet of Fire focuses on one big event that affects Harry throughout the  year  Altogether  remds the reader that sometimes bad thgs happen   the hero doesn't always w but the triumph is  contug on  I  highly recommend this to all Harry Potter readers  can't wa f year  5
My book arrived on the pch sometime on Saturday  Sunday (Thank you Amazon!)  I fished   two 300+ page stgs  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is wonderful! I recommend  to older readers especially!  Harry has matured as he enters his fourth year at Hogwart's School of  Wchcraft  Wizardry  so have the  relationships he has wh  virtually everyone imptant  his le These young characters are  dealg wh many of the crazy emotions that puberty throws at pre-teens   I applaud at how thoughly the auth dives to the jealousies   securies wonder  wisdom herent  these turbulent years  My 12  year old niece  I eagerly dissect each chapter as she reads   I am  especially grateful f the opptunies to discuss the hardships of  adolescence  challenges of beg decent  honest young person (Thank  you Cedric Diggy) as we along wh Harry attend our Fourth year at  Hogwart's
Even  you haven't read books 1-3 Rowlg does a nice job of explag the past whout gog to tedious detail  This one's defely darker than the first 3 so watch the appropriateness f ltle ones  Typical of  Rowlg this book has creative twists  turns that make  a defe  page turner  My husb  I bought two books but only one came on  Saturday so we ended up fightg over the one that did arrive  Enjoy!
A very delightful book  The enchanted wizardy details appear every other page to keep you through the 700 pages  The only problem about the plot however is the obvious unnecessy of the Tournament to sneak Harry Potter  out of the school
Unlike some series the plot  style of Goblet does not repeat earlier books  the series  It has plenty of twists  turns lettg us fd out me about Harry his friends  his enemies  All  all a  delightful addion   my opion the best so far - all 752 pages  should be there
Once aga JK Rowlgs shows not only her excellent imagation but her expert understg of children  adolescence!  I found The Goblet of Fire to be the best  most excg Harry Potter yet! Harry Ron Hermione  the rest of the Hogwarts gang are back to start their fourth  year at Hogwarts sounds like the first three novels?  Not at all! JK  Rowlgs makes this book a maj turng pot  the le of Harry  all  wizards  Voldmt is not gone  he is tryg to rise aga    This  book is an excellent read  escape f all ages but please read her  books  der to truly enjoy the wld she has created Fans should also  look f books by John Bellairs especially The House wh the Clock  s  Walls  The Figure  the Shawdows
In one of the best books  the series Rowlg has defely wrten a classic book It is terestg to note that this book does not follow  the tradion of the other Harry Potter books  that where the other books  did not require the reader to have read the previous books  the series   der to underst the book the Goblet of Fire does Also whereas  the  other books Voldemt is never really described  detail  the Goblet of  Fire his malice can truly be sensed The Goblet of Fire followg  the  tradion of Philip Pullman leaves an amazg clfhanger at the end  makg sure that the reader will read the next book the second  comes  out Although after the ial attention grabber  the begng of the  song the book slows down  picks s momentum back up que quickly  This is truly an amazg book wrten by a masterful auth
Perhaps the greatest surprise  this book is how good  is J K Rowlg manages to not only to recapture the magic of the first three books but then goes on to wre what I believe is the best book yet  I can only hope that the rest of the series holds true to the brilliance displayed so  farGreat wk Ms Rowlg  thanks from all your millions of  readers
The fourth book  the Harry Potter tale is as pivotal to the series as the book jacket says Despe the hype  is as much fun  as touchg shockg  poignant as the first three Many postive messages f kids about dog the right thg keepg friends  friendly competion as well as some serious messages about prejudice jealousy  envy This book feels less like Roald Dahl  CS Lewis  me like STAR WARS -- THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACKBook four starts off at the Quiddch Wld Cup This event is the only time we will see the spt  this text as the year long -school tournament is cancelled  fav of a three wizard-school magic championship open only to older students Of course Harry officially too young to enter has been entered agast his will  fdg out who is behd  is the ma mystery behd this book Rowlg also takes an terest  showg Ron Hermione  Harry growg up as their "teen" personalies assert themselves  their terests change  tempers flare There is a welcome return of several characters from the previous books  much of the mystery histy  polics of the wizardg wld Harry has entered is expled  explaed as well as how the wld was befe the fant Harry stopped Voldemt The outcome of this book sets up the possible direction the fal three books will probably take  hts at a great shakeup among the characters both liked  disliked as well as a future culmatg gr battle between good  evil as the climax of the series I am sure we will probably lose me characters  future books as this one ends both tragically  omously Thgs are only begng Cant wa f book 5
As an adult who has always loved children's lerature I have just caught on to the Harry Potter wld which combes some of the elements of Star Wars the Ld of the Rgs Brish school sties by Enid Blyton the  Narnia Chronicles  the sly verbal wizardry of one of my fave  humists Roald Dahl There are elements of Willy Wonka  the me  serious Albus Dumblede  Fred  Gege the Weasley tws who love  playg pranks Dudley Dursley surely follows  the footsteps of spoiled  brats Veruca Salt  Mike Teevee while Harry shows a few similaries to  Charlie  James of James  the Giant Peach Of all the books  the  Harry Potter series Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is probably my  fave  that  covers a lot of ground  has me emotional range  than the others I wish that I could have read this from a child's  perspective but sce that's not possible I can say that  offers plenty  of fun f those adults who need fantasy just as much as children This is  an ideal book f adults to share wh youngsters cludg spts-mded  kids (who will love readg about the Quiddch Wld Cup)  those who  like blood  guts  nmally have a hard time stg down to read The  pace  sense of adventure never lets up  there is me of a sense of  profundy  darkness throughout the novel Harry's encounters wh Ld  Voldemt  his tests durg the Triwizard contest echo the fact that  Harry is begng to grow up test himself  figure out what he believes   where he fs to the wld Like her previous books JK Rowlg's  new one has numerous references that poke fun at pop culture human vany   bureaucratic polics wh the framewk of the wizard's wld (One  of my fave references is a book entled &quotMen Who Love Dragons Too  Much&quot) Her evocative names  verbal sleight-of-h are a constant  joy There's good hum throughout  Harry is shown as a boy whose  courage goes h--h wh selflessness  lookg out f his friends   schoolmates who  the book take the place of his family Children's  lerature is tremendously imptant  shapg what children believe   the ma characters of Harry Hermione  Ron are shown wh all their  imperfections funny foibles  jealousies which merely serve to  emphasize their underlyg fidely toward  love f each other  throughout the growg pas of early adolescence In sht I would highly  recommend this book ( this series) f anyone who wants to leave realy  f a while  become acquated wh a fantastic magical yet strangely  down-to-earth wld where the fundamental battle of good vs evil is  leavened wh hum  lovewhose  courage goes h--h wh selflessness  lookg out f his friends   schoolmates who  the book take the place of his family Children's  lerature is tremendously imptant  shapg what children believe   the ma characters of Harry Hermione  Ron are shown wh all their  imperfections funny foibles  jealousies which merely serve to  emphasize their underlyg fidely toward  love f each other  throughout the growg pas of early adolescence In sht I would highly  recommend this book ( this series) f anyone who wants to leave realy  f a while  become acquated wh a fantastic magical yet strangely  down-to-earth wld where the fundamental battle of good vs evil is  leavened wh hum  love
The Harry Potter sty sequence is a comg of age f a young boy set  a boardg school milieu agast a fantastic background of wizardry  wchcraftAmazgly J K Rowlg matas the qualy she  set   the first three books throughout the entire 700+ pages of  &quotGoblet&quot  Her characters are expertly drawn consistent very  much alive  Her plot pots function like clockwk:  there are no awkward  deux macha  loose ends  Her themes are noble: love loyalty fairness   the common struggle agast fear  the unknownCan you enjoy this  book whout havg read the first three?  Perhaps not  Rowlg seems  obligated to fill one  on details  she does this well  But I came  to Goblet admirg the characters  I can't say that a new reader would  be able to do thatIn fact this volume might lose some loyal readers  It has dark overtones  The party is over  's no me Mr Nice Wizard  Because of  Rowlg's sistence on stickg to her igal vision I  admire the book even me
Well once aga Jk Rowlgs has done  Harry Potter IV The Goblet of Fire is by far the best yet The 752 page book is well wth readg Harry Potter on yet another adventure to Hogwarts And faces New Challenges the  whole way There is one thg that I will stressYou really must read  books 1 2  3 (Harry Potter) To really underst  appreciate the  book I am 13 yrs of age  I absolutely love  So does my younger  sister (9)  my parents who I dont thk they would like  I gave there  ages out hehThe book is good f all ages  keeps you wantg to read  whout stop  then all over agasame wh the first 3 books except  this book is even better considerg how long  iswell I hope you get  s my new fave book aside from the first 3  I would recommed  this f everyoneThankyou Jk Rowlg f wrtg !
I was one of the few to stumble upon an extra copy lyg  a bookste after the books had h the shelves on the 8th  I bought  ASAP  read  that night  one stg  If you had been payg attention to the  repts that a maj character dies  that Harry begs to like a girl  they are all true but  is not as predomant  the book as I expected  which  my opion made  the same sta tale that Harry Potter has  always told  While the sty was good  there was still some funny  scenes the book seemed a tad generic  I still loved the book  all  Harry Potter fans need to buy this  read   those who haven't read  the Harry Potter books should read them all There was some maj  character developments  scenes that all seemed to be potg to a  wonderful fale of the series  The clfhanger endg makes me wish that  the 5th book was comg out along wh this one  I cannot wa till s  release  I liked !
This enstallment of the Harry Potter series is the most excg one yet  The book focuses me on Harry's connection wh Voldemt  what le was like  the wizardg wld when he was at full power  When we fd  out we realize how dangerous Voldemt really is  Readg this book  leaves you eagerly wag f the next one  The endg leaves open the  room f a fth book that could well be even better than the fourth  JKRowlg has done a wonderful job  wrg a book that defely is a  great follow up to the previous one  One can only look fward to what is   ste f Harry Potter
Rowlg does  aga--suspense illusion trigue  Okay some of 's predictable but maybe not f kids  Be fwarned 's over 700 pages  the clues so obscure I wonder  any kids can untangle the web  It's a  real page-turner as you try to figure out who the bad guy(s) are what  they're up to  how &quotyou-know-who&quot is gog to come back   threaten Harry  this time not to mention how Harry will get out of    who will come to his &quotrescue&quot to help It's full of excement  Quidch a new contest  of course a new profess of Dark Arts  Be  sure to fish the first three befe startg this one  I wish I hadn't  read   one day  How long until book five comes out?
Ok I am a huge Harry Potter fan When I got the first three books I read  them all twice  that month! I had this book pre-dered from Amazon sce  Feb 2 When I got this book on July 8 (the day  came out) I did not put   down f three days! You just can't This is the best Harry Potter yet  If you are even a small Harry Potter fan BUY THIS BOOK! You will not be  disappoted
This is a really great book  I am ne years old  read the entire book  three days  I couldn't put  down  It is excg funny suspensful  scary all at the same time  The other three Harry Potter books are  great but this one is the best because  goes beyond Hogwarts to the  Triwizzard Tournament  The tasks  the tournament are dficult   dangerous  I couldn't see how they turned out  Everyone should read  this book  JK Rowlg should keep on wrg
After readg the lattest of Harry Potter books I sat back wondered how much the wld has really changed  the past yearsfget the net fget the Berl wall fget the news you hear everyday - I'm talkg about somethg me imptant  me fundamental When I was a kid I read every &quotFamous Five&quot book  they all had the same structure: a group of friends could hardly wa f the start of their vacations where the most wonderful thgs happened Now I read the Harry Potter books  I see  all aga reflected  a mirr: a group of friends can hardly wa f their vacations to end  their classes to beg because there's where all the fun  adventure beg Both the &quotFamous Five&quot  the Harry Potter books are great but the pot is that this fundamental dference between them tells us me about the way the society changed than a bunch of sociological studies Thk about 
This book is defetly the best yet  Harry fds himself participatg  Triwizard Tournament(a wizard mi-olympics) whout putg his name  the Goblet of Fire  he is picked fourth even though only three students are  ment to be choosen Harry  his friends are shure his name was put  the  Goblet of Fire to get rid of him but by who  why  There are plenty of  new characters as well as old ones  The endg is very terestg   plot twistg  This book will defatly leave wantg the book 5
This HAS to be the best Harry Potter book yet I just fished  today  I LOVED  It was long yeah but  goes really fast once you start readg  I know that some people are probably gog to say that all the  stuff about Cho  Fleur  the Veela was hrible  should never have  been put  there but give me a BREAK! That's le! I'm not gog to say  much me about the book because a lot of people haven't read  yet   that would ru  f them but  was great no matter what anybody else  says
Rowlg has done  aga!  Goblet of Fire kept me up all night I couldn't put  down  I feel like I have grown up wh Harry  his friends at Hogwarts  The language  decription of the Wld Cup  Quiddch game is superb  It had me on the edge of my seat as  I was   the sts  The plot twists  turns kept me guessg all the way  through  This is defely the best  most essential book of the  series  At each task Harry shows me  me character  courage  He  has become one of the most endearg characters  recent  not all  lerary histy  I can't wa f the next book
This book is an excellent contuation of the series  may be my fave sce Scerer's Stone  There's a tremendous amount of action  Goblet of Fire: characters  suations change the heroes grow up   the hizons of the wizardg wld broaden as  by uh magic  Ms  Rowlg could have produced a fmulaic book   would still have been a  bestseller but this is not just me-of-the-same What me can I say  whout spoilg the sty?  :)It's unftunate that  takes her so  much longer to wre these books than  takes us to read them  I'm  already lookg fward to fdg out what happens next  which of the  new characters will stick aroundAs a personal note I just have to add  that I like Hermione better all the time
After about 2 days of nonstop readg I fally fished what will most deftely be a children's classic  the future  And I can easily say that  is the best book  the entire series  When I first picked up the book  realized how heavy  long  was I was scared that the book would  tend to just  some places but to my surprise the excement only keeps  buildg  makes you feel like you can't put the book down until you've  fished   The ma characters are much me devolped  this book   are startg to grow up especially Ron- we start to see him openly jealous  of Harry's constant spotlight  openly shameful of beg po  And  Harry Ron  Hermione all start to see the oppose sex as me as just  friends (especially Ron  Harry)  The book is darker  me adult then  the previous three  I have a feelg that there will be some  controversy about these books beg too scary f younger kids (which I can  assure there will be scared stf  I love how the book does  not really end  a happy note like the past 3 have  is sad   depressg  I CAN'T WAIT to read what JK Rowlg has  ste f us  next- please keep wrg the comg books just like this one!
This book is amazg It is fast paced  rivetg This though the most volumous is the best Harry Potter Once you start readg you just can't put  down till you are done wh  I loved every moment of this  book Characters like veela description of the wld cup match  the  triwizard tournament  return of evil Voldemt  the meetg of  Potter  Voldemt - everythg is so engrossg about this book  rich   imagation  detail JK Rowlg has once aga done a terric job  !
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire as promised is darker  me sister Its darker tone though does not distract from the hum  good-natured fun that has become a tradmark of these books You can see the  characters growg up as they become me aware of the oppose sex   have a greater understg of le's dficult realies  I'm not sure  how younger children will deal wh the death towards the end of the book  I would suggest readg  together  talkg about the issues that  arise There are also some terestg ideas about prejudice  slavery  that come out when Rowlg describes the house-elves   &quotmudbloods&quotOverall a good read I would recommend  to my  seventh grade students but I'm sure they are all readg  already
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book  the fantastically successful Harry Potter series I've read all four  by far was most impressed wh this one As usual Rowlg gives us some  hilarious sight on the Dursley family as Harry eagerly awas his fourth  year at Hogwarts a school f wizards  wches Harry's fantastic  adventures lead him to the Triwizard Tournament one of the most  rewardg- deadly-challenges  wizardg histy Harry  just a few  others from other wizardg schools must complete three tasks  der to  claim the tle of Triwizard ChampionHarry is also allowed a  once--a-letime chance to attend the Quiddich Wld Cup! The excement  doesn't stop there-Harry has the best seats  the stadium at the Top  BoxHarry's anxiety is not limed to only the tournament however  Harry's lightng-shaped scar has begun to hurt every once  a while a  pa that Harry remembers only when Ld Voldemt was near him Could this  mean that You-Know-Who is fally returng to wreak havoc  revenge on  Muggles  wizards alike? Or is Harry's scar just romly causg him a  ltle pa durg dreams? Strange signs beg to arise such as the rise  of the supposedly vanished Death Eaters  the Dark Markbut you can only  fd out by readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of FireI've read all of  Rowlg's books  none have disappoted This book is no exception   I thoughly enjoyed every page I strongly recommend that you read 
I started readg the Harry Potter books when I was student teachg  a Jr High  The students seemed to devour the books  I was curious to see what the fascation was  After the first book I was hooked!  This  latest stallment is the best yet  The 734 pages seemed to fly by  Old  characters  new combed to make an terestg  compellg sty  From Hermoe  her crusade to save the house-elves to the reappearance  of Voldemt this book was too good to put down This muggle can't wa f  the next book!
This book the fourth  a series of books about Harry Potter lives up to  surpasses the stards set by first three Followg the example of the other books The Goblet of Fire has twists  turns  evey chapter  Each chapter builds up the next until the reader is stunned at the end of  the book wishg f me I hope everyone children  adults read all  of the books  don't leave this one out I know I'll be readg   aga a few me times!
The long-awaed fourth Harry Potter book left me wishg f the fth  There is never a dull moment  although you have your suspicions to the culprs every event throws you off to a new idea  I must confess I stayed up until 1:00 am to fish the second night I owned the thg  because I couldn't face tryg to go to sleep whout knowg the outcome  This is a wonderful book f ALL ages as my mother's sixth grade class  loves  as do my grparents
I fished devourg the fourth Harry Potter book ne hours ( a few gasps of fresh air) after  arrived on my dostep from a Ryder truck  (Apparently FedEx had so many ders to deliver from Amazon on July 8 that   had to rent movg trucks to deliver them all!)The Goblet of Fire  begs wh a (heart-thumpg) teaser chapter revealg both a murder   Voldemt himself  F the next several hundred pages however Rowlg  settles back to the me familiar rhythms of le at Hogwarts (albe  wh a new  excg Triwizard Tournament volvg feign schools)  The outcomes of each competion  the Tournament are unftunately not  too hard to fathom (gee I wonder who's the best wizard of them all?) but  the suspenseful  explosive conclusion of the Tournament makes up f any  shtcomgs  The fourth book remds me a lot of Azkaban  s structure  -- a mostly &quotmundane&quot --  that's posssible f a book about  wizards -- (but very terestg) style f the bulk of the book   an AMAZING conclusion that knocks your electryg Dobby-knted socks  off!Even though the book was thicker than my copy of War   Peace(! )  kept my eyeballs riveted  attention devoted to almost  every wd  The fourth book is studded wh richly-described characters  (from Ludo Bagman to Mad-Eye Moody)  hilarious subplot strs (such as  Hermione's House-Elf Liberation Front)  The book also contas  surprisgly malistic (but very convcg  at times touchg) lessons  -- about the evils of bigotry the dangers of bad parentg the imptance  of loyalty  playg fair  From ethics  love to dental improvements   murder this fourth book has  allAlthough I thk The Goblet of  Fire is an ABSOLUTELY MUST-READ (ha as  anyone needed my review to know  that) my very most fave is still Azkaban (Goblet's not too far behd  though!)Now when's that fth book comg out?
The 4th Harry Potter book is  my opion the best one so far  The plot is countless times me engrossg  unpredictable than the other 3 books put together  The plot strs between the books are seamless   the Quiddch Wld Cup was absolutely amazg  excg  Not to  mention what happened after the game  The description is as good as ever   keeps you wag f the next feast just f the description of the  food Harry Ron  Hermione are all growg up  becomg me  complicated characters  Me light is shed on the dark days of Voldemt's  reign of terr but not enough to stop you from guessg  wonderg  what will be revealed  the next book  One of the maj pots I am  eagerly awag some explag on  the 5th book is why Dumblede  trusts Snape so much  The first few chapters of the book are a b slow  but after the book gets gog hold on to your seat!  This is one of those  books I wish I could read f the first time me than once  Does anyone  know any good Memy Charms perhaps?
Hi!  I loved this book  the way we are drawen  to the magical wld of wizards  is the best book of the year!  2 thumbs up!  The best book  Australia was the third book even adults love this book a great read f  every  any body!  Because even my bld friend can read !  A magical  wld f every body to enter  enjoy the sad times happy times  the  funny times!
Wow I can't believe I'm the first one to get this I'm sure there is gog to be a flood of reviews soon though I just fished Goblet   totally amazg  is so much better than the first three (which are  excellent)  It is dark funny  touchg  The endg actually brought  a tear to my eye  EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!
I thought Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great book because I found  wasn't as far-fetched  spooky as the 2nd Harry Potter book The Chamber of Secrets -- although there is some danger    I liked the  fact that certa characters cludg James  Lilly Potter   Wmtail returned  the fourth book  It is a  suspensful book  has  very humous parts too  Even though Harry has a secret crush  doesn't  get all mushy  It is my fave of the four Harry Potter books
Last night I fished readg my copy of the fourth stallment of Harry Potter  It arrived from FedEx saturday afternoonall 734 pages of   That's right I fished  last night Monday night  This book was so  engrossg that I lerally couldn't put  down  I was wried about this  book  I thought that wh all of the recent hype surroundg the series  that JK Rowlg would stray from the fmula that made Harry Potter a  household name  To my great pleasure this fourth stallment is just as  cleverly wrten as the first three  The characters are maturg befe  our eyes  the adventures are just as excg  nerve-rackg as ever  Pleaseread this book  sav  as much as I did  I am now  anxiously awag the fth stallment )
JK Rowlg's new book  the Harry Potter series is a superbaddion to s already good tles I enjoyed every page of  found the like Harry the contents of the book is maturg She has captured the image of a typical 14 year old  how they view the wld She has a few darker themes that might surprise some but the book would be complete whout them F parents  will provide some opptunies to teach the child about death bigotry comg of age  many me  Harry's fourth year is his strangest yetNew characters add depth  mystery The endg surprises you once aga Enjoy !
I started this book wonderg how  would compare wh the the other 3 which I had loved  I wondered HOW JK Rowlg could improve upon Harry Potter 1 2  3  I read the first 10 pages  so  was a ltle  disopoted  But I kept readg  Suddenly  was a wonderful sty  It  twisted  turned  I was surprised up to the last page  I thk this  book easily compares to other 3  fact 's my fave so far    JK Rowlg contues this pattern I'll like the 5th better then the 4th  the 6th better then the 5th  the 7th better then them all
Rowlg does  aga  It's amazg that each book  the series keeps gettg better In &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot we are swallowed back to the wld of Harry Potter until we surface aga at the end of the  book This is one that you can't put down till the end  Rowlg keeps up  her trademark of surprisg endgs  hilarious quirks seen throughout  the sty (like the tles of the books Harry  Hermione check out from  the library)  Another great job!
I was really concerned that this book was gog to disappot the hype was credible!  Also 700+ pages is a lot of paper to keep a reader's terestI'm glad to say that Rowlg managed to pull  off  I  wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who's enjoyed the series so  far  If you're just gettg volved read the pri three books first  otherwise the lkages  neat bs won't have as much impactGo fd a  free weekend  read 
There have been many beautuly wrten books f kids through the years now there is another to add to the list Here another page turng novel about a young wizard  his magniciant wld Muggles are sure to never  put down this magical book
This book is simply fantastic! I could not put  down from 's unique start to 's suprisg end! Defetly the best so far!
I'm a 38 year-old reader  I had to get THE BOOK (1245 am Saturday on my reciept) right away Read  through- I won't give away the details- yet  lived up to the hype! All parents  adults who read this  haven't  yet got to the series themselves start wh book 1  read them   der you can't go wrong wh Harry!
I've only just picked up on the Harry Potter series  I'm not the typical reader - 23 year old guy but I have to say that the Harry Potter series is the most terestg group of novels I've ever read even  I'm  not exactly 's target audience  Book 4 hardly seems f kids to me   I am sure that  there's been any uproar about whether some of the content  is appropriate f kids befe this book  will only become an  creasgly heated debate as this book takes far darker turns than any of  the other previous books  But this is part of what makes the book special  There is some pretty dark imagery  descriptions of conflict that makes  me question whether  not the book is appropriate f children but then I  remember back to when I was younger readg some of the violence of CS  Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia  I know that  is safe  When novelists  aren't afraid to wre freely then better books are wrten  I believe  this because I believe that the Harry Potter series successfully uses  conflict the threat of conflict  actual violence to create the  suspense of the seriesHarry Potter 4 is the equivalent of 'The Empire  Strikes Back'  It is the best book yet   leaves me sad that I have  raced through  leavg me to wa possibly a year  me f the next  stallment  the series  If any of you parents have reservations please  don't!  Kids are smart  this series will challenge them  ways that  others don't  Hoay f Harry!
It's really magic aga Joanne K Rowlg did ! I was glued to the pages  read the night through I couldn't help laughg out loud sometimes feelg wonderful f aga meetg characters so unbelievably  funny  this book The wrg is darg this book is somewhat grown up  compared to the the predecesss like a creature of Hagrid's Wonderful   funny yet dangerous  dark It's very dark deed  several aspects  though not cruel (as many  me along them feared) The Universe that  Joanne K Rowlg created has reached a size that equals   my opion  to JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth It has the qualy of a spell entrancg  the reader  beg convcg  every aspect While there are people   this book who are victimized by dark fces there is always hope! Hope of  the dividual power of decision  of the help of true friends And the  fun of another year at Hogwarts somewhat dubious  places but nothg a  good wizard  wch couldn't hle! This is a great book!
Just like all of the otherHarry Potter books JK Rowlgdoes  aga!  She wres exceptionalwell-wrten fantasy yet aga  You must buy this  Even  you don't like fantasy  adventure you will still love this book!  Adults don't be fooled this book is f you too!  It has the kid-like tone yet wrten adult-like  Everyone you must buy this book  If you haven't gotten the first three you should defetely buy them also This book is easily just as good as the other three but by far longer (which is better!)  This is defetely wth the dollars  you will enjoy readg  over  over aga as I know I will!
When I first got this book the first thg i noticed was that their were a ton of pages i thought that there was no way i could read this all  still be terested  what happened next i was wrong this book is awesome  the best Harry Potter Book out there Get  IT!
&quotGoblet of Fire&quot lives up to all the hype of the media  expectations readers have after readg the first three books It is still very well wrten  very excg This episode of the Harry Potter saga  is much longer than the previous tales (743 pages) so we get experience a  much me detailed idea of what  is like to live as a wizard  a wch  Harry even spends the first several chapters at the Quiddch Wld Cup  wh the Weasleys so not all of the book ( the plot) revolves around  le at Hogwarts The characters are growg up  as such are gettg  much me mature While the development of the characters leads us to the  typical realm of adolescence (ie: boys &amp girls dances etc)  also  marks a pot where we realise our fictional friends are stronger so  expect a me powerful battle between the fces of good  the fces of  evil Expect &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot to be much darker then your  previous journeys to Harry's wld Don't expect to fd only magic  flaved jellybeans  practical jokes also expect fear mutilation   death &quotGoblet of Fire&quot has a much me realistic  heart felt  endg than what you will be expectg just keep  md that this is all  pival to the overall plot of the seven book series In case I have you  completely down about the dark side of the new book I might as well  mention that we do get to see Sirius  the loveable ltle Dobby as well  as some of Dobby's new elf friends
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  is one of the best books I have ever read In this sty Harry fds out me about his past He also fds out about Voldemt the dreaded wizard I fished this book the day I got  I have read the three other Harry Potter books not just once but eleven  times but this book out does them all I love readg  was delighted  that we bought Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire on the day  was  released My younger sister was very upset that I got to read the book  befe her She is still mad about this cident! My mother is also  le  to read the book I thoughly enjoyed readg this Harry Potter   can't wa f J K Rowlg to fish wrg the next three books  the  series Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is a must read  was wth  the wa!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is an terestg book  It is not as excg as the first three  the series however as &quotGoblet&quot focuses much of s attention on social issues rather then the misadventures of magic  Still the book seems to pick up towards  the end where dark events arise It held my attention  I fished  by  Sunday afternoon  It was a good book~Craig Reed
This is my fave hp book so far  I've read  twice sce I got  on saturday  is really good There are several imptant developments f books to come  the person to die is the one you would least suspect(but  i won't spoil ) This is a great book but you have to read the first  three  you will be very confused
I'm over 50 years old  enjoyed this fourth book because Harry seems to be maturg  facg even me dficult decisions wh good sense  The book got off to a rather slow start  I began to wonder  Rowlgs was  losg her touch    would pick up  Wow  sure did  Once Harry  got back to Hogwarts the convoluted plot unfurled  by the end I could  not stop readg  How long do we have to wa until book five?  I want to  know what happens next!  Contug characters develop new characters are  troduced   this &quotmiddle&quot book of the proposed seven we  sense the overall style is comg together  As usual there are  surprises  This is another fun read f Harry lovers but 's gettg  me serious
Trepidation unjustied This stallment of the series is a spendid contuation of Harry's saga  my only regret as I fished  was that there will be another year-long wa f the next oneI couldn't help  wonderg  Joanne Rowlg hadn't cast a giant Imperius spell on her  readers sce  felt like only mutes had elapsed sce I picked up the  book Sunday mng  yet  was dark outside Sunday eveng as I turned  the last pageBravura plot &amp characterization perfmance as always  !
Ms Rowlg has created yet another wonderful wdow to the wld of Harry Potter  the wizards  wches of Engl  I spent the week pri to July 8 wag wh bated breath f the new book to arrive  when  did I devoured   one stg  I had feared that the  anticipation would have built unreasonable expectations f the book but   anythg  exceeded expectationsAga the characterizations were  excellent  we learn me about the central characters (Harry Ron Fred   Gege especially) but the development of the side characters (Neville   Snape) gave us new sight to the back sty that has been buildg  sce Scerer's Stone  As was expected Harry is growg up  discovers  girls  The book self takes a somewhat me "grown up" tone when compared  to the previous books  The first chapter sets the mood f a darker  possibly me dangerous me "grown up" Harry Potter but this should not  dissuade parents from lettg their child read the books I would encourage  parents to read the books  discuss them wh their children  The parts  younger children may fd frighteng such as death  possibily of  death are thgs that are part of leOverall the book rates as a  good addion to a great series  A must have f Harry Potter fans  a  reason f those few who haven't picked up the series to start book one
The Goblet of Fire is a b overlong  I was disappoted by s almost complete lack of quiddch but  is as well wrten  contaed enough suprises to keep readers on their toes  I enjoyed the endg very much  This is a must read f anyone who enjoyed the other three Harry Potter  books  JK Rowlg has done  aga
As an eighteen year-old I'm a ltle older than Harry Potter's igal target audience Yet I like millions of others was caught up  the vivid wld which JK Rowlg creates The first three books of the series are  all good light-hearted fun enchantg to all ages This book takes a new  turn displayg the versatily wh which JK Rowlg wres From the  first pages you can tell that Harry is older brgg all the evolution  of character  wld-view that comes wh  When we are younger we  bld ourselves to some of the ugless  the wld Yet that very  ugless adds depth to  highlights the beauty  goodness  le In  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire we see the evidence of this  the  characters  the style It is darker yes but  the sense that   is me realistic  ptrayg He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named as the true  carnation of evil he is It adds new depths  ranges to an already  thrillg sty whout overwhelmg the herent hum  light This  book is the most complex yet leavg us wh a lot to muse over durg the  long wa f book five
First off I loved the book I roared through  f most of Saturday This is not a young child's book The darkness that people noticed  &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot is even me pronounced  &quotGoblet of  Fire&quot In tone this series remds me a lot of Susan Cooper's  &quotDark is Risg&quot books but  wh a good deal of leveng hum I  was actually surprised at how well &quotGoblet of Fire&quot hung together  sce  logically divides to two maj  parts - the Wld Quiddch Cup   the fourth year at Hogwarts I am also amazed  impressed at how  consistent the ma characters (Harry Ron  Hermione) rema while  contug to grow to adulthood (wizardhood?) There are some great  new  characters too(I really liked Krum  Moody) as well as all the old  faves In fact one of the few complats I have is jugglg all of the  new characters' sties  made the middle of the book a ltle dfuse I  could have done whout the Bagman subplot although I expect  sets up  somethg f later On the other h Neville's parents' sty really  floed me Po kid And Harry's deal at the end of the book is  credibly tense Which brgs me to my fal complat DO YOU MEAN I  HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE YEAR  TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
I started this book on 12 pm  at 4 pm I begged myself to put  down  der to make  last  But my plea fell on deaf ears by 11:30 pm that night I was done That should be your first clue on how good the book  isThis book most certaly lives up to the hype  mystery that  surrounded  release J K  Rowlg opens a very clear do to Harry's  wldI have never read a book that grabs from the first wd   refuses to let you go until the last  Every time I turned a page my wld  seemed less real while Harry's seemed meAlthough this is a 735  page book  was like &quotDances wh Wolves&quot the frist time you  saw  When you turn the last page  read the last wd you'll  atomactically keep readg  when confronted wh a blank page  will  take a while to dawn on you that  is blank because the book is doneI  have read many books that where tended f children but has subtle adult  overtones like the  Golden Compass by Pullman  But J K Rowlgs  creation is f the child the child trapped  the adult  the adult  This book has made me than one transion not only  is pivol to the  sty le  But  has created a new stard  child fiction that  wrers will fd hard to copy This is an excellent book   excellent  series   schools were smart  would be made required readg f  childrenI know that everyone who reads this book will agree wh me   sayg that 1 the next book should be 1000 pages 2 It should be  released very soon 3 That the hype  media dem f that book will  break recds that makes this one set by book 4 seem pul
The 4th Harry Potter had a lot of hype to live up to   really did a pretty good job  I thk that the begng was a ltle slow- too many chapters befe Harry got to Hogwarts  Once Harry was back  school the  book picked up a b  got back the flav of the previous books  I  noticed that the 4th book was a ltle me iented toward older readers-  me &quotdamns&quot  constant references to boy- girl flirtations  I  dont know  this is just becuase Harry is gettg older  because JK  Rowlg is lettg her books be fluenced by popular culture  This  stallment was very much an &quot&quot book meang that  you  did'nt read the first 3 you would be kd of lost readg this one  Certa thgs  the book were very cute like when Hermione was  pronouncg her name to Vikt the Bulgarian quidch player obviously  this is a question that the auth is constantly asked (especially by us  Americans)  she wanted to clear  up  a cute kd of way  I thought  some of the hts that the auth gave about what was gog to happen   some of the &quotleaks&quot were kd of misleadg  A character did die  but not one of the central characters that we really care about  The  endg of the book was great though  really showed Harry's courage    showed the power Dumbelde has  The endg really set up the last 3  books nicely  I'm sure they'll be very excg to read now that the  wizardg wld is no longer a safe place to be
The long awaed sequel to Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban is here at last  This book tled Harry Potter  the Gobblet of Fire is as  even me climatic  fun filled as the other three Potter books  JK  Rowlg has truely out done herself  this particular book  It displays  many twists  turns as the other Harry Potter books  not many me   There are new surprises as well as new characters addg to the previous  ones  I give this book four stars  two thumbs up  This is a book I  will share  truely recomend to children  adults of all ages  I  myself wish that JK Rowlg contue to wre about Harry Potter  his  le as first a student of Hogwarts then his future job  contug  wh the rest of his le  This is a very extradary book  I hope  all of you will enjoy  as much as I did
I enjoyed the book very much Harry fally notices girls  goes to the quidch wld cup i wont give anythg else away though read  f yourself
I bought the book yesterday mng  fished  last night  Loved   Don't let the length of the book (over 700 pgs) scare you  The only problem now is wag f Book 5
I loved this book (as I've loved the series)  read  far later  the night than I should  I found this the best  the series  As a 30 year old I found the themes complex  terestg  At ten years old though  I thk this novel would have given me nightmares  I thk that anyone who  reads this book to a child should be commended but should be prepared to  spend the extra time after a session to make sure that the child is okay  wh the gog-onsStill I very much look fward to readg this  novel  the whole series to my (eventual) kids
This book was absolutely amazg J K Rowlgs has done  aga This is a must f any library But start at the begng  read them all the way through  buy all four  This one will not disappot you!
The latest Harry Potter book was a wonderful book After gettg  the first day I couldn't put  down! I read  wh the next day! Even though this book seems really long when lookg at  when readg the  book the many pages fly by because you get so caught up wh the characters   sty plot The style like the others  the series is well  woven keepg the reader thkg how thgs happened  tryg to thk  what will happen to the characters next This book is great f all ages  beg well-wrten wh well developed charactersIt is also full of  adventure  excement The recommended ages is 6-12 but I'm sure  everyone will enjoy this book A Must Read!
I thk this is the best so far  the Harry Potter SeriesAlthough the action starts a ltle slow  the begng once the 'ball gets rollg'  is defely dficult to stop   The action  several of  the chapters can make you feel as though you can't turn the pages fast  enoughThe death of well you'll fd out is hled wh the delicacy   seriousness  deserves  the characters responses are que  appropriateThere are a great many lessons to be learned from the  fourth year at Hogwarts  I am anxiously awag Harry's transfmation  to the fth year student--  he who must not be namedAll  all   was defely a fast read  the plot can susta the pages-- a coup f  any medium let alone children's fiction
This Book is amazgly wrten  realy humourous  Firstly we learn that Dudley (Harry's Muggle cous) goes on a diet!  Then Harry goes to watch the Quidch Wld cup the Weaslys come  pick Harry up via Floo powder (they distroy the Fireplace then Fred drops a tofee wh suprisg results  (You should have stuck to your diet Dudley! ) It is suprizg that  two Hogwarts Champions can enter the Triwizard Cup (Harry Potter  Cedric  Diggy)Sirious Black cares f Harry so much that he would go wh 500  feet of a Dements Kiss!  To fd out  Sirious caught the Kiss Buy the  book I would recomend this book to every body that has read Harry Potter  1-3 This craze is probably gog to overtake POKEMON!
This stallment of the excellent series has me f adultsthan f the pre-teen audience that the series purpts to targetWhout givg away much of the plot the themes of media abuse (some of the funniest scenes  the book) race relations  class consciousness have matured the series along wh the audience  I enjoyed the book as I have the others  I am sure that I will not be satisfied when Harry graduates Hogwarts  I want to see him get married have a carreer etc  The me serious themes also make me want to read me from Rowlg beyond Harry Potter  Even wh all of the hype another great addion to the series
When I read Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban I did not thk that books could be any better Now I thk dferently Wh the new possibilys  creases the creativy of the plot  the subtle hum is better then ever I got the book on the mng of  the 8th by FEDEX delivery from Amazon I did not do anythg but read from  1100 am until midnight My mother thought I was sick as I did not eat   did not take any phone calls f the whole day This is the book that you  try to shrug off but try as you might  will not fall out of your h  Now when is the 5th book comg?
The newest Harry Potter book which is defely the most hyped is a very imptant book  terms of plot F example the green light from  Harry's dreams is identied as a spell  Snape's past is fally  revealed But is an explag book an exg book? In this case yes The  big showdown at the end is the best one yet  even  the middle there  is almost as much action as the ends of previous Harry Potters Is the  hyped-up fourth book wth takg your sister's Pikachu alarm clock  101  Dalmatians sleepg bag to the bookste  wag a hundred years f the  FedEx truck? Consider these warngs first If you have not read the third  book (&quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot) &quotGoblet of Fire&quot rus  &quotPrisoner's&quot surprise And you shouldn't spend all night on   like I did Aside from that go ahead! But  may not be wth all the  newspaper articles  yellow bookste signs  got
When I picked up the first book I couldn't put  down! When I read the 2nd book  thrilled me so much I wanted to read the 3rd book! Now JK Rowlg has done  aga wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of FireIn  this book Harry Hermione  Ron go off f another year at Hogwarts  The school is havg a competion of wizards  to enter you had to put  your name  a goblet of fire  Harry got  by someone 4 champions were  chosen  go on excg adventures I will not spoil the book f you but  you will be exced when Harry meets the powerful Ld Voldermt f  the  5th time
Children of all ages waed to the early mn to see what happens to a young boy woth a lightng scar  an abily to get to trouble whout tryg As you start to read to fourth stallment of the Potter sagayou  have to wonder   will compare to the last three I am glad to say that  this wonderful book has outdone the last three Wh s dferent feel   darker plot you can tell that the character  the auth have grown up a  b sce we last heard from them The book made me laughcry  outright  frighten f the brave young man named Harry i would recommend this book  f the young  the young at heart
Rowlg pulls  off aga:  Goblet of Fire is just as good  not better than the first three books All the characters are back  none  are neglected she never misses a detail  she manages Harry's  transion to adolescence whout a wrong note  He's still Harry but  now he has girl problems along wh death threats from Voldemt le wh  the awful Dursleys  a godfather who's a wanted murderer  a dog  I  reached the end stunned by Rowlg's control of the plot  Now I'm  rereadg  f sheer pleasure
The latest  Harry Potter's magical adventures has defely lived up to ( surpassed) s expectations  Like s three predecesss 's a book  that you just can't put down  Although  is the longest Potter book yet  at 752 pages each page is packed wh terestg  imagative  dialogue characters  suations  In Harry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire Harry  his fellow fourth-years become me terested  romances  that sometimes cause conflict  Harry's still wary of You-Know-Who tryg  to be on guard at all times  These wries are compounded when his scar  begs to throb aga  someone makes the "Dark Mark" wh Harry's  w-the sign of Voldemt!  But once Harry gets back to Hogwarts there's  too many other thgs f Harry to concentrate on-the usual class load  Profess Snape's constant watch  of course his crush on a certa  female Quiddch playerThen there's the huge wizardg event that will  take place at Hogwarts f the first time  years!  Harry tries to stay  out of the limelight but is soon unwillgly  mysteriously thrown to  the spotlight- to perilous danger  And then of course are the  hilarious antics of the Weasley tws the adventures of Harry  his two  best friends Ron  Hermione Neville Longbottom's klutzy catastrophes  the tauntg from Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy  the other reasons why  JK Rowlg's books are so successful  However unlike the previous  books some parts of Goblet of Fire concentrate on some scary aspects of  the Dark Arts somethg that parents of small children should take   consideration  And as the auth revealed befe the release of the book  someone does die  Nevertheless the new characters that appear  Book 4  are just as crazy  unique as all of the others  Some of the new  characters come to play as Harry's view of the wizardg wld exps   he  his friends meet wizards from other countries  Like the other  Harry Potters Goblet of Fire is a must-read!Harry Potters Goblet of Fire is a must-read!
Harry  his mates are growg up  this adds much to the complexy of the new book  Not only are there myriad twists  turns  the plot of Goblet of Fire but also the 14 year old hmone bank kicks   boy/girl  relations turn from pure friendship to romanceAll of the old characters  return plus several new ones are troduced such as Mad Eye Moody  The  book is long 730+ pages  the plot  characters are well defed   embellished  the list of magical creatures  spellbdg action  grows onThis is the richest of the books so far as Harry is tested  almost beyond his capacy  The dark scenes are treated wh care   compassion  Feelgs play a large role  this tale of wng losg   playg the gameCan't wa f the next episode!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best of the series yet  JK Rowlg wres as well-- better-- as  the others well enough to make you feel connected to the book  I found myself feelg as Harry must  feel-- happy nervous etc  The series contues 's addictiveness   this fourth book  Don't be discouraged by the length  is well wth the  time  takes to read!
AhI enjoyed this book immensely as anyone could  should! The fourth book  JK Rowlg's Harry Potter series brgs to us the sty of the Triwizard Tournament which by circumstances unknown to Harry becomes  the Quadwizard Tournament hosted by none other than Hogwarts has  danger  ste f all s contestants Followg the fourth year of  Harry Ron Hermione  the awful Draco Malfoy this book is funny  suspenseful  full of delight even  the endg isn't what you expect  (  won't bebelieve me!) Now to end all the 'criqug cheesess'  as my father puts  The Goblet of Fire is a wonderful book but as Harry  grows up so does the contentHarry's love f Cho Chang  the death  of a character (I won't disclose that now!) just goes to show that Fourth  year at Hogwarts is practically a comg of age I recommend this book to  anyone who enjoys a good time  you'll love  right down to page  734! (C'mon now I read   three days! You all can fish  I  assure you You'll hate fishg  though) So have your fun wh The  Goblet of Fire  brace yourself f Rowlg's best one yet!
This fourth book is me mature  a lot darker than the previous books Harry is fourteen now  the tone of the book is older too Rowlg contues to build Harry's wld wh me detail  deeper characters This piece of the sty is  grippg wh better dramatic pacg  a  sense of real peril f a change
I loved this book I could not put  down startg  yesterday afternoon  stayg up late to the night to fish  That said The Goblet of Fire is NOT the same light-hearted playful  relatively sht  sty of the first three  the series From s openg scene which is  not of Harry at the Dursley's house  departs from the themes of the  earlier books of a childhood escape-fantasy While  veers back to the  familiar: Harry wh the Dursleys the Weasleys  wh his friends Ron   Hermione Harry Potter #4 is the first truly dark book of the seriesThe skeleton plot that directed the first three books is rewked here   a longer fmat A full understg of the plot  the various  characters' volvements depends on previous knowledge from the first three  books as well as pastakg attention paid to this fourth stallment  (several jokes  side comments also depend on havg read book 3  specically) Many me characters are troduced as well as several me  profound issues such as an anti-slavery movement  European  ternational relations Like the plot these isssues are not resolved but  left as part of the essentially clf-hanger endgThe most comftg  part of this book was the return of Sirius Black who was my fave  character from the third book I can't wa to read me of the series to  see how JK Rowlg deals wh the new challenges that she has troduced  In the future stallments of the series I hope that Rowlg contues   exps the growg theme  plot while reducg the length  pletha  of characters a ltle b  the quest f a me manageable sty
While I was exced wh the arrival of release IV I was alarmed at the depth  seriousness of the fourth book as the hours slipped by  I am impressed wh JK Rowlg's new release  I dare say that  is her best  of the four but the amount of bderle vulgar language especially the  one spoken by Ron  the amount of deaths that happened  were spoken of   the book might make the young reader afraid  I myself felt a st of  hauntg  the air as I read  was almost reduced to tears near the end  Don't get me wrong this books plays wh your emotions  is still one  of the best reads ever but parents beware this time (unlike the  Goosebumps series) you really are  f a scare!
The fourth Harry Potter book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire has fally arrived  As she proved wh the first three books JK Rowlg can wre one heck of a sty  What's even me amazg is that she keeps  the action gog f over seven hundred pages  I've been impressed by  these books f a number of reasons  The stytellg is excellent  The  books though tended f youngsters are universal  do not talk down  to the reader whatever age  The characters are appealg  And Rowlg  has managed to wean kids off the soundbe size books like the Goosebumps   Babystg Club seriesRowlg has said that she planned the fourth  book to be pivotal  so  is  There is an action-packed Quiddich Wld  Cup (Irel vs Bulgaria)  a wizardg contest  A muckrakg  journalist wh an acid-green pen keeps turng up  Dobby the loopy  house-elf makes a few appearances  Me of Hagrid's background is  uncovered  Dumblede has hired a new Defence Agast Dark Arts teacher  who really knows his stuff  We learn about the Department of International  Magical Cooperation at the Mistry of Magic  meet students from other  wizardg schools Beauxbatons  Durmstrang  Harry  Ron have to fd  dates f the ball  And the stakes have gone up  this book evil has  returned to the wizardg wld  Harry must face me dire   mysterious suations than ever befe  And yes there is a death  hled skillfullyWh any luck the size of this book will give  Rowlg time f a well-earned vacation as she wks on number five  However a movie is  the wks which is a shame sce every reader can  already see Harry  movies are complete while books conta the whole  sty  Me unftunate though is the fact that the merchisg will  come the toys  the happy meals the endless advertisements f junk  The comg marketg has been likened to noise which will overwhelm the  reader quietly enjoyg the books themselves  But here's the rest of the  sty:  the movie will pass on to the video rental places  be tucked  to the &quotfamily viewg&quot area  the merchise will all end  up  the lfill when the next thg comes along but to readers the  books will be  our heads  on our bookshelves  will be shared wh  children yet to comeenjoyg the books themselves  But here's the rest of the  sty:  the movie will pass on to the video rental places  be tucked  to the &quotfamily viewg&quot area  the merchise will all end  up  the lfill when the next thg comes along but to readers the  books will be  our heads  on our bookshelves  will be shared wh  children yet to come
I waed  waed  waed f this book to come out expectg  to be as engrossg as the last 3  I was sadly dissappoted  I could guess what was gog to happen next throughout most of the book  the rest was  fairly unterestg  The feelg of Book 4 was defately me grty  focusg on polics lies  conflict between all the characters  I just  couldn't get to like the other books  This book was about a wld that  just didn't pull me  like the other three books  I hope the next books  will brg back the nocence  wonder of Hogwarts which is what drew   so many readers
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful addion to the series  Wh each book the characters become richer the plots me tricate  the conflict deepens  You get the sense that Harry  his friends are  deed growg older each year as the challenges they face become me  complex  I love the sheer ventiveness of the auth  the way she  creates a wonderfully detailed complex wld filled wh imagative  creations   I can't wa till the next book  the series!
It seems to me this book could have used less secrecy  meedg  The book is a hard read f an adult I can't image what will be like f the youth that  is supposed to be wrten f The heavy use of English phrases makes some parts of the books unreadable f the average AmericanThis is also the first time that Rowlg has made an efft to date what could have been a timeless classic wh references to playstations  suchFally as a parent I was dissappoted f her effts to make a &quotcool&quot character wh long hair  an earg  I didn't md the fancul wches  wizards but this isn't the role model I want f my kidsI thk  is too bad Rowlg didn't just contue wh the fmula f success she had gog f her  Maybe there will be enough backlash that the publisher will do a second edion that matches the qualy of the first three books  the seriesI know that I won't be  as big of a rush to buy book 5
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  I thought thgs couldn't get any wilder after readg Prisoner of Azkaban boy was I wrong  I am a twenty year old college juni  I love these books  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  was phenomenol!  There is so much   I can beg to expla  all  The same creative imagation behd all her other books is  this one  the themes of friendship hon  sheer bravery are displayed well  The  only thg about this book is  does have an edge to  where Voldemt  returns  he's really nasty but dividual kids can determe f  themselves whether they can hle   not  I read this book wh 36  hours  the last seven chapters I could not put down  This book four is  a wner  now I am eagerly anticipatg book five!  Help!
I bought this f my daughter's birthday  Sunday July 9th we were neck   neck takg turns readg  I fished this mng   was very  wth the read  The sty never dragged  had plenty of chills  Harry  is really developg  I like readg about him growg  changg   learng  Knowledge is power  The library is a great place to grow  I  thk my kids will get good lessons from the book  Lookg fward to the  next one
This is a must read f Harry Potter fans Even though this book is longer then the last one  is an terestg read  kept me on the edge of my seat JKRowlg has once aga proved to be very imagive creative   funny There is lot me happeng  this book then the previous ones  It is me dangerous much darker  full of spells curses hexes  dragons  you-know-who Harry is growg up to be a brave   considerate wizard takg on tasks f f older wizards In Dumblede's  wds &quotYou have shouldered a grown wizard's burden  found yourself  equal to --&quot Ron  Hermoe are also facg some changes  their  lives I can't say me then that  Goblet of Fire leaves you wantg  me  I completely agree wh others that this book is f every one  JKRowlg has done a wonderful job  I can't wa until the next one  comes out
This book is just as enchantg  excg as the other three Harry Potter has just had another  hrendous summer wh the Dursely's But when the Weasley's ve him to go to the Quiddch Wld Cup the summer takes a turn f the best JK Rowlg weaves a fantastic sty that you won't  be able to put down until you're done JK Rowlg really out did herself  wh this masterpiece of over 700 pages
I can't put this book down - not because 's engagg but because I'm afraid I'll break my foot! This monster tome remds me of &quotGone Wh the Wd&quot (both book  movie) - huge  enjoyable but not nearly  as good as everyone thks  is amidst the chuses of accolades Those  adult readers who are tired of the b wagon might prefer Emerson's essay  on Self Reliance  Eugene Ionesco's play &quotRhocerous&quot
The fourth Harry Potter book was wth the wa!  I could not put  down until I fished readg the entire book  It was not as detailed as the first three books but I found myself stg on the edge of my seat me  than wh any of the others  Readers will fd a few new characters There  is somethg top-secret at the Mistry of Magic that Harry has to fd out  about  You will have to get a copy to read yourself because  I tell any  me  will give the whole book away  It is an AWESOME book!
Harry Potter is fourteen  the latest book  the series reflects his growg matury - &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is longer me tense  me frighteng then the first three books All  of the familiar characters are back  the sty never flags It's to  JK Rowlg's cred that even though Harry is gog through those ackward  teenage years the series is still as great as ever
Book 4 of the Harry Potter series is as ventive  terestg as the previous 3 volumes  however there is a fbodg element to the sty that changes the tone of this series  This may disturb children a ltle  b certaly I was nervous at the end of the book rather than exced f  the contued adventures of Harry Potter
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot lives up to the stards set by the first 3 books  In s 700 pages  never lags  stytellg  suspense Harry Ron  Hermione are 14 now -- which means that while  solvg the mysteries of the Triwizard Tournament dealg wh dragons   houseelves they also have to deal wh school dances There is plenty of  action adventure wizard spts  dangerous encounters  most of the  characters from the previous books are here  If you liked the previous  Harry Potter books this one will have you hooked f good!
was that really just 734 pages?  what an efftless joy  Rowlg is once aga a master of misdirection I'm 0 f 4  predictg who the bad guys really are  It's so hearteng to see that somethg surrounded by such  hype is actually good let alone outstgly wonderful  Let's all cast  an artistic sensibily charm on Mr Chris Columbus  hope that his Harry  Potter movie doesn't go dement on s fmidable audience
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot may very well be the best book  JK Rowlg's fast-growg series The expected lim of only seven books f this fantastic series is almost dissapotg when one stops to reflect that there are now only three new books to be released   the future I read &quotthe Goblet&quot  less than 24 hours   was enchanted every mute From the very first chapter I was hooked: Ld  Voldemt was back  I was captivated by the idea of a Triwizard Tournament  between Hogwarts School Durmstrang Instute  Beauxbatons Academy   when Harry's name was mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire as a fourth  contender I knew that Harry Potter book #4 was clearly the best of the  bunch The bizarre twists  turns along the chapters had me guessg what  on earth Rowlg would thk of next JK Rowlg contues to  surprise  astound me  I am posive her next book  the Potter  series will be anythg but dissapotg! I can't wa!
This book  my opion was the best of the 4 Harry Potter books out by far! There are so many new ideas  this book I dont know how JK Rowlg is gog to be able to make the other books just as good!  I'm sure  knowg her talent she will be que able to conjour up new ideas  no  time! I dont want to say much about the sty le but I will say this  this sty has a mix of everythg f everyone! The end of the book is  scary but the rest of the book is very excg wh twists  turns   irony all over the place! I cant wa f the 5th book!
This a  truly great book that will provide kids wh hours of fun This whole series is absoltuly fantastic  I highly reccomend them  I am not one who nmally fanatocally re-reads a book many times but I sure have  wh this series readg each book 4+ times The books will take you to  the magic school of Hogwarts where you follow phaned wizard Harry Potter  throught his days of fun  excement  Harry is selected f the  Triwizard tournament a competion between three schools  the book  follows his explos durg the tournament
I've read up to chapter 27  already I thk this is the best of the four  In his fourth year Harry learns much about friendships  house-elves  There is yet another Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher  along wh a whole cast of new  excg characters I haven't put the  book down sce yesterday when I got   This is defely the best!
This book is great! I would advise every one to read The only problem is  gets a ltle scarey near the end of the book I wont tell you what happens that is scarey but the scarey part is near the end It didnt scare me but i am 13 so  wouldnt but f younger kids i would recomend skippg  that part   you are the parent  you are readg  to your child you  might want to change that part so that  isnt as scarey i thk that kids  8-16 would enjoy this book the most
harry  the weasleys fally go to the Quiddch wld cup wh a terririsg end harry starts his next year  hogwarts  meets the new teacher the triwizard championships start   he fds his first love  A  wonderful book the best  the series so far!
When I picked up the first book I couldn't put  down! When Iread the 2nd book  thrilled me so much I wanted to read the 3rdbook! Now JK Rowlg has done  aga wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of FireIn this book Harry Hermione  Ron go off f another year at Hogwarts  The school is havg a competion of wizards  to enter you had to put your name  a goblet of fire  Harry got  by someone 4 champions were chosen  go on excg adventures
I would highly recommend this book I don't know  you ever get migrae headaches but I've had one all weekend from summer school yet I still couldn't put this book down The mystery is so enthrallg the adventure  so excg  the fantasy so spelllbdg that  makes a very easy yet  enjoyable read  The reader cannot help but relate to Harry's problems even  though they're a wld apart That's probably what is so unique about the  book: Although  very obviously happens  an alternate realy where  magic happens the people could easily be real  Comg of age  prejudice  power hungress  hate are all the same issues  Harry's wld as   ours  Anyways the only thg I was disappoted about was that the endg  was less than emotionally fulfillg  Yet beg the turng pot  the  series I cannot thk of anythg else that could have made sense  Hence  5 stars hence read the book
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot leads readers through the common twists  turns of Potter's le-- Rowlg does a good job of maturg Harry  his friends now fourteen years old by addg elements such as crushes a few fresh remarks  other signs of adolescence Although the  plot characters  elements were superb I would not recommend this book  to readers under the age of ten  Rowlg said that Harry's adventures  would be gettg darker  me mature  she wasn't lyg  This book  deals wh some pretty heavy stuff but PLEASE don't let that deter you!  Harry  his friends are still gettg to tons of mischief  havg  lots of fun  hey wh two characters like Fred  Gege Weasley the  book couldn't possibly be that mbid In my opion this is the best  book  the series  I can't wa to read  aga!
I am readg Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire And beliveme s a great bookEven  U have to get up really early  themg to get  s wth  Its full of HumAction Adventure I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys the series
This was an terestg book  The book seems better wren then the others  I didn't like the endg that much though  Killg Diggy was  kd of wierd  It also seems like Cho's character could be me devloped  This one ties f best wh the third one
In the contug saga of Harry Potter we are off to year 4 at Hogwarts!  A delightful book f childeren of all ages  The Goblet of Fire is full of the excement we have come to expect  New characters to meet  old  friends return the plot twists all the time  But sry no spoilers from  me!  All I can say is  you have not started this series today is the  day! If you have then you probably already have the book  h
Harry Potter IV is wth 's weight  gold! This book is better than the first three It fully lives up to all the hype  expectations that have  surrounded ! This sty was so rivettg that even after 720 pages I  still wanted me Some of the mystery surroundg the Harry/Voldemt  relationship has been lted But this has only whetted the appete f  me Harry Potter Way to go Joanne! I can't wa f the next stallment
Sure led up to all the hype  Don't want to give away the endg so all I want to tell you is that 's a great book  Believe me  you like any of the first three you'll love this!
I thought this book was wonderful!  The sty had imagative twists  turns wh the same loveable characters ( some very unloveable ones!) savg the day  It was very well developed  lent hours of fun   excement!
Great book but much darker than the previous 3  The entire sty has an underlyg gloomyness that might not be appropriate f younger readers  I couldn't put  down  Got the book Saturday at noon  fished  Sunday  at midnight  The endg leaves enough unfished sty les that I am now  &quotpatiently&quot wag f book 5
Rowlg just gets better  better  I have read the first three books  the Goblet of Fire's style is me complex  excg than the others  It is somewhat dauntg to read all 700+ pages of this new book  especially f kids but 's defely wth 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire provides an engrossg midpot to this phenomenal series gatherg up threads from the past  feshadowg the role of Harry  his friends  an creasgly adult  future  The magic  this book is spired delightful   some cases  hryg  The magic of the entire series is s abily to ptray the  challenges of growg up  of usg responsibly the awesome powers of  the adult wld  This book vividly ptrays those who have met the  challenge those who have failed  the wld-alterg consequences of  such failure  Although this book is full of mischievous magic that will  delight children  also contas curses hexes  a climactic graveyard  scene that may terry them  It touches on death tture racism  genocide "human" rights the nature of power  evil self  These  themes however  are balanced by compassion friendship loyalty  maly family  love  The Harry Potter series troduces young  children to the "dark" wld that adults have created but also shows them  that they have the power to reshape the wld to their likg  Questions  of how to use this ultimate magic are raised throughout this book   Answers however are rare  That is a task f adults  f the rest of  the series
This Harry Potter book is the most enjoyable yet  I like howpeople who have never read a Harry Potter book would underst whatis gog on  this sty  All of my fave characters returned  added a new twist to the sty  I liked how they still attended Hogwarts  got  to all the trouble just like  the other books I like the characters reactions to when Harry's name was called fm the Goblet of Fire  Over all i say that this book is f poeple of all ages bacause the language is not dficult  the sty le is AWESOME!  Although this sty was longer then the other books  would not of been the same   was shter
JK Rowlg has done  aga  While the 752 pages may be dauntg f some they are well wth the time (I pretty much did nothg but read f two days)  Whout revealg anythg about the book I will say that   is absolutely wonderful  I highly recommend   The only questions left  is when is Book 5 comg out?
Harry Potter's newest adventure is just as full of excement  drama as his last three  not me soI first started readg Harry Potter on a dark  stmy night when I was alone  the house  The book was my ltle sister's  as I was bed out of my md I picked  up   began to readI am an avid  enthusiastic reader  I fished the  309-page book the next day  I was utterly enthralled by the wonderfully  three-dimensional characters fantastic plot  most of all by the  stunng language use  I am really a name person  when I saw names  like Albus Dumblede Sirius Black  Hermione Granger I was hooked  I  have followed Harry's edge-of-your-seat adventures from the time he was  eleven to the present  each book (Harry Potter  the Scerer's  Stone Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secrets  Harry Potter  the  Prisoner of Azkaban) proved me excg than the lastAuth J K  Rowlg's newest book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is no  exception  Like 's predecesss the plot slowly wds self to a  hopeless knot of mystery--the reader is totally baffled as to the solution  Then wh somethg ak to Sherlock Holmes everythg falls to place  resultg  a dazzlg climax  This 752-page book sets the stage f a  future climax me dramatic than anythg we've seen befeThe sty  begs as the old caretaker of &quotThe Riddle House&quot wnesses a  strange scene: someone called Wmtail is havg a conversation wh an  anonymous hissg voice  They are plottg death  Thouss of miles  away Harry Potter awakes the small lightng-shaped scar on his fehead  burng like fireThere are me strange occurrences--riotg  fear  at the Quiddch Wld Cup unexplaable disappearances  deaths  The  dread Ld Voldemt is becomg stronger buildg his power f a fresh  attack on wizard-kd  there is only one person to stop himHarry  Potter mdg his own busess at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry is suddenly mysteriously entered  the Triwizard Tournament a  competion between the three greatest wizards  the three greatest  European Wizardg schools: Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang  Exposed  to terrible danger he competes  three seemgly impossible tasks but  nothg can prepare him f his confrontation wh his lelong  enemyHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was thoughly un-putdown-able   thoughly wonderful  I especially enjoyed the ltle tidbs dropped  enticgly throughout the sty--tidbs about the characters' pasts  There are also still some unsolved mysteries--but of course the biggest one  of all is: Will Harry Potter manage to defeat the Dark Ld?Harry  Potter mdg his own busess at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft   Wizardry is suddenly mysteriously entered  the Triwizard Tournament a  competion between the three greatest wizards  the three greatest  European Wizardg schools: Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang  Exposed  to terrible danger he competes  three seemgly impossible tasks but  nothg can prepare him f his confrontation wh his lelong  enemyHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was thoughly un-putdown-able   thoughly wonderful  I especially enjoyed the ltle tidbs dropped  enticgly throughout the sty--tidbs about the characters' pasts  There are also still some unsolved mysteries--but of course the biggest one  of all is: Will Harry Potter manage to defeat the Dark Ld?
After havg just spent all of last night to the wee hours of the mng readg the last 300 pages of &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot I must say JK Rowlg has outdone herself Harry Potter's fourth year is defely his most tense year as not only does he have to  deal wh learng me magic puttg up wh Draco  his friends but  Harry is begng to notice girls  the way they make him feel I was  totally spellbound through the whole book as I was made to feel a whole  range of emotions from excement  happess to beg scared  angered  f all the thgs that can happen to a famous wizard who knows so ltle  about the wizardg wld Harry says  the book that he sometimes felt  that somebody put a spell on time to move at a speed faster than nmal   I hope somebody does that f me so that I can contue wh Harry  his  education  experiences at Hogwarts  Book V sooner than I thk
The long awaed sequel to Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban is here at last  This book tled Harry Potter  the Gobblet of Fire is as  even me climatic  fun filled as the other three Potter books  JK Rowlg has truely out done herself  this particular book  It displays  many twists  turns as the other Harry Potter books  not many me   There are new surprises as well as new characters addg to the previous  ones  I give this book four stars  two thumbs up  This is a book I  will share  truely recomend to children  adults of all ages  I  myself wish that JK Rowlg contue to wre about Harry Potter  his  le as first a student of Hogwarts then his future job  contug  wh the rest of his le  This is a very extradary book  I hope  all of you will enjoy  as much as I did
In Harry Potter's new adventure(don't wry I won't ru )  there are many twists  turns  very terestg sty plot  Despe what many thk JK Rowlgs novel of about 730 pages would have been much less  terestg  she had cut  down to only about 300-500 pages  JK  Rowlg's sties have captured us from the first book to the 4th  stallment of the series  On behalf of children ( adults) everywhere  readg this book I give JK Rowlg  Harry a stg ovation  Hoay f Harry!
wow - i didn't thk  could get much better than book 3 buti was wrong! i bought the book friday at midnight  had fished by sunday!  couldn't put  down!  is a ltle &quotdarker&quot than the others because harry is grawg up  can hle me but there are some hillarious moments too especially volvg the house elves  who can fget the quiddch wld cup! all  all a great book can't wa f #5 harry rocks!
My son got the book (he was first  le) at 9 am  wasfished by 2:30  I didn't read  que so fast but I loved  justas much!  Another terric book!  As a teacher I appreciate anyone who can motivate kids to read  JK Rowlg goes WAY beyond motivation
The Goblet of Fire was an excellent book once i started icouldn't put the book down (except to eat  sleep) After fishgthe book  two days i can't wa f book number five And i recemend this book f anyone who can read
this book was great like all the others but  a ltle me tese  some might thk some parts are scary =P the summary is kd of complicated but ill try to expla  mostly s about an event at hogwarts thats  takg place   hasent been held f a hundred years because some  people have died from  to make sure no one gets seriously jured only  people ages seventeen  above can enter but someone enters harry  the  contest anyway  he gets chosen the antagonists  this book turn out  dferent than i expect the plot is me tricate  you will discover  some thgs about voldemt
While this book started off a ltle slow (the first chapter not that great) the rest of the book was fantastic  I recieved my book from Amazon  at noon on Saturday  have spent the last 30 hours readg  every spare  mute  As usual the dialogue  characters are greatProbably the  best of the series
I luv harry potter We Even have the same birthday JULY 31!  This book is the best Ican't wa until #5! 1
This is  seems where Rowlg is tryg to draw the le wh her series She's long sisted that the Harry Potter are not f young children But up to this pot they've really been fe Thgs change  here The bad guys are truly bad  the climax of this book is posively  terryg By the end the nature of the Harry Potter books has been  fundamentally changed  's become a lot darkerThat said the book  is absolutely fantastic The characters have grown up a lot sce the  Scerer's Stone   shows here The plot is much me epic hence 's  rather massive page count That said  was sufficiently rivettg that I  found myself tearg through the book  less than a dayThen aga  's not like a review is gog to change your md one way  the other  If you loved the first three this book is wonderful If you didn't you're  wrong
This was an amazgfantastic book  The suspence when Harry  Ron went out to talk to Hogrid  the vesdabilaty clock was by far the best eye catcher that I have ever read  all my le  readg books  I am not a  pro  readg books but I have read many  some were dull but  Harry  Potter was by far the best book I have ever read
I had read speculative articles about this book befe  was released sayg that  was darker  tone  perhaps less appropriate f children  I &quotpre-read&quot  so that I could decide whether  not  my son should read  (although I would have wanted to read  anyway after  thoughly enjoyg the first three!)  It is clear that Ms Rowlg has  carefully planned all of Harry's seven years of Hogwarts adventures   this novel seems to be a pivotal pot  the contug sty of the  series requirg the addion of some dangerous plot elements  Although  as an adult reader I look fward to seeg resolutions of these dangers   later books young children may fd this book me frighteng than the  first three  The tricately detailed wizardg wld contues to  delight through vivid descriptions me mature development of  relationships  nonstop action  It is a wonderful addion to the  series
This is the most excellent book I have ever read  In my opion  is the best of all four Harry Potter's  The auth truly showcases her immense genious wh a complex  terestg plot  vivid new  characters as well as the unbeatable previous Hogwarts staff  students  not to mention the ever present Dursleys Someone certaly has que an  imagation! The longevy of the book was never a problem at all  I  fished   about three days  was still hungry f me  This is a  must-read sty  I would recommend  to everyone ages 11  up  cludg adults  Younger children will defely not underst    will be scared at some parts  Other than that this is a great read---the  series will become classics  I can't wa f the fth edion!
I have to adm I was one of the crazy adults who couldn't wa to get his hs on the new Harry Potter book  I read  over the weekend  now I can't wa f the 5th stallment to fd out how Harry can top  thisThe darkest of the Harry Potter books this sty brgs Harry face  to face wh you-know-who  one of the recurrg characters dies  It is  not f the weak hearted  The themes of bravery  friendship run through  this stallment just as  the earlier books (I could have done whout  Hermione's pc campaign agast house-elf &quotslave lab&quot  though!)Although this was not my fave of the four books  was a  great read  I would highly recommend  to any Harry Potter fan  If  you have not read the other books however be sure  read those first  as this book would be dficult to underst
Amid the media hoopla surroundg this fourth stallment of _Harry Potter_ 's easy to get a b skeptical about Ms Rowlg's purpted powers of penmanship  But all 700--some-odd pages live up to the hype   anticipation - this is a GOOD BOOK!  It's lovely to revis all the  old Hogwarts' tradions  characters that have grown  the first three  books  Harry Ron  Hermione are unmistakably older  experience new   trigug problems  their social lives but their personalies (  sense of hum) rema unaltered In addion we are troduced to some  new  wonderfully outrageous characters who happen to also play an  trsic part  the style  we get to enjoy some very ventive  magic But the best thg about this book is defely the plot  Every  seemgly rom tidb laid down throughout the book swoops together f a  breathtakg fal hundred pages  It's so satisfyg not to have to wry  about loose ends  I don't want to give anythg even remotely specic  away - just enough to make you read the book  The fal battle is very  excg very suspenseful very evil And as I'm sure mothers wld  over as well as the mng talkshows will appreciate all kds of good  mal values are sprkled throughout the book - wholesome but not preachy  thrillg but not terryg wh a similar structure to the previous  three books but not  the least predictable  Rowlg fally reveals  how to pronounce Hermione's name!
I really thought that this was the best Harry Potter yet  Iread   only two days  I wouldn't talk to anyone because I wasso absbed    It's really suspensful [the end] is really a surprise I have to get the fth one!  I LOVED THIS BOOK!
This book is a great addion to the Potter series   contues to tell the sty of Harry Potter a 14 year old wizard There are lots of odd new characters  some very bone-chillg events that take place  the  book And yes deed Harry does fall  love  there is a death   this but  I gave any names  would spoil some of the fun of readg  this book! I urge you to read this book as soon as you can!
Well  took me a while to buy to the Harry Potter craze I was determed to last out as long as possible but I fally caved  a month  so ago  ended up readg the first three books  the series  one  weekend  As a child I loved the Chronicles of Narnia  the children's  books by Roald Dahl I found Rowlg's Potter series to be no less  enjoyable although her style is que dferent from both Lewis  Dahl  I felt I might be disappoted wh the fourth stallment because I've  come to expect so much of the series Thankfully I was not Whether  is  because I know  love the characters now  because this book is even  better than the first three I loved ! And I could not believe that I had  gotten through over 700 pages of   still wanted me Admtedly  there is a lot of explanation of background material as wh the other  three books  often what seems obvious is spelled out but this makes  sense considerg that the series is wrten primarily f children (but  enjoyed by all!) So regardless of what some crics may say I thk that  the only thgs Rowlg encourages wh this series are the love of readg   the desire to be brave fair  kd-hearted I'd say that  you  haven't bought your copy yet buy  now Trust me you won't regret 
Once aga JK Rowlg provides us wh a most exhiliratg  satisfyg tale as she leads our beloved hero through his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizadry  Though as rumed the book is  signicantly darker ( longer) than the first three  retas the  hum imagation  charm that have become the auth's signature  Rowlg also does an admirable job  developg her returng characters   their relationships wh each other- expect love triangles of all  sts!  My only qualms wh this otherwise delightful adventure would be  wh s lengthess (a me tightly-kn sty would have creased s  appeal)  s endg (which I found a b unconvcg)  All  all  however a great sty which will convce all s readers that  was  wth the wa
I LOVE this book 's no wonder 's sellg so well everyone whos picked up a Harry Potter book doesn't put  down until they're done JK Rowlg has created a magical wld wh terestg character foods spts   me!  When you pick up a Harry Potter book you pick up a new le wh  wizards wches ghosts spells  TONS of adventres! This is a great  book a ltle long but each page is wth !  I recomend this book to  anyone!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was an excellent sequel tothe previous books  the series It was full of twists  turns many surprises to keep the reader turng the pages as quickly as they could to see what danger awaed Harry  his fourth year at Hogwarts I thoughly enjoyed   am sure that any Harry Potter fan will also
I have to adm I'm not a pre-teen  a teenager anyme  I'm 23 but I fell  love wh the Harry Potter sties after a friend that is younger than I am impled me to read the sties I did fish the first 3  one  week  I fished the goblet of fire  one day (I'm a pretty fast  reader!)  the sty is a grippg sty a lot of fun to read I won't  say too much about the plot because kids  adults alike should read this  sty The readers may notice that Harry  Ron  Hermione are startg  to grow up  change a ltle b developg crushes on the oppose sex   have to deal wh the issue of death  as expected a tra  the  midst of Hogwarts Of course Ms Rowlg always likes to lead the reader to  believe that one character should be guilty of the heous crimes that have  terrized the student body but the truth does prevail!It's OK to buy  the book f yourself  you are old enough to drive  vote Most  grown-up novels are not this much fun  encourage you to use your  imagation!Now I'm wag f Book #5  Cheers to Ms Rowlg f  breathg le  telligence to books f children
When I read this ( one stg-- all 734 pages) I actuallyfound myself yellg at some of the me annoyg characters mymuscles clenchg up at excg  my eyes waterg up at all the right parts JK has wrten her best book yet! This one really takes you &lti&gt&lt/i&gt to the wld of wizards  wches The Dark fces are back  as mean cunng  downright cruel as ever JK's wds pat a perfect picture of what's happeng what thgs look like as the Amazon review says I just hae one piece of advice-- drop everythg you're dog  read this book You won't regret 
Rowlg is consistently brilliant  She adds new characters puts new sps on old faves  allows the children (Harry Ron  Hermione) to age to crushes ambions  rivalriesBe warned this is tense  You know who is back  after Harry  The danger is real The stakes are  high  A great read f kids  adults -- just like books 1-3
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a great book I loved  me then all the other Harry Potter books The book is filled wh great twists   surprises You never know what's gog to happen All the new characters  are great  excg A lot of parts  the book are scary This year at  Harry's school there is somethg that's happeng that hasn't happened f  over 100 years Will this somethg lead to tragedy  gly? You'll fd  out  you read Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire
I read the book  less than one  a half days I am 13 yearsold  I had hated the series befe Then my mom read me a few pagesfrom the first book  I was stantly hooked I read every book me than once  nearly hugged the delivery guy when he delivered the book It was so cool how Harry gets past Ld Voldemt aka You-Know-Who It was so much me dferent than the other books because  st of delves to Harry's psyche He faces the constant pressures of fame especially when Ron his best friend thks Harry is just  the Triwizard Tournament f me fameI felt Harry's pa when everyone starts gettg angry at him The task's were cool sce Harry had to escape a Hungarion Hntail rescue his friends underwater  fight his way to the Triwizard Cup I got scared sce Voldemt is back  wonder how they will stop him All  all  was the best book yet I can't wa f the other books to come out
My first impressions of this book were BIG I was expectg to see a book about 400 pages but to see 600 I was so exced I started to read the book straight away  f 10 hours I didn't put the book down Rowlg has aga made a book that once you start can not put down from the first to the  last wd I was gripped  the Harry Potter wld I was like I was  the  book  is a feelg no other book has given me the emotions of the  characters flowed to me It was just as excg as befe As like the  other books all the tension built up to the end  was amazg!  Every body   my family reads the Harry Potter Books My Dad is one of Harry's biggest  fan There is always a fight to see you reads  first but to sum  all  up this was  the same league as all the rest of the books  maybe the  best yet
This book was the best out of all four!   I got  the day  came out  I haven't put  down sce(Lerally)  The book is about the Tri-Wizard Tournament at school  Only children above 17 are allowed to  enter  The tournament goes on between 3 wizardg schools Hogwarts  Durmstrang  Buexbatons  One champion from each school will be chosen  out of the Goblet of Fire which judges which of the entries are most wthy  to participate f their school  Somehow Harry's name has been put    he has been chosen!   He now must compete  3 dangerous tasks  Harry  wks through out most of the school year preparg f these tasks  The  book remas excg throughout  I would advise anyone who liked the  other three books to buy this as soon as possible to read you'll love   as much as you loved the others!
Though this book might seem long  is an expertly created f young mds like me  The plot is rather twisted wh enough hum to be hilarious There are some surprises however  F example who dies  who goes out  wh who  I urge any one young  old to read this book
I just fished Goblet of Fire  I must say  was que captivatg from start to fish From chapter one on Goblet delivered all I expected from this highly anticipated thriller As f all the hype about   becomg scarier I will not compla about this fact but commend  It  gives older readers the oppurtuny to underst  love Rowlg's  wrg (as I've always done) And wh younger ones this gives them a  peek to the creative twist of wds Joanne is capable of weavg to a  serious yet hilarious sty I agree Ron Gege  Fred are very funny   Hermione becomes me darg  dependent wh each book At her  character's wonderful display I fd myself wantg to jo SPEW   helpg the unjust wld of house-elves At the end when Rowlg semi-sums  up the sty but leaves a clfhanger lyg open I found myself  breathless wag impatiently f the release date of book five (When is   anyway?) This is a wonderful display of creative wrg that JK poises  so carefully to this 734 page masterpiece A thous stars is an  under-ratg f how good this is!
I have just fished The Goblet of Fire after readg the first three books  I had wried that like long-anticipated sequels to films the new book might lose somethg  Rowlg's eagerness to deliver  Never  fear--as Harry Potter becomes creasgly skilled at his craft so does  Rowlg  The new tale has been woven even me richly than the others   cludes noticable elements of comedy  tragedy mal issues  huge  leaps  Harry's evable comg-of-age  The characters contue to  develop as real people  the fantastic touch which drew readers like  myself to the first books never wavers from the first page to the last  The volume is defely huge  comparison to the others don't let the  thickness daunt you  Readers of every age need a sizable stallment to  keep themselves busy until the next comes   In a wd 's splendid  Thank you J K Rowlg!
Any book that has kids exced about readg is wth the hype  this is 4  a row f JK Rowlg  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is another wonderful book  JK Rowlg contued her series wh the same  engagg entertag characters  another credible plot  If you  aren't familiar wh this series start wh the first  settle  f a  fabulous adventure  You won't want to put them down until you're fished  And you will want to read them aga  aga  The Harry Potter series  has children of all ages enthralled  The teraction between Ron   Hermione is priceless  their fourth year  Harry's strength of character  showed as he faced the challenges  The Fourth Year at Hogwarts has me (  many of my friends) already wag impatiently f the Fth!
At first I thought Harry Potter was the auth of a bunch of books  that was why he was famousBut after beg dead bed ( is summer) my mom bought me oneThis book is altle darker then the othersbut still  greatTies up alot of loose ends
After the second Harry Potter book people were sure the third would be a let down  After the third was great people thought  would be the fourth that was bad  Ftunetely f Potter fans everywhere Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire is anythg but a let downThe pattern is contued  from the other books but wh changes  F the first time the book  begs wh the first chapter not wh Harry  But  does get to him  havg a b me trouble than he might like  He does go back to the  Burrow wh Ron  has a good time at the Quidethch Wld Cup but once  aga other mysterious thgs happen there  When Harry Returns to  Hogwarts people are not que as friendly as he had hopedWhat about  this mystery gog on?  Will Harry's love Cho Chang ever notice him?  And  what about Profess Trewlany's Prediction?  Read to fd out!
As I was wag to pick up my copy at Midnight Friday  occurred to me that a cruel jokester might walk away from the clerk pretend to skim through the book  then shout out to the 300  so Harry fans &quotMy  God!  She killed off Hagrid!&quot  Ron  Hermione As callous as  may  seem I don't thk anyone will really care about the person that died  The victim was well chosen as the name will certaly be used as a  rallyg call like &quotRemember the Alamo&quot over the next several  books  there will certaly be implications f Harry's love le  Which brgs up the biggest dference about this book that is the  troduction of sex  Not explic sex but multiple allusions to teenage  passions past  present  What wh the route treatment of gamblg   office polics the Goblet of Fire is by far the most mundanely adult  of the series To wrap up - the book starts out as less of a st-alone  than the others  feels off until the scene shts back to Hogwarts  The  last 150 pages  so are outstg  mer prompt re-readg
Ms Rowlg just seems to get better  better  F months Ihave been tellg people about the Harry Potter series  It is trulythe most enjoyable one I have ever read  now the fourth book appears surpasses all of the others!  Her development of the characters is simply exquise  the plot is the grest of the four by far Certaly this is a dferent st of book  has many darker moments  themes  I firmly believe however that these greatly enhance the novel they make the plot far richer  me spellbdg (I read   eight non-stop hours)  My thanks to Ms Rowlg f producg such an amazg series of books (once of the few I have truly been able to lose myself )  You MUST read this series (especially #4)  is a breath of fresh air  an creasgly complicated wld
The fourth out of seven Harry Potter book is arguably the best one yet Beg the longest one yet you have me time to enjoy this great book The  book is about Harries fourth year at Hogwarts(the wizard school)  an old  tournament is to be held wh one champion representg each school Harry  whout enterg himself is surprisgly on the list as a fourth cidate  Nobody can expla  It is all the plan of Ld Voldemt(dark wizard) to  get Harry  to have his vengeance Harry will have to get out of this  mess whout any help Can he make ? This book is a must read f all  Harry Potter fans  any other person that likes readg good books  recommended f ages 11  up
AWESOME! This book looked big when I got  but I started  right away I read f hours straight   was great! The same  better then the  good  previous books   had a really good plot! Lots of twists turns   mysteries! It st of gives you clues f you to wk out along the  way! I would reccomend this book to anyone!
JK Rowlg (that Publishg Industry euphemism f Gold) has outdone herself aga just when we thought  was impossible This book is a wthy bearer of the Harry Potter name  tells all of us that when we dered   advance we were trustg our stcts perfectly Me than  that  tells us that we were right  dog so- which is probably the  most wonderful feelg  the wld!It all starts when Mrs Weasley  decides to call Harry f the Quiddch Wld Cup held this time   Bra Harry is off  runng befe you can say &quotCatch That  Snch&quot What follows is a Quiddch banquet that will delight any  connosieur There are a lot of ternational teams this time  this  almost turns to a carnival  However this is dampened slightly when one  fds that there will be no ter-house Quiddch matches But wa  Befe you groan there's some good news- Inter School matches!  As anyone  who's read Enid Blyton knows these are THE big moments of any school year   these show a rare display of Hogwarts spir agast two rival  wizardg schools who've come from other placesThere are of course  lots of other good parts here I particularly loved ther new  Defence-Agast-The - Dark Arts- teacher  Harry's sudden  much  awaed terest  girls It was a slight let down  parts but I must  adm that there are terestg moments when Harry tries to figure out  what the upwardly mobile young wizard must do to get that cute ltle wch  to accompany him to the Yule Ball I'm not gog to be a total spoilspt   tell you her name- you'll have to read  f yourself of course- but  trust me 'll remd you of the first time you fell  love!So just  what is wrong wh this book? Somehow there was somethg that just didnt  gel The plot is tight- Alistair MacLean would have killed to have a plot  this nerve-wrackg-  the wrg style is rich sweepg  wonderfully  textured  Rowlg's imagation has only got better-  that could have  been thought possible!  But somehow the book seems a ltle disientgIt's dficult to put my fger on  but the most obvious reason is  that this is above all a very DARKvery sister very ADULT book  Adult There I've said  The first three Harry Potters wked  beautully because they were wrten f children Us grown-ups- when we  read them- were taken back to that wild exhiliratg ride that we called  childhood The previous books provided a gateway f us to just get out of  this wld- wh all 's ups  downs especially downs-   to go back  to an Enid-Blytonesque nocence This book on the other hhas a  darker me gloomy tge almost approachg that other epic The Ld of  the RgsI'm not sayg that Rowlg has sold out  gone  wrten  a book f adults stead of children It's just that this book seems to  have been wrten after the Harry-Potter-is-good-f-adults-too phase when  a lot of adults unabashedly declared themselves Potterphiles Children too  can relate to this book superbly but brgg  topics like Death( well  you knew there'd be one- just whose you'll have to wa  see)   Teen Mushess st of spoilt what was an otherwise excellent series f  me  Call me old fashioned call me a purist but I somehow wasn't too  comftable wh the idea of these ADULT themes gettg to a Harry Potter  book It isnt as  the sty is bad- I'm already wag f Book 5- but  there's a small part of me that wishes that Rowlg had contued to wre  her &quotonly f kids aged 8-12&quot  Boardg School masterpiecesng's imagation has only got better-  that could have  been thought possible!

Well I will adm  I'm not your &quotltle kid&quot :)  I was glad to great my copy of the book along wh my we  have greatly enjoyed &quotGoblet of Fire&quot has fally supplanted the first book as  my fave of the series  Well wrten Goblet of Fire may be what   takes to prove to non-Harry followers what the craze is all  aboutOfferrg a great course  character growth Ron Hermoe  Harry  all of the others exhib changes as they grow another year  The troduction of &quotcrushes&quot a &quotboy-girl dance&quot  a  few other elements really set the stage: Harry is growg up  thgs  are changgAlong wh this a fantastic plot revolvg around the  Tri-Wizards tournament develops truly volvg  while the challenges  are terestg to themselves what's even better is how much we learn  about each of the characters  how they hle each of the  challengesA fantastic book  a sure fire wner f kids from 9 to  90
What a wonderful book!  I loved the first three  this fourth stallment lived up to my expectations  Though the length may timidate some (at over 700 pages  is double to triple the length of each previous  book) the book is so engrossg that I found myself unable to put  down  I fished   two days much to my disappotment (now I have to wa  another year f Book 5)!  By the way I am a 30ish woman wh a degree   Lerature--Harry Potter isn't just f kids!
This Harry Potter book is me af a unique book than all the others because they get to teract wh other schools besides hogwarts  harry gets a girlfriend s really a great book f all ages of people to enjoy   tells me about hogwarts histy  s the best one yet I thk!
It seemed hard to believe that Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire could live up to all of the hype  secrecy surroundg   But  did  Book Four contas many fave characters (Harry Dumblede Hermione the  Weasly's Sirius etc)  not-so-faves (Voldemt the Malfoy's  Snape etc) while troducg many new ones  While the first 3  4 pages  are just settg the scene the rest of the book builds  tensions   suspense until  reaches s climax as the end of the Hogwarts draws near  The end is marked by tragedy f Hogwarts (especially Hufflepuff) but is  also deliciously scary  full of magic  I began readg as soon as the  book arrived on our dostep  I couldn't put  down!  The 700+ pages  may seem timidatg at first but once you get started  doesn't seem  nearly that wrong because everythg ties together both  the book   between books  Now the only question is: Can the fth book get any better  than this?
This book was excelent It had everthg from danger to romance I say that  was wth teh weight  I am eageraly awatg the next book
I really enjoyed the book!  I received the book yesterday (via amazoncom)  I tried my best to sav to let  lastbut alas!  I kept turng the pages  befe I knew  I had fished the book!  Because  went so fast you know that  is good!  Wonderfully wrten  great mal lessons f children (such as the value of friendship stg  up f what you thk is right)   hs close to home f what young  people  that age range experience (such as early heart pangs wh respect  to datg)
This book was the best of the series wh plenty adventure  mystery There were plenty of twists to keep you terested  also to keep you terested! Many previous questions set by the previous three books are  readily answered  this novel  many chillg events help stem the flow  of questions one might ask Very well wren book!
This is another of JK Rowlg's wonderful booksI must say I was very surprised wh the content of the book  I'll try not to give away any spoilers but I was surprised at how certa thgs came to pass regardg  Voldemt  I don't thk I'll be givg anythg away to say that I really  liked the TriWizard Tournament  the fact that we got to meet students  from other schoolsKeep  up JK Rowlg  We're eagerly expectg the  rest of the series!
The fourth book  the Harry Potter series makes good use ofs length  Just like the first three books the sty draws you  is very suspenseful  New characters are great  the familiar characters grow  develop me  me  The wld of Harry Potter seems to become darker  wider  scarier while still keepg s sense of hum  magic  But  the first three books the evil of Voldemte was only hted at  now you beg to see just how terrible  was  might become aga  It leaves you wishg you had the next book already- even though the next one is probably gog to be sad  darker still  But The Goblet of Fire is a fantastic book that kids can enjoy on so many dferent levels  It is an imptant read
This book lives up to all of our expectations of the Fourth Harry Potter book This book starts off when Harry getsout of Privet Drive  jos his  friend Ron  Ron's family  the Burrow Then Harry the Weasley's (even  Bill  charlie) Harry's other fred Hermione are off to the  Quiddch Wld Cup After a spectacular game (cludg dancg Veela  from Bulgaria  leprechans from Irel) a crowd of dark wizards  terries everyone at the wld cup  then the Dark Mark is conjured up  ( You-Know-Who's sign)supposedly by Harry's w  After this strange  endg to the quiddch cup the crowd of wizards returns to Hogwarts only  to fd out that there will be no quiddch at Hogwarts this year The  reason f this is that Hogwarts will be hostg the Triwizard tournament   which Hogwarts will be competg wh two other wizardg schools  Beauxbatons  Durmstrong Even though wizards only above 17 can enter  someone (possibly Ld Voldemt) has entered Harry to the mysterious  Goblet of Fire  the Goblet has picked him Harry is bound by a magical  contract to the tournament  to three deadly tasks Will he survive?  While Harry is dreamg of Cho  avoidg Snape he also has somethg  else wryg him  the Triwizard Tournament!
Rowlg does  aga!Book starts wh impact  never lets up  Descriptive wrg is once aga fantastic  Books takes a decidedly me  adult turn  wrg is me tense wh me adult wds  Wrten  knowg adults would be a maj audience f this bookInterestg HP/JC  religious underpngs (IMHO)When is the next one out?AC
This book is new good  beautulwhat can be said about a long awaed book?  Nothg but this:  When readg the first chapter the reader gets taken to a whole perspective of readg everythg from the old le of Tom Riddle to the paralelle universe of Ld  VoldeerYou-Know-Who  We soon fd out what Harry  the rest of  Hogwarts is  ste f  Beg the first to review this book I don't  want to spoil anythg f our younger readers but I can say that  is  chillg to the pot where I almost put the book down but don't  hassle the Wld Cup is great
Simply said this book is AWESOME!  JK Rowlg certaly has a the gt of wrg  Harry  all of his friends are back wh some really good adventures  The book flows smoothly  really keeps you guessg until the end!  In recommend to everyone to READ READ READ this book  you can  get your hs on 
Havg just fished readg &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot this mng I can say whout hesation that the book was wth all the publicy  has been receivg  past weeks At first skeptical as to s content my  attude was changed to one of delight at the first page Harry is wthy  terestg  above all Human! Too often  the fantasy genry we fd  ourselves wh shallow generic characterization The plot is captivatg   me than once I found myself wishg I could escape to Hogwarts   meet Ron Hermione  Dumblede I look fward to any addional books   the series wh acute anticipation  reccomend them to anyone!
I was so exced to get my copy of Goblet of Fire on Saturday (thanks Amazon)  I was not disappoted wh this book at all  In the style of the previous books  the series  was engagg  entertag  a  real page-turner  I read the whole 700+ page book  a weekend because I  was enjoyg  so much  Many of the beloved characters from previous  books are back  the new characters added are very entertag  particularly the new Defense Agast Dark Arts teacher  If you haven't  bought this book yet get  now!  A great read f children  adults  alike I would recommend  to anyone
This fourth book  the Harry potter series was well wth the wa Even after the name change from the Doomsday Tournament to now the Goblet of Fire  didn't change the tone of book JK Rowlg did add some tough vocabulary that I had some trouble wh  I am not even  the age range  of  9- 12 It has a very well thought out plot wh nice twists  turns  It immediately grabs you to the book wh a powerful first chapter Death  is immediate as Ms Rowlg promised But there is a change all you  Quiddch fans you won't read too much about  because the terhouse  tournament is called off this fourth year f Harry Potter  the  TriWizard tournament is put  s place I'm not gonna spoil the endg  but you can probably guess that Harry Potter is gonna have somethg to do  wh  along wh Ron  Hermione And you also know that he will deal  wh Ld Voldermt (You-know-who) So I suggest you cut off the tv   get readg cause  will take you a while  Its 734 pages
I really enjoyed this book  I feel that this is the best of the series probally because  was a whole lot longer than the first three  I fished readg today  the endg was superb  I won't spoil  but   is surprisg  The auth really took her time wh this  made a  wonderful book (I felt that II  III were a b rushed)  Good rich  style lot of twists  surprises  I stongly recommend you to h the  &quotAdd to Shoppg Cart&quot button You won't regret 
There is me energy  this book than any other I was up 'till 3 readg then picked  up f another 5 hours  It is frighteng  is emotional  is not f the fat of heart! It leaves you at the end  wantg to know the rest so badly you can't stop thkg about  f  hours afterward  Defely wth a readg!
but I had to prop  up!  :-)  I'm not 9 to 12 years old so the 752pp didn't faze me a b but I doubt that the Harry Potter juggernaut will be the least b slowed by the lengthy challenge of Book Four: The Goblet of  Fire  What an epic!  Book Four of Seven is the middle of Harry's  adventures   did not disappot  The development of the long-term  characters cludg deeper explation of the dynamics between Harry Ron   Hermione was fabulous  The dual approach to the threat of Ld  Voldemt - his current activies  the histical revelations datg  to Harry's fancy - were well entwed  But the hero himself Harry  Potter age 14 remas the piece de resistance of the series  He  contues to be an affable frustrated complex  complicated teenager -   sht a nmal one f all his possession of Invisibily Cloaks   Magic Ws  JK Rowlgs don't make me wa too long f Book Five -   Six  Seven f that matter!  (And amazoncom thanks f upgradg the  shippg so I could read  whout delay!)
I have read all the Harry Potter books  LOVED them all This one was excellent too It is much longer than the 1st 2end  3rd but you have to read  It was a ltle creepy  I suggest that you be at least 10  years old befe you read  but  is clearly wrten f a st of  younger audience I can't wa f me by the best- JKRowlg
I loved the new harry potter bookYet another masterpiece by JK RowlgIt was just as excg  imagative as the other threeI enjoyed every moment I really missed not havg quiddch matches They  added a lot of excment  adrenale But the other new addion the  triwizard cup was cool  this three (4  this case because harry  potter's name is put  my the bad guy hopimg he'd die)wizards from three  dferent wizardg schools compete f 1000 galleons(dollars   muggle) school pride  Warng f younger readers  parents: This  book is much me tense than the first three Its a ltle b creepier  a ltle b gier  a hogwarts student dies (endg warng) My one  complat  that was most of the book was explag  less action unlike  the other three harry potter books Hey that is my only complat In  conclusion: I loved this one But  wasn't as good as the third one which  is my fave
Well she's done  aga Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is a fun read wh the twists  turns that we've come to expect Don't be put off by the size It can be slow here  there but then the action takes off  aga Some old characters return  there are some terestg new ones  And yes someone we've seen befe dies In fact there are a couple of  deaths  the book (though the others are &quotnew&quot characters) We  also fd out some secrets about Snape  Hagrid The biggest problem wh  the endg of #4 is that  makes me want #5 all that much sooner
You don't need to have an airle ticket to go to some jungle  whatever to have a great journey This book gives you a spectacular adventure WITH Harry Potter (you are not alone havg fun!)  Oh you may ask what so  good about ? It's very very excg! About the Triwizard Tournament the  returng Voldemt oh yeah  The Quiddch Wld Cup wh the best  seeker  the wldVikt Krum! (I can't tell you everythg  I might  spoil your fun!)  Usually a lot of American children don't like to read   's a good chance f them to read! Plus  makes their  imagation fly through the air If you don't buy  you'll probably  regret f the rest of your le (maybe not that long) So buy   NOW!  To show-off a ltle I am a 11 years old gog to be 12  I  fished  yesturday!
Harry Potter IV lived up to every expectation that I had! I would however comment that I am an adult reader  have the matury to hle many of the darker thgs that occur  this book Young readers that love Harry at  11 may need a b me help understg Harry at 14 The curses are  darker the plot is a b me complex  JK Rowlg leaves no doubt  why we should hate the villian If your kids are easily spooked the darker  tone of this book may throw them off a ltle b  BUT as a lover of  lerature the wk is well wrten beautully pieced together  as  funny as always Rowlg seamlessly tells Harry's next adventure   sets the stage f the next three books Remember Harry is gettg older  as each new book is published While he was 11  Book 1 he will be 17   book 7 I LOVE HARRY POTTER but I thk that there are some readers hooked  at 12 that might not be ready to take on some of the ideas held  the  book  Overall a WONDERFUL BOOK as long as the reader is mature enough to  hle the subject matter This book is the series' climax  sets the  stage f the fallg action  conclusion that the last three books are  sure to hold!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great read! I got the book late on friday  could not stop readg  The characters develop me  this 4th book  beg to exhib attractions f the oppose sex Also  their latest adventure is superi to the others  s detail   suspense Rowlg is truly a Wizard!
I'm only half fished wh the 4th stallment of Harry Potter  his Hogwart's pals  I can't put  down!  Not only are the characters maturg  facg new conflicts both wh their magic  wh their relationships the struggles they each face are as compellg as those   the other three books  As much as I want to fish the Goblet of Fire I  don't want Harry's journey to end!
I thouroghly enjoyed this book  I read through  pretty fast  I bought  the day  came out  fished  the day afterwards!  I loved this book even the end were what everyone is hopg will not happen does  Once aga Harry  is visg the Weasley's  they go to the Wld Cup  like they mentioned  the previous book  No surprise there  But  somethg happens at Hogwarts which was never expected   stuff  But I really loved this book  It was the best  I hope you enjoy readg   also  It is one outta a million because of the unique  rare talent  displayed by Rowlg  I hope the other 3 are as good as this one was  Oh  wa!  Only 3? Nooooo! :-)
Yes  was darker  The evil wh which Harry was fced to contend left me shudderg  the fal pages  The characters returned home from another year at Hogwarts at the end of the novel  much me subdued tones  than befe as they became aware of the wickedness  their wld awag  us all  the next stallmentThat beg said there was still much to  smile about  this novel (to help you breath  amongst the darker  moments) I enjoyed the new creatures Hagrid shared wh the students the  latest Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher  the antics of the already  well-known faculty  students of HogwartsI was especially pleased  wh the numerous examples of the emergence of Harry Potter as a teenager  wh convictions about dog what is &quotright stead of what is  easy&quot  as a young man of characterAnother job well done!
This book the fourth  the Harry Potter series was the best yet It was rich  complex  I couldn't put  down I won't give anythg away about the sty because I don't want to ru  f anyone The feelgs  this sty evoked  me were amazg The characters were so genue   wonderful  that I couldn't help but feel f them I strongly reccomend  this book to ANYONE Everyone needs a ltle magic  their lives  this  is a fabulous sce of  Harry Ron Hermoe Hagrid Dumbled Sirus   the rest of the characters are ones that I will never fget  that  everyone should get to know Thank you JK Rowlg f sharg you  briliance
JK Rowlg warned that the 4th book would be darker  she wasn't kiddg It's darker  me complex than the first book but is an excellent next step from the Prisoner of Azkaban The adventures are  maturg right along wh the characters You have to be on your toes to  lk facts like Tom Riddle from previous books to the plot  the latest  which makes  an even me satisfyg read Addional sight to the  characters of Ron Hermione Neville Hagrid  even Snape make this book  even me personal I don't want to give any plotles away this is  defely an excellent pivotal book  the series  I wish I hadn't  fished  already Harry is the center of a thoughtful well-crafted  fascatg tale  I can't wa f Book 5
I received my copy of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire on Saturday afternoon  I'm already startg  f a second time My nephew (who got  on Saturday f his birthday) was so exced that  was comg that  he climbed to the FedEx truck to get his package when  arrived Thank  goodness  was wth both the wa  the hypeThis was a darker book  than the previous three as well as a much longer one but  was also  excg  wth a few hours time that  takes to read  I didn't  realize until this book how good Rowlg is at capturg the tone of nmal  people Her wizards  wches don't just cope wh magical dilemmas   joys they cope wh human ones as well: Harry discovers girls Hermione  discovers boys everybody gets to see the fals f the Quiddch Wld  Cup (spts are eternal) Ron gets tired of beg the eternal sidekick   still they all have to cope wh classes (the new Defense Agast the Dark  Arts teacher is a doozy)  the latest creatures that Hagrid's accquiredI will say that I was disappoted  the heavy-hed racial  understg subplot but sce  eventually tied back to the ma plot  I'll fgive Rowlg this Overall  was well wth readg
We all waed wh bated breath f the tale of Harry's fourth year at Hogwartsthe biggest question was not whether  not Harry would fall  love  whether Hagrid would make  through another year as a profess  The biggest question was whether  not JK Rowlg would be able to  susta the excement the fascation the followg that was generated  by books 1 2  3  I am thrilled to say that she has Rowlg has to be  magical herself to be able to contue at this levelWhout givg  away any of the plot I can confirm: Yes someone does die  no Harry  doesn't fall  love Snape still hates Harry  stoops terribly low to  show his hatred Ron's family is still po Hermione is still livg   the library Malfoy is still provg that Malfoy  malevolent come from  the same Lat rootTo say anythg me would be to ru  f anyone  that hasn't read  yet My only disappotment is that I'll have to wa  so long f the next stallment
a very good book sad at the end but all  all It was very terestg the auth really put some imagative thoughts  to this one
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter Series is not to be missed I won't be cruel  give away ANYTHING not a sgle syllable! This book is tense  deserves every last b of praise  gets! Not one sgle wd  is wasted  's what we expect from this terric auth
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire opens wh Harry  the midst of a frighteng dream  Upon awakeng he discovers the scar on his fehead is burngthe last time this happened Voldemt was nearby  The book is  filled wh mystery  even a b of romance between him  his  &quotcrush&quot ChoChang I fished this book  one day I couldn't  put  down!  I would HIGHLY recommend this book to all Harry Potter  lovers the best yet!
35 stars The wrg is still engagg the characters are still true  consistent  This is one of those necessary tension-buildg middle segments that don't always st by themselves  A lot of time spent upon &quotfeign&quot schools  romances that hopefully will be fleshed out   Books #5-7  The come-to-be-expected classroom dramas  Quiddch  sties were missg  I felt that perhaps a b too much explanation was  required  the &quotconfession&quot towards the end
This eagerly anticipated book has lived up to s hype Eventhough  is signicantly longer than the previous three Harrystallments  is just as engrossg a read Harry contues his adventures at Hogwarts excellg not at Quiddch this time but  the dangerous  excg Triwizard tournament agast students from other wizardg schools However a devious repter  an agent of Voldemt's along wh other captivatg characters are dog their best to help Harry w-  to help him die I highly recommend this book along wh the three previous Harry books A wd of caution however- this book is slightly darker than the earlier books-  has me violence cludg some agast Muggles  someone actually dies Younger children could possibly be scared Besides that 's a great book Brg on the next three!
One of Ms Rowlgs' most extradary achievements is that each book  the Harry Potter series is better than the last  the fourth stallment is no exception  The heft of a 750 page volume may seem timidatg (can  a child even lt this thg?) yet the auth makes use of the exped  length to ratchet the emotional tensy of the series to a new level  particularly  the later part of the bookAs always the characters   descriptions  the book are rich  engagg  her imagation is  so wonderfully developed that the wld she wres about is as much alive  as our own  that of any of the great fantasy wrers  Even me  rewardg the auth provides a complex  nuanced study of such crical  issues as prejudice equaly freedom hon responsibily  the  costs of makg mal choicesBoth the maj  m characters  the  novel are not only entertag but keep the reader guessg as to their  true nature  tentions  This combed wh the very nature of  Rowlgs' magical wld offer both children  adults wh the perfect  opptuny to re-exame our assumptions about what we see what we know   what we understI only hope we don't have long to wa befe  beg able to enjoy Harry's next year at Hogwarts
JK Rowlg has done  aga bigger  better than ever befe!  I absolutely DEVOURED this stallment of the beloved Harry Potter series!  The new magical creatures were a delight to meet  the Triwizard  tournament was very well plotted  excg  This sty may be a ltle  tense f younger readers (there are several deaths) but all  all I  couldn't put  down  The only disappotment is that we'll have to wa  anohter year to fd out what happens next!
Wag  les lg blocks of cy streets Slumber parties  bookstes Children wh their noses  books rather than proped befe a  television It is truly unbelievable how the Potter series has  revolutionized readg f all agesI am generally a non fiction fan   manny genres However upon my first Potter book I was carried to a wld  of question suspense  excement Two wds: Harry Potter It is  fascatg to me how from book to book the auth has kepted me terested   Potter's journeyHarry is the friend every child longs f Wag   a long le of 100s of people to buy the book (to quickly read  over  the weekend of course) I was amazed at how children many who have never  seen one another befe fally had a common terest: readg! It was  wonderful to see everyone wldwide so excg over a fm of lerature  agaI look fward to the next edion  the Potter series when we  will aga be carried to the great unknownTake a chance wh this  series I did  I am hardly a young childPokemon step aside Harry is  here to stay! Enjoy readg everyone
In the Goblet of Fire Harry returns to Hogwarts f his fourth year  is one of the four contestants chosen to compete  the competion between the other two magic schools  Durg the last of the three challenges  Harry is transpted to a face to face competion wh the dark Ld who  discards his feeble fm  takes on a new  strong body  At the  conclusion of his fal task Harry fds himself  mtal combat wh he  who shall not be named  a battle of the ws Despe the length this  volume pulls together the events of the previous books  sets the stage  of the battle ragg between the fces of good  evil
This book was WONDERFUL!  It was better than Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter  the Scer's Stone  Harry Potter  the Chamber of secrets!  I read this book right when  was mailed to July 8th!  Anybody who reads this book will LOVE ! I know I do! I don't know anybody  hasn't fallen  love wh these books! The plot is so wty  smart!  JK Rowlg defately outdid herself this time  I'm GLAD! Everyone  should read these books!Hope you found my review helful!  I CAN'T  WAIT TILL BOOK 5!
I have read all four books  thoughly enjoyed all of them  I bought them so my son would have a chance to read them as he gets older but they capture your attention so fast  They're like a prgle once you pop you  just can't stop  I can't wa until the next one  The Goblet of Fire was  defely wth wag f
Excellent cant put the book down a must read series!
Praise JK Rowlg! I couldn't wa f this book  when I received  on 7/8 I couldn't put  down! It took me two whole days but I am fished Harry is  some of the scariest tangles of his leI laughed  I cried  I got shaky wh fear Ms Rowlg also does a great job of  puttg Harry Ron  Hermione through the obvious tough begngs of  adolescence I am curious to see where she will take some of these sty  les A fantastic spellbdg sequel to the rest  by far the most  excg yet!
Like the first three books _Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_ is well-wrten well-plotted  an stant classic  The characters  objects  this fantasy wld of JK Rowlg's creation are both  fascatg  detailed  In this fourth book young Harry Potter faces  the greatest danger yet as the evil Ld Voldemt rises to power once  aga  Harry is  danger from everythg from misfmation to betrayal  which only makes the humous parts me amusg  the drama me  suspenseful  Who will Harry go wh to the Yule Ball?  What is the Goblet  of Fire?  Who won the Wld Cup Quiddch game?  I recommend that you fd  out f yourself  the best book about Harry Potter yet
Okay this book MAY be a b on the longish side but everypage is wth ! The netire book has to do wh a suspensive build upthat could basically be a slam-bam action/suspence/thriller  the 5th book If you don't md a ltle spoil: A tournament goes wrong because someone messes wh the rules No that ltle rule breakg sets off a cha reaction I say this book is one of the best I've read  I've read a LOT of fantasy/sci-fi books Includg adult ones! Not one has captured my attention as fiercly as this one has
 was superb  i bought  yesterday  read  until this mng   was just as easy a read as the first threebut this one goes deeper to  me &quotadult&quot matters  's a tad me serious at times   there's a nice runng theme about the reliabily of the media ( lack  thereof)  regardless of the heavier themes  this book  still remas  nothg but a pure joy to read  i heartily suggest this book to anybody  who has already fallen  love wh harry potter    you  haven'tstart wh the first book!  no fair cheatg!
This was the best book of the Harry Potter series so far  I have already read the book 2 times  have started a 3rd  I hope every child  adult gets to read this wonderful book  It holds you on the edge of your seat the whole time
This novel is an excellent contuation of the Harry Potter saga  As wh the other books we fd out me about Harry as well as You-Know-Who  his mionsFrom a lerary stpot this book makes an excellent  addion  I couldn't get through the book whout referrg back tothe  perivious ooks  marvel at Ms Rowlgs consistency across booksFans  of Quiddch may be alternately pleased  disappoted wh this novel  Quiddch the sptg event which le at Hogswth seems to revolve  round makes less of an appearence  this book  We get to see the Wld  Cup game (which is over relatively quickly) but the Quiddch tournament  at Hogswth is replaced by a new event the Triwizard Tournament  The  Tournament ps the top student from each of three wizard academies (yes  Hogswth has competion) agast each other  a dangerous competion  f the hon of the schoolsAs an avid reader of mysteries I tend to  figure out the mysteries well befe the end of the book  Ms Rowlg  however constantly manages to keep me guessg (often wrongly) about who  is behd the problems Harry encounters  It is a complete pleasure to be  surprised at the end of a Harry Potter bookIf you've enjoyed the  previous books you'll love this new addion  If you haven't read the  books yet read them!  This is the best series I've read  a long time
Alright I adm   I was there  I was one of the Potterphiles  le outside Barnes  Noble when  stayed open until midnight to adm many other fans of JK Rowlg's best-sellg series  I was one of the first   le  I almost cried when I got the book I was decked out  scar   glasses  Then I took the book home to readNow Goblet of Fire is the  most fun to read aloud as I did to my younger sister ( one of my  friends whether she'll adm   not!)  I can't exactly talk right now  sce I've been swchg from the deep growlg Profess Moody to the  liltgly French Fleur Delacour  the harsh Bulgarian Vikt KrumBut  did I mention 's entirely enjoyable?Now f the book  It's hilarious!  A b mature yes but I mean stick Ron  Harry  a school dance   you've got the funniest chapter of the book  Ah those bs were  priceless  Not to mention the delightful humonce aga what's this  book rated?  )  I loved every second of   I was fallg off my  bedThere really is no pot to this review  The end of the book both  disappoted  enthused me I didn't like the whole b wh Profess  Moody  He was so COOL  Ooh but the last few chapters had me bg my  nails to the quick scarcely able to read I can't wa f the next  stallment  Wh the promise of Profess Lup (yay!)  a league  agast Voldemt whoalright I'll say no me  you're wastg time  here  haven't read the bookI didn't give this book the last star  because I didn't really connect wh the newer characters as much as I did   the last three  That isn't too say 's not FANTASTIC!  A ne out of  ten but I couldn't brg myself to tack that last ltle celestial  counterpart on there  Sry folks  I was droolg but I didn't really  fd myself hatg Crouch  likg Bagman  whatever  Karkaroff was  distant  If you haven't read the book just igne meOnly 364 days  until Book Five!  I thk I'm off to read Goblet of Fire aga!  JK  Rowlg is a goddess!y 364 days  until Book Five!  I thk I'm off to read Goblet of Fire aga!  JK  Rowlg is a goddess!
The flap of the dust-jacket of the fourth stallment of Harry Potter calls the book &quotpivotal&quot --   is  Harry Potter's latest adventure fds our hero growg up  He's discoverg girls havg nasty  arguments wh friends learng of the greater wizardg wld   becomg que powerful as well  But just as Harry is comg of age so is  the material  The previous three books have treated the presence of  Voldemt as a foil rather than a deadly enemy  Harry has had many close  calls  the past but the violence has always been offstage  often  vague  vaguely comical  But  this book Harry faces the consequences  of evil action directly Never has the devastation caused by evil been so  powerfully described  this series  any other book  It is the  hrendous consequences (lost families  friends  the emotional toll  of such loss) that are the imptant descriptions not the circumstance  When people lose parents  friends  takes one sentence to describe the  death but pages to describe the emotional  psychological damage  Based  on responses to the previous books I image that there will be a great  deal of anger  outrage expressed about the content of this book  Yet   is the unflchg examation of good  evil that gives this book   the series self the power to capture the imagation  Although terrible  events occur the auth extols the virtues of bravery tegry honesty   compassion  the face of such hr  The events themselves are  narrated whout artice n are they filtered through a mally ambiguous  viewpot  It is by directly  honestly contrastg the qualies of  heroism  villay that Ms Rowlg has managed to refce the  imptance  necessy of such qualies  Me so than any other book  this book exames the nature of right  wrong  human frailty   dems that good people actively choose to perfm good deeds  I cannot  image that there is a better lesson to be learned  a better series to  teach that lessonthat there is a better lesson to be learned  a better series to  teach that lesson
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful addion to the Harry Potter series  It is also the longest of the sties  This book brgs around the fact that even though Harry Potter is a fictional character   a wizard not everythg goes good f him  This book also ties  many  facts from the 3rd book  The describtion  the book is wonderful  Everythg is so vivid  is easy to image  The sty le is  terestg enough to hold the attention of people from all age groups
I've just fished readg _Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_  I must say  is nearly as good as the previous three Though my fave will probably always be &quotThe Scerer's Stone&quot J K Rowlg's  ever-imagative characters   supernatural events keep the pages  turng no less  number four than wh the first There are the usual  scuffles between Potter  friends  their rivals at Hogwarts as they  experience new  excg adventures  their fourth year of school  There are creepy new characters both good  dark whose motives one  never can que figure out until the end  And of course there is the  climactic struggle between good  evil present  all of the Potter  books  which Harry must fight f his le  f the contug  suppression of Ld Voldemt his arch-nemesis So thrill to the speed   excement of the Quiddch Wld Cup cheer f Harry as he triumphs  aga  aga  dangerous adventures  laugh at Rowlg's hilariously  detailed look at le at Hogwarts -- but most of all enjoy the experience  the fourth Harry Potter book  the series It's sure to be a h!
It was a wonderful idea to change how the sty went from the nmal year!  The fact that so many thgs about  were dferent from the first three  that there is an omous twist at the end allows f readers to be sure  that book V will not be a nmal outled schoolyear {like books 1-3} Also  the fact that you found out so much about the adults  this one that you  will have a new feelg about each dferent person due to their fmer  background  Wh all of this we are sure to realize that wh Voldemt  comg back the last three will be just as terestg { me} as the  first four
I wont tell everybody who reads this review what happens  the book but I can assure you YOU WILL BE IN FOR A BIG SURPRISE AT THE ENDAND WHEN YOU THINK THE SUSPENSE IS OVER IT IS NOT I rate this book 5 Stars It is  defnly the best out of all four of themI strongly suggest you der   now  you haven't already
I thk that JK Rowlg's newest book is 100% great!  It is so good because  has new challenges new adventures  you don't know what's gog to happen from one mute to the next  Durg the first task I thk   was really cool that Harry managed to call his firebolt to him  get  the golden egg  I thk that JKRowlg has a good idea on how to wre a  magnicent book because she makes the characters seem so real  She puts  the characters  posions like teasg  debts - these are all thgs   everyday le  That's what makes her sty seem like someday  could  really happen  I thk this book will spire you to dream of wlds like  Harry Potter's
I've just fished readg &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot (after dog nothg but read sce I got the book yesterday!)  I'm planng to go back  re-read  just as soon as my head clears!  JK  Rowlg has absolutely outdone herself!  This book is enmous but also  enmously readable  Paced like a thrillg rollar coaster ride the  reader is swept along through slow upward climbs  exhilaratg downward  free-falls!  The plot twists  turns leavg one breathless one moment  cheerg the next near tears at some pots smilg wh satisfaction at  the end  The length of the book gives Jo Rowlg room to exp  take  her own delicious time tellg this 4th chapter  the Harry Potter series  makg us hungry f the next stallment!  This is a wonderful read   I'm delighted to spread the wd!
In the fourth of the Harry Potter books thgs defely turn nastier Is this what adolescence is all about? If so I'm just glad my own is so far  the past that I don't remember  clearly someone must have  mercully slipped me a memy charm The book opens wh violent death   a Muggles house befe the reader gets a chance to catch up wh Harry at  the Dursleys where one is astounded to learn that Dudley has fally been  put on a diet Harry is ved to stay wh the Weasleys  attend the  Wld Quiddch Match but the play-by-play by a fmer professional player  is nothg like so fe as that of Lee Jdan's callg of the school games   professional players can use dirtier tricks than even the Slyther  teamThe plot of this volume revolves around the Triwizard Tournament: a  magic competion volvg participants from three maj wizardry schools:  Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang As usual Harry must use a combation  of bravery telligence  reliance on his friends to solve the various  puzzles set f him In this book however he also has to deal wh me  serious issues: a school dance jealous friends a nosy repter   recurrg frighteng visions I don't thk that s givg anythg away  to say that he ws through  the end though the fourth Harry Potter is  not as light-hearted as the earlier books  the reader is left hangg at  the conclusion wonderg what is gog to happen nextMs Rowlg's  usually subtle message is a ltle me deliberately spelled out  this  book than  some of her fmer books When confronted wh the Imperius  Curse (which acts like powerful hypnosis) Harry resists the structions  he is given through his own strength of will  abily to thk f  himself F me this has always been the most attractive message  the  Harry Potter books: the dividual should question what he is told   decide f himself  somethg is the right thg to do It's good to see  that Harry doesn't fget this crucial knowledge even when faced wh  beg fourteen While this volume was not actually as much fun to read as  the earlier books  still deserves &quotunputdownable&quot statuss good to see  that Harry doesn't fget this crucial knowledge even when faced wh  beg fourteen While this volume was not actually as much fun to read as  the earlier books  still deserves &quotunputdownable&quot status
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was great  It was as good as the previous three  even better  Auth JK Rowlg has an credible imagation that makes her books entertag movg  wty  I can't  wa f the next one
Rowlg has done  aga!  Harry Potter's adventures keep this 20-year old turng the pages wh anticipation  Can't wa f the next stallment!
This was one of te best books I have ever read  Although 700+ pages may sound like a lot  really isn't once you get started  This book cludes many tounaments  games  new spells  new people  Plus as always a  new dark arts teacher  many new creatures  I would say that  is  defatly wth gettg  hardcover  especially  paperback  It is  wth the money
Absolutely loved Harry Potter &amp the Goblet of Fire!  I got  on Saturday at lunchtime &amp fished  by Saturday eveng  Couldn't put  down!  Amazg sty!  I am now readg to my daughters - some parts  scary f younger kids but there is plenty of laughter to lighten  up  Way to go Ms Rowlg!
I loved ! If you do not belive I read this book  just 2 days well belive  I may only be terg 6'th grade but I can read at a 8'th grade level Well the book was great  I now cant wa until the 5'th book  comes out I was very surprised at the end wh Voldemt  all but I  will not surprise you wh the endg because you might not have read   yet But  your a Harry Potter fan I highly suggest you read this!
Once me JK Rowlg has pulled us to her fascatg wld of wizardry The hype leadg up to the release of this fourth stallment ensured a high hurdle of expectations to clear f Rowlg Not only does  she clear  but she soars above  on a Firebolt 2000This book is  filled wh all the delightful anecdotes of Hogwarts le  characters  that we've come to expect Me dangerous creatures useful spells   perilous potions abound as our friends move through their fourth year This  year is highlighted by the Tri-Wizard Tournament - a tournament between  rival wizardg schools that is beg held f the first time  over a  hundred years followg s cancellation due to a growg death tollThe  plot is liberally sprkled wh hts of a second comg f You-Know-Who  which combed wh top-notch tournament action  the gliously  detailed Hogwarts settg makes f a  hold-your-breath-till-the-end--you-can styWhat will happen to  Harry  his friends? You'll have to read  f yourself but I promise  you you won't be disappoted
Magnicent movg touchg rivetg!  Wonderful  I especially enjoyed the ltle touches of romance--our boys  girls are growg up  discoverg the &quotcharms&quot of the oppose sex!
WOW!  What an amazg book!Unlike the first three books  the series which were almost self-contaed sties &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is truly a jumpg off pot f the rest of the  series It ties up many loose ends from the first three books troduces  many new characters to the series  thrusts Harry  friends to a  wld of magic far greater than what they'd seen  the first three This  book delves me to the polics of their wld as well as many of the  other creatures we've met Sty wise the first four books combed read  almost like a prologue to a much grer tale- a tale I can't wa to read
In a wld where dem is manufactured wh advertisg  public relations 's reassurg to fd that some thgs deserve their populary The Harry Potter books are purely  simply greatHarry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire has all of the elements that made books 1 - 3  so fantastically enjoyable but 's even better than the first three The  laughs are louder the scary parts are much scarier  we learn me  about the people we like ( the ones we like to hate)Is  too soon  to pre-der book 5?
Faly s come Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire And wh  comes a whole new adventure wh me laughs  fun then ever No doubt about  this book matches the ws  the fun as the last three This book takes  Harry back to Hogwarts school f wichcraft  wizardry f the fth  year There he meets up wh his two best friends Ron  Hermione   meets his old enemy Lucius MalfoyHe is also troduced to his old teachers   meets new friends I dont want to give away any of the many surprises  that are  this book but the endg is action packed  filled wh  excment So please do me a fav  do yourself a fav  get this  book  is just as good as the last three  not even betterIt is wrten  beautuly  you will enjoy  from begg till end I have already  been cast to the magic spell wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I  hope you will too
JK Rowlg has done  once aga  This book is well wth the wa  very much up to the pre-release hype!The book begs much dferently that those  the past-- is very obvious that Ld Voldemt has  returned!  The chapter leaves us wonderg just what could possibly happen  next  then we are sent right back to the previous books wh another  glimpse of le wh the confes of Privet Drive  However we are  quickly submerged  the wonderful lives of the lovable Weasley family   entralled wh the latest ventions of Fred  Gege  Harry comes face  to face wh Charlie  the very COOL Bill Weasley  the suspense begs  at the Quiddich Wld Cup!  We even see Harry  Ron's friendship tested   we are left wh a very posive feelg that Ron has serious feelgs  regardg Hermione!  Harry has a huge crush on you guessed  Cho Chang   we fd that Snape may not be as evil as we always believed!  We also  learn that Lucius Malfoy is exactly as we have always believed him to be!  Harry is  contact wh his Godfather Sirius Black  we fd out why  Harry must endure the Dursleys every summer rather than spendg them wh  those that love him  We also fd out why Ld Voldemt's curse did not  wk on Harry!  There is one great sadness a character does  fact  die! Even so I advise all to beg this book  never put  down until  the last page is fished!  I know that's what I did!  Enjoy!
Ms Rowlg is to be commended on another great adventure  She has certaly joed the ranks of Milne Lewis Whe  Tolkien  her creation of a secondary fantasy wldWhat's me she makes these 700  pages simply fly by as Harry undergoes further obstacles   surprisesAs a teacher I'd love to have my students read this one wh  me but I have a feelg that they will have completed  when I return   SeptemberAnd f those who wonder  Harry Potter is solid lerature  the answer is of course yes  All one needs to do is read a paragraph   two from any of her books to see that Rowlg is a wonderful styteller   a fe stylistHer wrg is raisg the comprehension sces of  students throughout America  In fact  schools spent me time wh  Rowlg than wh preppg f Stardized Readg Tests the  &quotreadg crisis&quot  America would be solvedBravo Ms  Rowlg  I can't wa to read Book V
A chapter a night at bedtime was too slow f me so I had to plow through the entire book over the weekend  Ms Rowlg has not only done  aga by presentg our fave characters from the first three books she has  added real thrills  excement  As Harry grows older ( presumably  his fans) he encounters even me dangerous  mysterious foes  I don't  want to give away a sgle plot pot ( the plot is thick  volume  four) but be prepared f a really scary endg that has me already  anticipatg Harry's fth year
The 4th Harry Potter book is defately the best one This book keeps you guessg right to the end A must f all Harry Potter fans
I have just fished HP IV  I am very disappoted  Many people have cricized the Harry Potter books because of their emphasis on magic  This latest stallment however will draw the ire  wrath of many  parents as  is chock full of the most violent imagery imagable  The  book begs wh a Quiddch Wld Cup after which a family of  &quotMuggles&quot (read: people) are all but gang-raped by vicious  wizards bearg hoods  In addion Hermione's crusade to free the elfs is  practically a manesto ghost-wrten by Mart Luther Kg!  (Indeed  the behavi of the elf Wky is so like the stereotypical negro slave of  the old South  put Jar Jar Bks to shame! ) At Hogwarts the bully  Malfoy is subjected to violent cpal punishment by a profess- wh no  official reprim from Dumblede! You will have to read  this book yourself to believe what I am sayg - I AM NOT MAKING THIS  UP!  F those of you who cannot fd the time to read get the  UNABRIDGED audio cassette version
The Harry Potter Series keeps gettg better  better- I can't wa until the 7th one (to see how good  is) lol :-0
I started readg the Harry Potter series after my ne year old son who read the three book series five times said he was &quotsimply addicted&quot  I soon too became addicted to these books  &quotGoblet  of Fire&quot has just fueled the addiction!  This book is superb!  I read  the book straight through f ten hours  did not want  to end  The  plot twists  character development are phenomenal!  You will cry as  you reflect upon the herent goodness  Harry  his friends as they  battle evil  Rowlg's images are rich  powerful  quickly draw the  reader to an absolutely stunng wld  Buy this book  then share   wh the children you love--you will give them an unfgettable gt!  If  you can buy addional copies  donate them to a deservg school  library  children's leracy program--there is no better way to encourage  a love of readg!  Now I ask can we survive wag 365 f Book Five?  :)
All Harry lovers please don't kill me In fact I'm a fanatic myself It's just that  seems like 's not a children's book anyme I was expectg somethg me like the first 3 books You now HAPPY! JK  Rowlg is still an amazg wrer but book 4 is a transional novel  It's open ended (I hate those) but still I'm wag f the 5th one  When is is comg out? :)
Rowlg does  aga wh this fourth stallment  this series  She sps a tale as no one can  And once you start get hooked there's no puttg  down  And the joy of holdg a hefty 636 pages (Canadian  version)! Absolutely wth the wa She deserves nothg less than 5  stars!  Buy  read  share  wh young  old alike  They'll all  thank you f !
JK Rowlg has not run out of entertag sties! This fourth Harry Potter book is absolutely wonderful just like the precedg three It's longer  scarier which only prolongs the excement I recommend this  book completely!
How can I describe JK Rowlg's latest wk? As you see I have tled my review of the book as a thrillg experience which is exactly what I found Harry Potter  the Gobl of Fire to be The auth wres wh much detail  describes Harry's wld expertly Her wds captivate you    seems as  you are wh Harry  his friends durg their adventures  I would not like to ru any of the sty  plot f those of you who  have not yet read the book  fished I was also surprised by the twists of the sty  In sht Harry  Potter  the Gobl of Fire was a highly entertag book All readers  will thoughly enjoy  I am sure this book will be conttued to be  read f a long time comg This reviewer cannot wa f the next book   the series
This wonderful book is a contuation of the engrossg saga ofHarry Potter  his friends  is truely f people of all agesThere are some suations  this book which can encourage discussions between parent  child (f example the death of one of the characters)As wh the other Harry Potter books this book shows you that there are many ways to solve problems  Above all  you are true to yourself  your friends you will make the right decisions  le  The adventure  magic  this book are equal to the stards J K Rowlg set  the previous volumes  I thk  will be enjoyed equally by ages 9 to 112
We've been wag anxiously f this tle to be releasedwell wth the wa  I'm also pleased to rept that the material is still appropriate f my 9 &amp 14 year old daughtersIts caused que a  stir at our house  My two daughters my we  I took turns readg a  few chapters at a time so no one felt cheated  The first chapter just  reaches out  grabs you  At one pot  seems that Harry Potter is  gog to play a non-central role because of the triwizard tournament but he  immediately gets thrust to the limelight due to an unexpected turn of  events  Snape  others are up to there usual nasty selves though the  new Defender of the Dark Arts teacher help balance out their unjust  behavi along the way  Also Voldermolt is back  you get treated to  me histy of Harry Potters encounter at age one  Enjoy!  One note: I  highly recommend you read the 3 previous volumes first to fully underst   appreciate this 4th ( best) lerary stallment
Were there really over 700 pages?  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot firebolted by until the last 100 pageswhen I kept needg to pause because my teeth were grdg  chatterg eyes burng wh tears of disbelief  I couldn't stop yellg advice to Harry  gapg   amazement  hr as Rowlg slowly exquisely unveiled layer after  layer (after layer!) of plot surprises  Rowlg has such a gt f makg  you feel like you're a part of the action a friend of Harry's--which I  guess is why I miss him &amp Hogwarts so much between book releases  &quotThe Goblet&quot is a great suspenseful read--the most grippg of  the series to date-- filled wh all the tricate details that made the  others so magical  You'll wish  was double the length
This is about Harry  his furth year at Hogwarts where helearns to be a wizardIn this book the maj thgs happen as such as the Quiddch is cancelledThe reader will shiver at the endg Miss Rowlg has magiced upThe wst part of this book is the first few chaptersThey were so dull to me
I have just gotten the book 2 days ago  im on chapter 12 as of today ( July102000)  's really great I've never read a book this excg 's filled wh fictionactionmystery  other thgs I recommend  Harry Potter IV To every one!
Havg bought the 4th book of the Harry Potter series on Saturday mng July 8 my 9-year-old boy  I vied f the readg of   While we shared readg aloud some chapters  traded  off I got to read   after he fell asleep  fished  at 3:45  the mngThe Goblet  of Fire is a combation of the tensy  themes of Books 1  3 I  thought wh a goodly amount of Voldemt Azkaban  the Mistry of  Magic as well as a peek to the wider wizardry wld of Rowlg's than  just the UK (though all from Euro-Asia)  Themes of Harry's friendship wh  Hermione Ron  the rest of the Weasleys were developed as well as the  early teenage stirrgs of the Fourth Year class (girls me so than the  boys naturally)  And Harry's heroism darg  good character are  contually confirmedThere are some Mission Impossible-like plot twists  near the end but  all hangs together very well  It was terestg  too to compare the actual plot elements wh the many rums -- the ma  characters fallg  love wh other people the death of a ma  character etc etc  Although attractions to the oppose sex were there  Rowlg sensibly kept those subplots on the back burner f these mostly  14-year-old characters  I won't spoil the surprise of who dies f there  are some close calls  the book  the darker feel of this book is  apparent from the first chapter where a man diesIn toto  you  liked the first three you HAVE to read the fourth  It does not  dissappot!
I have never read anythg so good! This bbok is magical really! I believe that this one really is the best of the series of four I may be 18 but not too old to enjoy this fe novel We are troduced to new charecters new plots new twists  a death Wow I've never read a book  so fast  my le I couldn't put this one down! I'm not gog to say much  me because I'd rather not let the plot go but trust me this novel is  one of the best I have read  many years  I have read a lot of books!  Five out of Five
I am 9 years old  fished the book  two days (I would have read  all night but mom wouldn't let me!)  It was great!  You didn't know what would happen next  It had a lot of thgs hooked to the other book which I really liked  I would like a ltle me of Sirius Black  the next book  Can't wa f the next one!
Of course I stayed up until 1 am last night to fish this book Plus I had to get 2 copies so my 10 year old son Max could read his own copy while I read me  This has been wth wag f you will fd that  gets  me  me terestg as the chapters unfold Harry is defetly  maturg  the themes are a b me grown up Which is to be expected of  a fourth year student Relations deepen  also touch on themes mentioned   book three I will not say anythg about the many adventures Harry   his friends fd themselves  except to say there are certaly twists   turns that are not expected This is as much an adventure sty as a  mystery book It is me graphic  I will have Max wre his view pot  when he fishes his book Now I have to wa another year until book 5 If  only JK Rowlg could wre as quickly as a certa newspaper wrer -  Ra Skeeter of the Daily Prophet
When I first saw the book I was  awe of how big  was Longer than any of the books so far I sat down was was once aga pulled to Harry's wld While darker than her other books  still was very much enjoyable  The mixg of fantasy  realiy is refreshg to see  children books  today And the fact that the parent can enjoy the book as well as  maybe  even me than the child is very special deed I would recondmend that  anyone trested  fantasy to read this book as well as the rest of the  series
this was the best i won't tell you what happens but: Harry wakes up at 4 Privet Drive durg summer vacation where he lives wh his Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon  spoiled pig-like cous Dudley It was the same year  after year the Dursleys pretended that Harry didn't exist  defely  disapproved of any weird thgs like the vivid dream he had the night  befe He wakes up to fd his scar poundg on his fehead  he knows  somethg is up But this vacation turned f the better when he receives a  letter from the Weasleys They ve him to spend the rest of the summer  wh them  to go see the Quiddch Wld Cup which was held  Bra  So Harry travels by fire to the Burrow  his dark  threateng  adventure begs He has to ask a girl to the Yule ball  other fun  thgs happen  this book This is a great book  was my fave
Dested to become a true classic  Wty engagg  imagative the Harry Potter series only gets better wh each new stallment  We now start to glimpse the gr scheme of the entire series  Book Four as Ld  Voldemt regas his power  his followers --  only Harry Dumblede   the gang at Hogwarts can stop him  Some really wonderful character  development  this new book  some surprisg revelations especially  wh regards to the Weasleys Ron Hermione  po Neville Longbottom  (can't wa to see what happens to him!) The auth has done a superb job   settg up what's to come  the next three books  crelatg   wh what's happened  the previous three books  I can't image a better  series to troduce children to the thrills of readg!
Though  was somewhat darker  tone than the previous three I loved The Goblet of Fire!  It seems to me that Rowlg is constantly heatg up the battle between good  evil  book four really gets the fire gog  Though  was darker heavier  me tense I thought  f really  well to the series  And while Rowlg denies tryg to teach any mal  lessons to children I don't thk Dumblede can resist  Whether  not  Rowlg tends you can't read this book whout feelg like you have  learned somethg  Some of the heavier issues Rowlg tackles  this book  show that Harry has real strength of character  He is brave selfless  fair honable  is willg to do what is right rather than what is  merely easy  So while Rowlg may not necessarily be tryg to  &quotteach&quot these lessons I thk Harry Potter is an excellent role  model f my children
This trigug sequel was a book that I couldn't put down sce I laid hs on  Harry's adventures keep growg to new heights  the book takes on an unexpected twist  As many of you have heard somebody does die  this book  Harry does have a growg terest  girls  Though   was tricky to follow  the end  is still my fave book
I was really concerned that the new Harry Potter book couldn't possibly live up to s hype I'm a children's librarian  I'd been takg reserves from exced children f this book f months  Happily I was  not disappotedI don't want to spoil the sty f anybody so I'll  just say a few wds f any parents who are concerned about the  suabily of the new book f their young children  First while the  book is deed scary I would not say that  is substantially me  frighteng than &quotChamber of Secrets&quot  Second a character does  die yes but Rowlg hles the death  que a tasteful manner that  should cause no nightmares  Third there is a ty sprklg of profany   the book which was not present  the previous books  The oaths were  mild though  can be glossed over by those parents sensive to such  thgsThree me books are comg  Rowlg has set thgs  motion  f a great climax  the future books  I urge anyone who has hesated to  beg the series befe now to dive to the first book you won't regret  !
Lovely lovely lovely! This book allthough 700+ pages is defatly wth ! I dered wh Amazon got  Saturday mng  fished  Sunday! I was amazed!  The new characters are well wrten (Mad-Eye Moody   many from the Mistry) Rowlg put amazg contuty  this book A page  turner wh many many pages to turn  keeps you jumpg All though much  darker than the 1st 3 books defatly one to read!
I got the book on Saturday  fished  Sunday night  In spe of the length  was still a quick read  I defely enjoyed  but  was much darker  tone than the previous three  I also missed the regular  Quiddch games as they were que entertag  a fun break from the  trigue The Triwizard Cup was terestg but not que as fun as  Quiddch sce  was fairly clear who was gog to w the  ChallengeThere were a lot me characters  this book  not all of  them were well developed  Too many misters  &quotoutsiders&quot  (Maxime Karkoff) who we never really got to know  I also kd of missed  the Dursleys who only really appear  cameo at the start  She does a  great job wh the usual gang   was nice to meet the older Weasley  boys  Hopefully they will appear aga as they seem to have great  promise  are much me terestg than PercyThe evil  this book  seems me real  less fantasy than the previous books  the kids  are defely growg up  Hmones kick !  The climax is que rivetg   very emotional - filled wh fear sadness  btersweet momentsI  thoughly enjoyed   consider  a great contuation of the series  She ends  wh a b of a clfhanger so we're  f another really  long wa!
JK Rowlg has made me anxious f her next novel on Harry Potter!  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot creates suspense fear  even sadness to the reader  Although this novel is longer than the others  there is not a dull moment  I could not put the book down  In the end   made me wonder what was gog to happen  the next book  &quotHarry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot leaves the reader  suspense at the  end  What is Ld Vo- oh what's his name- gog to do next?  That is what  I  all Harry Potter readers want to know I highly recommend this book  It is a gothic romance  suspense novel all combed  one!
I read this  2 days This book is alive on so many dferent levels I can image this seriese becommg a classic like Alice  Wonderl
As  the first 3 books weren't good enough Rowlg does one better wh &quotGoblet Of Fire&quot Harry is a typical boy wh wh typical (sta) problems If you read the series then you MUST read this one If  you don't already read the series then you must start so you can get to  &quotGoblet Of Fire&quot truly Rowlg's BEST wk yet!
The book was a fe stallment of the Potter series but I found that  was nowhere near the consistently high level of the first three  Although I am pleased to say that I hated Draco Malfoy  Uncle Vernon as much as  ever they have remaed the same characters wh the same functions   quirks as  other Potter books  One might expect even the lowly Draco to  develop somewhat over the 1600 pages that thus far constute the series  The auth does remarkably however  the development of the young  protagonists  the sty - tacklg now me of the adolescent angst   trials faced by nmal non-wizardg teens  Every now  then I paused  from my readg to gather my thoughts  recall that this is no longer an  11-year-old Harry!After the first two-thirds of the volume I was a  ltle wary of fishg  at least wh the zeal  anticipation wh  which I had greeted the begng  However last 200 pages of the book are  Potter sty tellg at s best but this qualy was somehow both  enhanced  disturbed by the slow exposion  developmentDespe  this I do love Ms Rawlgs' abily to keep me teased  surprised by  the eventual outcome of all of her sties  She has the abily to drop a  bomb on the reader wh frightengly few pages left  the book yet still  quickly  efficiently defend  even render completely sensible this  moveI will read this aga  ALL 734 pages!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is an tense book It captures the essence of fantasy action sci-fi  mystery all  one BIG (752 pgs) book Harry Ron  Hermione go on many adventures  some new people  show up  the book I recommend this book f all ages  I'm not gog  to give away any secrets of  because you should enjoy the book f  yourself!
Harry wakes up at 4 Privet Drive durg summer vacation where he lives wh his Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon  spoiled pig-like cous Dudley  It was the same year after year the Dursleys pretended that Harry didn't  exist  defely disapproved of any weird thgs like the vivid dream  he had the night befe He wakes up to fd his scar poundg on his  fehead  he knows somethg is up But this vacation turned f the  better when he receives a letter from the Weasleys They ve him to  spend the rest of the summer wh them  to go see the Quiddch Wld  Cup which was held  Bra So Harry travels by fire to the Burrow   his dark  threateng adventure begs He has to ask a girl to the Yule  ball  other fun thgs happen  this book This is a great book  was  my fave
The Harry Potter series is the only series I've read childrens  adult where Book One was great Book Two was better Book Three was better than that  Book Four better still! This is a slightly me mature Harry Potter book  Harry &amp Ron start noticg girl ( Hermione notices  boys) there's me Dark Arts  the endg may be too tense f very  young readers  (And yes someone dies) The book is really two sties:  The Wld Cup Quiddich Match (durg the summer)  Hogwarts Year Four  The book is long (752 pages) but never slows down  -- And wa until you  read the endg I was one of hundreds at my local bookste who stood   le at midnight to buy this book  I'll happily wa  le when Book 5  comes out
After readg the first three books of the recent hs  chart-toppg Harry Potter seriesI am half way done this book at  just as good as the first three  I can't wa to read the rest
This book is very long  good It is better than any other book I've read I recomend this book f ages 9  up
LIKE A FUNNY FICTION FOR TEENAGER
All I can say is this book was defetly wth wag f  Sce I got  yesterday I haven't been able to put  down  now that I am fished I don't know how I will wa f the next stallment!  The  action mystery  magic of this book is what makes  so good!  If you  don't already own this book make sure you get !
Once aga Rowlg had my eyes waterg halfway through the book my heart poundg by the time I reached page 500  a headache from the tensy of the book by the time I was done  It was emotionally drag!  Although Harry defely gets a b older  this sty (there is a b  of teen-talk a few &quotm&quot swears etc) I would ( I am a  children's librarian) still recommend the book f children  I know that  some people were concerned about  beg too scary  old but Rowlg  hles the adjustment well  Enjoy!
I like the Harry Potter series  I have enjoyed readg all of them  I thk &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is an excellent addion to the series  This is not children's lerature on the level of &quotAlice   Wonderl&quot but then what modern child could possibly read   underst this now-classic today?  The nice thg about Harry Potter books  is that they are full of excellent  amusg details: the quirks of the  professs at Hogwarts the array of sweets that explode  surprise the  range of good  evil  the charactersall of whom are better defed  than Harry himself  The fight between good  evil (evil may come close  but we are comfted  knowg that good will eventually prevail) is  excg  helps to move the action along  between discursive bs on  classwk  Potions  the Histy of Magic but the books this one  especially lack a hero  Harry Potter is me a collection of facts (scar  parents' deaths awful family green eyes etc) than a real person who put  to the test  tried triumphs f reasons of character  Harry isn't a  hero he isn't even as terestg as most of the other young wizards he  knows  certaly not as terestg as the grown-ups  &quotThe Goblet  of Fire&quot has a REAL hero however: Cedric Diggy  He seems to embody  all the admirable tras that Harry is creded wh  I look fward to  the next stallment of this series  I also look fward to the  characters' growth as they grow older  as the plot thickens (as   certaly has)  they rise to meet the challenges of good  evil  everyday  extra-dary
This book the 4th of a seven book series about the adventures of a young wizard named Harry Potter  This book just like the other three books is excellent as ever  This book keeps you guessg  makg  impossible  to put down  The only thg about the style I will reveal that Harry  will be chosen f competg  the Triwizard Tournament the tournament  set between several wizards  wches from around the wld to see who is  the best  Harry competes   even though he did not enter his name  This leads to questiong on how he was entered  The tournament can be  dangerous so could someone be tryg to kill Harry Potter  If you want to  fd out read the book If you have not ever read any of the Harry Potter  books I recommend readg them startg wh Harry Potter  the  Scerer's Stone
This is defetley an achievement f anyone under the age of 12 to read  It's twice the size of the other books  Heres some clues to what happens: Harry is submted to the Triwizard contest where three wizards from  dferent schools compete agast each other  He was submted under the  age lim by someone unknown  Because he was listed under a dferent  school he was picked as a champion  This makes two Hogwarts champions   The other is the Hufflepuff seeker Cedric Diggy  The new  defense-agast-the-dark-arts teacher is Mad Eye Moody an aur f the  Mistry of magic I won't tell you who gets killed-that would ru the  whole book  But I will tell you this- 's a student  he wasn't a ma  character Harry dosen't really get a girlfriend though he does have a huge  crush on Cho Chang the ravenclaw seeker  There's also no quiddch played   this book so we don't fd out who the new capta is until the next  book  Sirius is back  so is Pettigrew (Wmtail)  Percy's back now  wkg f the Mistry  you fally get to meet Bill  Charlie the  oldest Weasley brothers  Harry also gets to go to see the Wld Quiddch  Cup wh the Weasley family  Read this book If you loved the others  It's  great  Voldemt also rises aga  I f one can't wa to fd out  what happens  the next 3 books  That will be awhile though
I don't know where to beg This book is great I will not reveal too much about the book because  is too good to spoil  f everyone It starts out dferently than the other books begg  the village   which the evil wizard Ld Voldemt's father grew lived  Voldemt is  havg a conference wh his despicable servant Wmtail (AKA Peter  Pettigrew) The muggle gardener of the house mysteriously vanishes on the  same night they were havg this meetg  Meanwhile a few hundred miles  away Harry Potter scar begs to hurt which is one of the strange events  leadg up to a BIG turng pot  the series Harry is ved to the  Quiddch wld cup where a terryg event happens which seems to  confirm that somethg is gog to happen  There is no quiddch (dang  !) except f the begng but there is another contest between three  schools The book goes on about how a mysterious fourth contestant is  picked by an impartial judge  Harry's up  down year at Hogwarts The  book fishes off wh a twist  a bang but I will reveal no me  I lerally lovedthis book! It combes action suspense friendship  trouble by the mischevious Fred  Gege Weasly who we all like so much   maybe even a ltle romance JK Rowlg  my opion has outdone  herself this time  I really wish  won't take so long f the next  book to come out! (The event  this book is SOO big that i cannot wa f  the next one)  If your a fan this is a must read   you haven't  picked up this series yet DO!
The children from our readg club are simply delighted wh this book --  all preceedg tles  I'm grateful to Ms Rowlg f creatg Harry Potter  providg such a wonderful role model where a child could  emulate Harry's self-discovery while enjoyg such captivatg adventures!  I enthusiastically recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE Thank  you Ms Rowlg!
This fantasy struck me wh aw f I could not help but to read  from the moment i got  till I had fished  The suspence was so high i had read over 600 pages by that afternoon  clearly said to all who have read    probobly will  the future that the auth has a very enchantg  talent  wrg books f i cannot wa until 5th harry potter book  comes this book is a must f all who likes fantasy books
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  The Goblet of Fire had me spellbound I couldn't put  down until I had fished readg every page  I was laughg so had that my sides hurt wh Fred  Gege's ventions  scared to turn out the lights because of &quotYou-Know-Who&quots  reeappearance  cryg my heart out along wh Harry as he mourns  Who  needs a rollercoaster ride when Harry Potter is here?
I've read all of the Harry Potter books  this one is by farmy fave! The book which is a long 734 pages was devoured by me a 1  1/2 day period that enjoyed very much Most series of books I tire of after readg about two books from but I don't thk that I'll ever tire of readg the Harry Potter adventures I can't wa to reach the end yet I fd  very sad when I do I hate to realize that I will have to wa through months to get my hs on the next one I own each book  the hardcover edion  have read each of the first three numerous times I thk that every body should read them even though I would like to thk that I like them the most
We spent the weekend readg It is fantastic  Dont read a wd about the book befe you read  It is every b as fantastic as the first three   will renew your harrymania we are already wag f the next  book
This book was really great The characters were fantasticlywrten the plot kept me on the edge of my seat through the wholebook I couldn't put  down I would defetly recomend  to any one young  old  Why can't they make me stars f Harry Potter? That would solve quiet a few problems =)  I hope that who ever reads Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire enjoys  as much as i did
Sayg i at all disliked the book would be a complete lie (It was one of the best books i have read  i fished   2 days) but there were  some thgs that dissapoted meBut first i will expla why I liked  the book so much Its most proment feature is how imagative  is  There is hardly one thg  the book that is hard to visualize this would  not be such a proment feature except f the amount of made up magical  thgs  the book everythg is described beautully Also the ma  charachters are all que likeable  you want to fd out what happens  to them makg  a real page turner And lastly the adventures they go  on are always unexpected  the book is very excgWh all that  said  seems there would be very ltle one could fd that was negative  about this book  this is true but there are still a few thgs i  disliked all of them havg to do wh the charachter development  Probably because this book was wrten f young children no-one  the  book truely seemed freighteng  i thought that the evil charachters  didn't seem que evil enough The only other problem wh the book (  the far greater one  my md) is that there was a que unnexpected  change  a charachter at the end of the book  nothg that happened  through the rest of the book seemed to lead up to   was just st of  thrown at you which was slightly annoygThese two bad pots  however barely detract from how wonderfull the book is  I strongly  urge anyone who dosn't already have a copy to get one!
the book is full of fun mystery  adventure I would recommed this book  the other three to people of all ages It was so exg I could hardly put  down Even  you have a ltle kid you could read aloud some  of the book every night I'm sure both of you would  enjoy  JKRowlg  has to be one of the most talented auths  the wld I can't wa till  the next book comes out
JK Rowlg once aga brgs freshness  hum to the Harry Potter series  Book No 4 is a gem  to my md even better than the Chamber of Secrets  the Prisoner of Azkeban  The sty is beautully plotted uses all kds of new magical devices (while fdg new angles to old  ones)  troduces a slew of wonderfully developed  clever characters  that one hopes will keep croppg up  later books The 734 pages are  anythg but dauntg I could have read twice as much  still not have  gotten enough  I don't want to give any of the plot away so suffice  to  say don't miss this one!
This was a great book I just loved !  I am not particular to adventure scary books but I just loved this one! I read   2 days But I won't tell you any me!  I don't want to ru all of the surprises   !
It's only been out two days so I don't want to spoil any surprises but you shouldn't be onle - you should be readg Harry Potter's Fourth Adventure  Once aga JK Rowlg does a wonderful job of transptg you to the Hogwarts school  This book had some much needed teraction  outside of Hogwarts as well  You can only fd secrets  a school like  that f so long!  Anyway get your copy  read up -  you liked the  others you'll love this one too
Haven't fished the book yet but  looks good so far My only fear wh the Harry Potter series is that is turns to a fmula: Voldemt rises aga from his defeat  the last book makes attempts on Harry's le but  is defeated aga  a climactic battle at the end Hopefully Rowlg will  fd some way carryg the plot all the way to the seventh book whout  repeatg the same sty le Just a m thg though Overall I'm very  happy wh the book  wh the series as a whole
The long-awaed sequel  the Harry Pter series blurbed like crazy f the last few months Has  been wth the wa? Well yes  noYes because all Harry Pter fans will read this book no matter s qualy  It's grippg enough  the trique  Hogwarts atmospherics are still  sufficient to susta terestBut this book isn't as good as Books 2   3 Rowlg's gettg fmulaic  her plottg Voldemt aided by a  servant grows stronger (As he has  books 1 to 3) Foes are out to harm  Pter - but mysterious agents help him survive Hermione acts secretive  aga There's the obligaty lengthy Quiddch descriptions  the fm of  a wld-cup a la Euro 2000 And Pter has a one-on-one encounter wh  Voldemt -  yes survives aga YawnThe wrg's not as taut as  the previous books Superfluous descriptions ramble on wrten obviously  wh an eye f the camera Me efft is spent at scene-settg than  narrative especially  the first one-third of this (734-page) tome  Pter's fledglg adolescence  teen fatuation is hled somewhat  clumsily Some chapters read like somethg from Sweet Valley High  gigglg school girls stakg out popular boys  all Oh  there's the  obligaty nod to polical crectness  the fm of a me racially  mixed character castThis book frankly reads like a book   transion Maybe 14 is a clumsy year f Pter Maybe Rowlg caved  to  her publisher's suggestions f polical crectness a teen romance   a wld tournamentI just hope Pter  Rowlg grow up me  Book  5  have the courage to go back to what they do best: sp a rippg good  yarn about good  evil (hog)warts  all Get the basic sty structure  right leave the scene settg to the movie producers This book will still  be a sensation - but largely because  brows on the fame of the first 3  By self 's flawed I hope Book 5 next summer won't disappotn't disappot
This book is the best out of all four books  my opionIt's full of  suspense  mysteryThe endg has an unexpected twist  leaves you wonderg what happens nextBUY IT!
True to the previous Harry Potter novels Goblet of Fire is fast paced fun While darker  tone  is as good as Prisoner of Azkaban which  my opion was the best  the series Rowlg brgs many new details to  the sty which keep  fresh stead of rehased as so many serials become  One drawback is the legnth Many children will fd  dauntg but  is  wth the efft
This Harry Potter book topped all others because of the length  I felt the sties were not rushed such as what occured  the Quiddch Wld Cup
This book is wonderful Its defely wth the money I thought my dad wasn't gog to get  f me because I was bed wh the first three as I've already read them 11 times each I liked the excement  the idea  that Quiddch matches were cancelled  that a special event would take  place stead This is a big book full of secrets  mysteries  I read  the whole book  one day Not too shabby f an 11 year old kid!

&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is fally here!  This latest stallment contas the same excement hum danger  wonderfully ventive imagation as the precedg Harry Potter books   Harry Potter fans will not be disappoted  JK Rowg has managed to  once aga entrance us  a wonderful adventure  Parents of younger  readers should be warned:  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  is darker  scarier than any of the other books  I would advise parents  to at least skim some of the later chapters befe allowg their children  to read them  I personally feel that none of this is too dark   frighteng f young readers The themes of hon friendship  bravery  are still idolized  However parents should be aware of the darker  contents of this book  It is hard f readers not to be disappoted   later books  series  Many series seem to loose their magic as they go  along  Readers have high expectations that books often do not live up to   &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is as exhilaratg   wonderful as any of the earlier books  F me the only disappotment is  havg to wa another year to read Harry's further adventures
Harry Potter #4 is an amazg book! Like the others  has all the antics of Harry Herome  Ron Not to mention new sister characters The  plot grabs ahold of the reader  doesn't let go! You won't want to stop  readg  once you pick  up! Would recommend to anyone! Young  old!  Great f all ages
What can I say?  The Harry Potter books just keep gettg better  better  The series which began wh only a 250 page book has gradually produced longer  longer sequels which culmate  the 751 page of Book  4  The Goblet of Fire was an amazg book which contues the plot  threads left behd  Book 3  Although a lot of people have seen f to  view the Harry Potter books  a rather negative light I can assure you  that there is nothg negative wh these books  Instead the sties  open up an entirely new  wholly imagative wld to the young ( old)  md  Do not make the assumption that these books are only f children  They are not  Harry Potter is a series f all ages  Whether you are  young  old you shall enjoy the books f their imagative plots   wonderfully endearg characters  Indeed I'm sure that I echo the  sentiments of Harry Potter fans everywhere when I say that I can't wa f  Book 5 to arrive  pick up the sty that Bookd 1-4 began
I am an adult who loves the Harry Potter series  It is well wrten  the sty is appropriate f all ages Goblet of Fire is the best one yet Harry is growg up  the book reflects the confusg time of adolescence  while still enterg us to the special wld of Hogwarts
Once aga Rowlg has wrten a book that I just had to read all at once Rowlg develops her characters  her plot que well wh enough fmation f one to have a clear picture of the characters  scenes  The plot of &quotGoblet of Fire&quot moves along quickly but not at such  a speed as to lose the reader The way Rowlg wres one's imagation  comes to play   my case the reader can become immersed  the  book becomg one of the characters The teractions between Harry his  friends faculty  others he meets are conceived wh skill Because  Harry acts his age he is real In fact all the characters  the book  have great depth   is up to the reader to decide until the end whom  Harry can trust Ftunately there is a lim on the length of reviews: I  could go on endlessly about the wonders of this book  the previous  tles
Harry Potter IV is wth 's weight  gold! This book is better than the first three It fully lives up to all the hype  expectations that have surrounded ! This sty was so rivettg that even after 720 pages I  still wanted me Way to go Joanne! I can't wa f the next stallment
This book is the best book out of the four Harry Potter booksJoanne Rowlg plots are really wth trygHer imagation is really great Hogwarts has enter my dreams every night sce I read the bookHarry  Potter Books are really wth buyg
I couldn't put  down  From begng to end the plot twists that JK Rowlg images are amazg  Harry's adventures get me  me elabate  me  me dangerous  The longest book yet  still not  long enough to keep the reader from longg f the next  The quiddch  tournament was very excg  that is just the openg of the Harry's  fourth year at Hogwarts  If only my classes were as excg
Harry Potter is growg up  this book reflects that The dangers are me threateng the laughs me frequent I found the book to be the best yet but parents should prepare young children who want to read this  bookI don't want to say much about the sty  give anythg away to  those wag to read  We do learn that there are three European schools  of wizardry Hogwarts Beauxbatons  Durmstrang Each puts up a champion  f the Triwizard Tournament which ties together what happens  Harry's  fourth year We meet Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons  Vikt Krum from  Durmstrang characters who will hopefully reappear  books 5-7 As the  years have gone on the skirmishes between Harry  Ld Voldemt have  gotten me tense  Goblet of Fire doesn't disappot When everythg  is done you'll know why the last chapter is called &quotThe  Begng&quot
I spend the better part of the weekend devourg the new Harry Potter  It did not disappot!  Once aga Rowlg takes the reader on the roller-coaster ride of Harry's le  It's hard to review this book whout  spoilers so I'll just say that I was happy that everythg does not get  neatly summed up  the last chapters  I'm already anxious f Book 5  The new characters ( some old characters) are not what they seem to be  (as usual)  I especially loved all the &quotsocial commentary&quot  packed to this book  She covers gender bias classism racism   nationalismto name only a few No &quotpreachg&quot no lessons  driven down the reader's throats - but gives the reader a chance to see  people teract  struggle wh these issues  the magical wld This  book is most certaly f an older reader  I thk there will be much  me controversy over this one  Parents  Educats will have a tougher  time wh this book but fans who are a ltle older ( a lot older like  me) will enjoy !  Welcome back Harry!
This is an excellent addion to the Harry Potter series It contues to provide vivid descriptions of the wizardg wld develop memable characters  to twist/turn the plot  unexpected ways
This fourth outg  the Harry Potter series is the first to suffer from the overwhelmg success of the first three Although  is the longest of the three  covers the least ground  terms of style While Harry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire has compellg descriptions of the Quiddch  Wld Cup as well as a wizardly competion that unleashes many new spells   creatures somehow  feels like the series has lost s heart  Yes  adolescent angst comes to Harry  his Hogwarts companions  but  is a  superficial style which somehow feels unwthy of Rowlg's talents A  style about the Daily Prophet the wizardg wld's tabloid newspaper  feels like the auth's attempt to take a stab at the unwelcome attention  she has received from the press The book has been described as  &quotpivotal&quot but has the unsatisfyg feelg of beg filler  material rather than havg substance There is a &quottune   tomrow&quot qualy to book IV that leaves the reader unsatisfied As a  HUGE fan of the first three books I may hold the auth to impossibly high  stardsbut those stards were set by her previous effts I will  still look fward to Book V but wh hope that  returns to the heart of  the matterHarry's quest f identy  f family
It fally arrived! 700+ pages! I've read the first 12 chapters  they are great! My sister loves  too she got her own copy so we wouldn't fight &ltg&gt
The Goblet of Fire at first glance seems a b dauntg  at 700 plus pages  is me than the average child is used too But Ms Rowlgs clearly tends us to snuggle up close to our kids  read them this fe novel of wizardry  frendship  I could not put  down!From the  moment the Weasleys pick up Harry from his clueless Muggle family I was on  the flo wh laughter
Once aga Rowlg does not disappot!  Harry Potter #4 a gargantuan yet captivatg wk keeps you riveted f every one of 's 734 pages  Goblet of Fire is a lot darker than Rowlg's other wk  does seem  aimed to a slightly me mature audience which wks as  seems   keepg wh the growg matury of Harry  the other characts  That  said the book retas the charm of the previous 3 wh a number of thgs  to make you chuckle sprkled throughout the pages The end is wonderful  contag several surprises  several confirmations of thgs that  readers have suspected f the entire series  What's even better is that   leaves a lot of opengs that will keep Potter fans speculatg until  #5 which can't possibly be wrten soon enough!  It's defely a good  read  one that will keep you up at night unable to put  down
This is a pivotal book  the Harry Potter series The sty-le is impressive  the characters wondeful As usual the true villa besides  You-Know-Who is a complete surprise Hermione's character is growg up   this book  we can expect plenty me from her  the future  Yes there  is a death  the book but  did not come as a big surprise as to who  would die The topic self is dealt wh grace  sensivy I would  not fear allowg my kids to read Lookg fward to the next book   the series already
This book is like sogreat!  Wh the other three you kd of get an troduction to Harry Potter  the wld of wonderous wizards etc  But  this one  blows up  I mean the plot's absolutely fabulous (no pun here)  I really love the book  I'm 17  feel kda odd readg them  but seriously they are f all ages  But  the fourth book the  first three are the tro this is the begng  Befe this Voldemt  is really just a threat  the background that has done stuff  the past  In this one he strikes out  actually enters the sty  At the end  everyone is busy scramblg to preparethen  ends  The book ends  Drat  I want the next 3 now!  ACK!  Oh well  I'll just have to  waanyway  This book takes you from the Wld Cup to the Triwizard  Tournament to Voldemtthe book's filled wh everythg that makes me  love Hogwart's  wish I lived  Engl just to see  I could get on  platfm 9  3/4's The book's great :o)
Harry Potter &amp The Goblet of Fire does not disappot It is as grippg  ventive as the first three HP books  the wld of Hogwarts is as magical  absbg as everThere are some very funny moments (the campg scenes at the Quiddch Wld Cup f example) me  stirrg wds from Dumblede  the closg pages of the book but  overall the wd f this HP book has got to be 'DARK'! Danger has been  present  each of the HP books of course but never as menacg as this  Goblet of Fire is dferent from the others  that when you reach the end  you no longer feel that all's right wh the wldOn a lighter note  the development of the characters of Ron Hermione  Harry is excellent  You really feel they are growg as people  already seem que dferent  to the characters we first met on the Hogwarts Express  book one  Hermione especially is gettg very strident! There are some awkward  teenage moments tooHavg said all that though I do feel the book is  overlong  is que slow to start It really only gets crackg about  half-way through I absolutely loved Prisoner of Azkaban  thought   was one of the best books of 1999 (should have won the Whbread book of  the year!)  I thk this one isn't que up there wh  so that's  why I give  four stars
After readg this book I am eager f the relese of Harry Potter 5 but am sad to know  will come out  about  not me than 6 months It was very imagative will great detail  a good sty It starts out  talkg about an old man who use to wk f the Riddles a family who  mysteriously died 50 years later the old man goes back to the house  suspectg teenagers have started  a fire but fds a man named Wmtail   you- know-who But I've said enough already!  I also heard that JK  Rowlg also signed a contract f the movie That could be good
JKRowlg has done  aga! Book Four of the seven book series is probably the most eagerly anticipated book of the year   was certaly wth wag f Harry Ron  Hermione are all back at Hogwarts f  their fourth year  this year hold me suprises  problems than last  year! Once aga the school has a new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher  known only as Profess 'Mad - Eye' Moody Sirius Black assumes his role as  Harry's Godfather even whilst on the run  Harry gets to speak to his  late parents Whilst these books often cheer the heart this latest creation  had me  tears because of s poigniancy Whilst Rowlg could have made  Harry's meetg wh his parents credibly cheesy what James  Lily  Potter say to their son is heart wrenchg stuff  Not only is this book  sad  also an hystarical tale of the three Gryffd's first dates Two  schools come to vis Hogwarts  you can image the outcry when the  female students fd out that one of them is the famous Quiddch Player  Vikt Krum Plus many Hogwarts students attend The Quiddch Wld Cup  This new book is double the size of 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'  each page  is brilliant The characters are well sculpted  the sty le is  typically superb Rumours are true I'm afraid: One of the characters does  die But you'll have to read this fantastic book to fd out who  If you  want to know how great this book is put  this way: It was released on  Saturday over here s now Monday afternoon I watched Pete Sampras play  tennis  that was about the only pot at which I could put this  legendary book down MISS THIS AT YOUR PERIL!
the moment i got this book i locked myself  my room  did not do anythg f two days but read  It is the best book ever wrten!  eight thumbs up! 40 stars! a 14 out of ten!
I just received this book yesterday   was so good I haven't put  down sce! Rowlg seems to be aimg  towards me mature readers as Harry  his friends grow older but she hasn't lost the charm she always  puts to her characters This is a great book  as usual she leaves  you wag impatiently f the next book! Only another year to go!
I recived the book late last eveng( the day  came out)  read  I was shocked at how much the books are imppvg even when they are already great This is by far my fave from the four It left me wh an  understg why kids were dyg f this book Action packed as usual   the adolescent Harry has a crush as well as adventure The overall  event of the book topped the last three by far i don't want to ru  f  anyone IT would be  a MISTAKE not to purchase this book f yourself  a  child
The book was a wonderful read very hard to put down I was really impressed at the pacg never a dull moment The plot was full of action  trigue each chapter drawg you deeper  deeper to the sty   pushg you to contue readg From the glious detail of the Quiddch  Wld Cup Triwizard Tournament  the Yule Ball to a showdown wh  Voldemt There were many trigug plot twists to keep you guessg what  is gog to happen next It's very apparent  this book that Harry  his  friends are growg up ternal friction  the discovery of the oppose  sex are beg quietly developed along wh the plot to give the ma  characters a greater depth that adolescents will identy wh There are  plenty of new magic spells  terestg creatures to keep the fantasy  mded well engaged The book does deed have a darker feel to   especially the last third a character does die  we are given a glimpse  that darker times are comg  future of the series but the tone is still  light enough that younger readers won't be disappoted
I was concerned that HP4 would not be wthy of all of the fanfare  anticipation that the actual book would backfire like a Spellotaped w Thank God I was wrong - very wrong!  Harry  Co endure a fourth year  completely unlike their previous years their adventures are all new   the challenges which they face from classes  each other are fresh but  believable JK Rowlg doesn't just tell a sty she wres like she was  there  is just fillg you   Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  is peppered wh new  entertag characters cludg starchy  misters feign wizards house-elves  even a Jack Palance-ish  Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher This is Hogwart's though thgs  are rarely as they seem  This book is a roller-coaster ride  the dark  You thk you know where the ride is gog a couple of hills a curve  then zip! -you're off  a new direction  then you drop down a huge  hill then another! Zip! you're gog left  pretty darned fast too! And  another hill! ( How could there be any me hills?) And just when you know  that this may be the best ride ever you ease  to the station slightly  stunned but droolg f me  Thank you  Ms Rowlg - this was well  wth the wa  I'm queueg up f the ride on #5!
I honestly did not thk that this novel would live up entirely to the hype that surrounded   But as I got further  further to Harry Potter's latest adventure the Quiddch Wld Cup  the Triwizard  Tournament  became harder  harder to put the book down  I would like  to say though that while readg this book I noticed many wds phrases   Brish idioms that would confuse the average ten year old  I am 17   my 12 year old sister has already asked numerous questions referrg to  the language wh the first few chapters  Although I believe younger  readers may have trouble wh some of the phrases  does greatly enrich  the novel older readers makg  very wth the 734 pages  J K  Rowlg's language usage is also trigug  helped to keep me readg   She has succeeded  her goals of makg the sty darker  me  developed  I was on the edge of my seat f the last 8 chapters (37  total)  The twists that developed  these chapters had me guessg until  the last page  I was left on the last page wh many questions  Will Ld  Voldemt w?  Will Harry survive?  Will Sirius ever be safe wh Harry?   Will Dumblede ever convce Fudge of the truth?  If you liked the first  three you're punishg yourself not to read the 4th
A great book that has not only kept up wh the previous books but also set future tracks f the upcomg books  A wonderful sty that will show anybody that they can do anythg  I got the book  read  the firt  day!  It was phenomenal  Rowlgs has done  aga showg kids  everywhere to believe  read  From her imagation to her outstg  style  I hope everybody enjoys this book as much as i did!
I got Harry Potter 4 on Saturday afternoon  read  through at once Somehow part 4 feels me 'grown-up' than the others  Tempers are risg as puberty is gettg nearer -  also how long can you take beg po   less famous than your friend? And yes 's gettg darker as Rowlg  said herself Someone got killed which made me cry but that is not all  The bad guys are still 100% bad but the good guys are gettg gray rather  than stayg all-whe And who of the good guys will rema loyal? I put  the book down feelg sadder wiser  me grown up than after say  Vol1  2
I spent a most enjoyable weekend readg this book  I'm constantly amazed at the auth's imagation she keeps comg up wh all sts of wonderful new characters  details  I haven't gotten so much pleasure  out of readg sce I was a kid readg the JRR Tolkien booksMy  daughter has several friends who have started readg as a direct result of  these books  They are actually turng off the TV  pickg up books
Havg thoughly enjoyed readg the first three books wh my 11 year old son the fourth book is a disappotment It took 200 pages f the first excg plot twist to develop (when Harry is mysteriously entered  to the championship contest) The puzzles  clever feshadowg that  marked the earlier books seem to have gotten lost The fal 100 pages of  the book cludes a number of extended monologues which have the ma  characters directly explag how the plot makes sense rather than the  much me terestg manner of the earlier books  which the pieces fall  to place wh only a few choice revelations towards the conclusion At  700+ pages I truly hope this series followg sticks wh  f what I  hope will be a fth book much me  keepg wh the first three
I just bought this book 2 days ago the day  came out  I've already read ! I love  along wh the other three Harry Potter books Anyone who read ( liked) those books defetly needs to pick up The Goblet of  Fire This is a book anyone can enjoy from age 8 to 88 no one can resist  Harry Potter! I reccomend the whole series to anyone who enjoys a good  fantasy/magical/mystery book
fantastic spir-ltg page-turng wonderful magical style we've come to love  expect from JK Rowlg  the Harry Potter series-- lots of !F those wried about the 700-plus page count wry not--you'll fly through  like Harry's Firebolt  Parents however  readg to small children might get tired readg  to kids at bedtime--a  chapter might take me than a half hour  And the entire book might take  you an entire summer  Speakg of parents beware--&quotGoblet of  Fire&quot employs a tad b me darkness than Rowlg has shown us   books 1-3Towards the end the plot becomes  rather convoluted--wonderfully so--but aga kids might need a diagram  drawn to show them just where the plot branched off swirled around   thrashed like a Whompg Willow&quotGoblet of Fire&quot--this cup  runneth over wh magic  wonder  JK Rowlg does not disappot
I have read all of the series  like most people was anxiously awag the 4th It did not let down my expectations The Goblet of Fire is clever  well wrten resultg  the most terestg of the series yet It is almost completely dferent from the first three wh a much me  complex sty resultg  the totalled 735 pgs Instead of beg a  complete sty wh a series  is me of a contuation of the others   leaves off at the end makg you feel hungry f me This book is  defly one of the most excg  exhileratg  is the best yet of  any
While I enjoyed Harry Potter immensely  is easy to tell Harry Ron  Hermione are growg up While the first book  the series was ideal f younger readers book 4 is like s ma characters me mature Some of  the hum (  one stance the language) may make parents crge at  the idea of their children (say eight  under) readg  The plot is  also a tad b darker However I aded   found  despe beg  over 700 pages long entirely too sht It will be a long wa until Book  5-Rowlg leaves many threads open f the sequel Overall a wonderful  addion to what is truly becomg a series of modern classics
This was just as good as any of the Harry Potter series I got  on Saturday when  was released  didn't put  down until i fished   It took me less than 2 days to read all 700+ pages It is just as  captivatg  as magical as the first three novels I can't wa f the  next one!  It is a ltle sad  a ltle scary but  is great! If  you have not read the Harry Potter series I sugest you start but start  wh the first one Readg them out of der would be confusg I don't  care how old you are I am nearly 17  love them  both of my  parents 47  48 love them as well They are NOT just children's books!
Harry Potter  The Goblet of Fire was by far the best Harry Potter book It delves deeper to the histy of the magical wld  has many good parts My fave is the part is the one  the graveyard when well I  don't want to ru the endg f you but  you liked the first three  books you'll love this one
Ah!  Another book another success  This book although not the best is by far the longest  provides everyone wh a good dose of Harry Potter  My son  daughter both love this book  they read  back to  backWonderful!
What a great book!  I stayed up all night readg   fished at 5 the next mng  I couldn't put  down whout knowg what was gog to happenIf you have never read any of the previous books this book is  still good because  summerizes eveythg that has happened so far as  Harry begs another year at Hogwarts  The characters are developed  a  natural way whout cuttg qualy  We see the three ma characters grow    friendship as well as maturyI recommend this book to children  (Muggle  otherwise  of all ages)everywhere
The latest Harry Potter book is just as excg  surprisg as the first  This book has a few twists  unexpected turns    In his fourth year Harry goes to a wld cup quiddch map wh the Weasley's befe returng to school  When he returns to school there is a very  excg tournament takg place-which is where the fun  surprises  beg! I loved this book as much as the first one  I do not thk you  will be disappoted when readg !
I've been wag f MONTHf  this!  I can't believe how thick this book ! I hope to get  done befe next week I love Harry Potter JK Rowlg has a real flair f wrg! Keep  up!
The Goblet of Fire is 734 pages long but don't let this timidate you  This is the best book yet wh some serious owl post excg challenges  a thrillg clhanger that will drive you sane! Maj problems arise  at the end that make you wonder wether  not Harry  his friends can  survive  I rate this a five star book because I could not put  down I  don't thk I can wa f the next one
I have been readg fantasy  sci f 20 years  The Harry Potter books are a great read f people of any age  The fourth book contues to be trigg all the way through  It is great to be able to share your  excment wh a child  be talkg the same language  The sties are  becomg me complex as the character ages which makes the sties een  me terestg  I wish Rowlg to wre faster I want to see what  happens next This book ( the others  the series) are a must read -   while your at  read  wh a child
Bigger yes but better?  Madame Rowlg has told another rivetg stallment of the young wizard's tale  a whoppg 734 pages which all the diehards will buy  My 13-year-old son  I had a rual whereby as the books came out I read them aloud to him over the space of a few days  but this time I ended up synopsisg the book  only readg the last  four chapters aloud  His assessment was &quotWow Mom the ltle kids  are gog to have nightmares&quot wh which I agree I underst that  Ms Rowlg is uppg the ante as her perceived audience grows up along  wh Harry Ltle Orphan Annie this is not  But she contues to gather 7   8-year-old fans as well  Perhaps a warng on the book: &quotCaution  content not necessarily suable f young children&quot?  Don't get me  wrong 's a great book  the teen market is an abyss except f this  series  As a mother of two teens who ade Harry I'm grateful f this  fourth book  we're all on le f the next one!
Long but you need the length  a lot happens to harry  theothers  this book  non stop action  wonderful detail  the bestone yet!have you noticed that they are gettg longer?  Jk rowlg is a great wrer   this is your first harry potter book go  get the others they are great too
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is absolutely amazg! I loved  from the begng to the end I fished  que fast probably because I was so exced The endg of the book offers que a surprise was not  the endg I was expectg at all  believe meI'm usually very good at  predictg what is gog to happen  books This book is full of so many  twists  turns 's like ridg on a rollar coaster It's the best  I  would recommend  f anyoneyoung  old Totally great f stirrg up  your imagation BUY IT AND READ IT!
Yes!  As devoted Harry Potter fans my children  I were  le at midnight to buy the book  I was almost hesant to start readg because I would have been so disappoted   had not lived up to the first three  books  Never fear JK Rowlg delivers  It begs wh a darker tone than  the rest  puts you immediately on the edge of your seat  Then you're  off to the Quiddch Wld Cup Harry is among friends  all is happy  then me mysterious happengs  Befe you know  is three o'clock   the mng  you still don't want to put the book down
This book contues on the greatness of the other Potter books! I'm still only fished half the book  so far s great!
She has outdone herself wh this one  There are so many twists  turns along wh ltle suprises everywhere that I could not put  down  Her imagation  skilled stytellg leave me  awe  I recommend the entire series f anyone  Excellent job Ms Rowlg
Greatest book  the series yet Longer but me tense  gratyg
There is really only one wd I can thk of to describe the latest Harry Potter book credible  The auth has once aga created lovable  believable characters while still matag the qualy of the sty   Truly Ms Rowlg has out-done herself once aga  This book kept me  readg to the wee hours of the mng  I can honestly say that this is  a must-read f anyone who is cravg a good book
The Harry Potter books were all really good! The whole series have been followed closely by many people but when you actually read the fourth book I thk most people will fd  dferent from all the rest! It also takes  a big step when one of the characters is killed (I will not say who!) And  I am sure that everyone has noticed that  is clearly the longest book! I  thk that the plot is very good  that the book is very well wrten!  Although this year Harry is kept busy durg the summer! Of course Harry is  still always  trouble  still sneakg around the school! But all the  same  is a ltle dferent from all the rest of the Harry Potter books!  (I did not say really much about the plots so those that have not read   will not fd out anythg!)  ~Enjoy~
I found &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot to be just as excg  entertag as the previous books  not me so Rowlgs is a great styteller  all her familiar trademarks are here: the colful  eccentric characters the hum the playful use of wds the  masterful cultivation of suspense The book is over seven hundred pages  long but at the end you'll be wishg  were longer There isn't a slow  spot  The sty is however dferent  some ways from the  previous ones It's a lot darker  scarier f one thg Voldemt   his suppters play a proment role    their malice fms a  palpable undercurrent  the plot from chapter one on By the end of the  sty you get to see just HOW evil Voldemt  his mions actually are  And let me tell you they're pretty evilThe other big  dference is that Harry Ron Hermione  their friends are startg to  grow up The boys  girls have begun to notice each other now  all  the familiar problems of adolescence--jealousy secury fear of  rejection desire to f -- st out--are startg to descend on them  I enjoy seeg the characters evolve  this way but those who would  rather they stay eternal 11-year-olds may be disappotedThe sty is  not as self-contaed as those  the previous books Many plot les are  left open at the end presumably to be resolved  books #5 6  7 If  you thk you had a hard time wag f &quotGoblet of Fire&quot to  come out wa till you fish   are left thkg about the next  one!All  all I highly recommend this book If you're already a Harry  Potter fan you won't be disappoted   you're not readg  might  very well make you one
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire By far is the best book yet  It takes a lot of unexpected twists  turns  when they say 's the pivotal book  is THE pivotal book You will underst why I said this toward the  end of the book Everybody I've got two wds f you: BUY IT
The endg is the best! You feel as  you've been drawn to the book If a chachter is  pa you feel as  your  pa Two chachters return Dobby  Padfoot! Don't miss out on the greatest Harry Potter book yet!
The long-awaed fourth Harry Potter book doesn't dissapot although  dfers  content  fmat from the first three me than you might expect given their strong similary  success  First of all the book  is not only long-awaed but also LONG  At 700-0dd pages  nearly  doubles the length of the first one  The length of the book is both an  asset  a &quotsht&quotcomg On one h  allows Rawlg to  reveal much me about the mysterious wizardg wld about which the  readers previously knew very ltle  F example there are  turns out  other wizardg schools The length also allows Rawlgs to fulfill her  promise of bombardg the ma characters wh hmones  the effects  are fairly comic as we fd that our child-heroes are not children anyme  Fally Rawlgs serted many me clues about the future of the series   this book than  the others  Not only do we see future battles shapg  up f Harry Her-my-oh-nee  Ron but we see _futures_ as well  Despe all these signicant plusses the book's length fostered some  sloppess not found  the other three  Not all the ends were well tied  up-- while  could be argued that they will be  future books  Rawlgs has never needed to rest to that tactic befe preferrg to  tightly control _every_ element of the sty  tight vignettes that fish  wh each book  The series is begng to read me like a series than  a series of novels (Examples of un--poly-tied-ends are SPEW  Nelville's histy the function of the bubopus  others that I can't  reveal whout revealg the endg)  Fally some of the early events   the novel lose their signicance by the end of the book even though they  are crucial to figurg out &quotwhodunn&quot  By the time the  perpetrat of the Death Mark is revealed we've fgotten how imptant  the Death Mark was  Stronger edg would have solved this problem me  satisfactily But then aga who's complag--me Harry Potter is  what the wld wants But then aga who's complag--me Harry Potter is  what the wld wants
I would love the Harry Potter series  f no other reason that  is gettg kids to READ  'll be a steppg stone to the wlds of books ( away from the tv set)  I love to read everythg from Tolkien  to Caesar's Commentaries  I hope that Harry Potter will spread this  joy But I love these books because they're just alot of fun  I'm a  systems anaylst no kids myself but I grabbed Harry Potter  the Goblet  of Fire as soon as  h the shelves  I started readg  at 8PM   fished  at 2AMBuy   Read   Have fun
This stallment  Rawlg's prized book series outshes other children's books  creativy  conttuy  This book reads so smoothly  is captivatg The characters reach a new depth  the Goblet  of Fire that they never did  the previous books  the series  Not to  say that the other books were not excellent  I was wried whether the  fourth book would live up to the hype surroundg   I found that   excelled expectations  This book sends Harry Potter on me adventures  than any other befe   leaves the reader clueless as to what twist   the plot will happen next  The endg is a complete  shockg suprise  The characters seem me  depth because readers that read the first three  books  the series are watchg the students at Hogwarts grow-up  I  recommend the entire series to anyone that enjoys superbly imagative  books
JK Rowlg did  aga! another great book I bought this book the day  came out  couldn't put  down 'til I fished I Loved the Yule Ball I found myself laughg at people tryg to fd a date  I can't  wa f the next book!
The 4th Harry Potter is amazg! I could't put the book down I just had to keep readg! I highly recomend this book Trust me you won't regret  How ever  was me violent then the last 3 Me violence  profany I thk this is NOT a good book f children under 7 There is  not a Quiddch cup at Hogwarts this year but you get plenty of Quiddch  when Harry attends the Quiddch wld cupHarry attends  wh Hermione  Ron  his family(Bill  Charlie cluded)But the fun stops when a  group of Death-Eaters gather so the Mistary of Magic has to step When  Harry gets to Hogwarts he fds out that the Quiddch Championchip is  canceled due to the first Triwizard Chanpionchip  years JKRowlg  troduces maney new characts cludg Mr Crouch  Mr Bagman of the  mistary of magic Ra Skeeter the anoyg  nosy repter f the  Daily Prophet(you'll grow to hate her)  students from Beauxbatons   Durmstrang which are other schools of wchcraft  wizardryIt might take  you awhile (734 pages)but you'll enjoy every page of 
I thought  was very good! There are a lot of new characters Some are: Wky the house elf &quotMad Eye&quot Moody Ra Skeeter  many me! I'm sry to say that there are no Quiddch matches at Hogwarts this  year Instead There is somethg else It's called a Triwizard Tournament  The end is happy  sad at the same time  I just hope you like the book  as much as I did!
Even though  was 734 pages long not one wd of Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is bg  The whole sty is basically about the strange happengs to do wh the Triwizard Tournament an competetion that  hasn't been held  a 100 years due to the death toll risg to high   previous competions There are many other thgs gog on too dealg  wh some particaurlly nasty teachers hlg bg skrewts  care of  magical creatures class  gettg up the nerve to ask a girl to the Yule  Ball It is never dull  the hundreds of pages will zoom by  no time  Don't take my wd f  though ask anyone that's read  They will all  tell you the same thg This book is amazg
I've only gotten to page 80 but I still bet  will be 5 stars! My friend said  was great she read  the day  came out I havent gotten to any surprisg parts yet but there will be!
I was soooo exced to receive my copy of the new Harry Potter book!  After stg  le on Friday night / Saturday mng I scurried home to read this next stallment  All I can say is &quotWOW!&quot I can't  believe I waed f 35 mutes  le  paid money f this book  If  you liked the other Harry Potter books you will be nothg sht of  disappotedI found the plot confusg the characters less than  terestg  I really didn't fd that any new terry was covered    was much darker than the other 3 books  I had planned to give a  copy to my nephew f his birthday - but I have now decided agast  !I'm afraid that this series is fizzlg out!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was by far the best Harry Potter book wrten so far Harry  his friends have many adventures  all the great characters are back  this edion New sides of Ron Hermione  Hagrid Dumblede  Harry are shown as they go through the fourth year  at Hogwarts I couldn't put  down!
I was not expectg to become a Harry Potter fan when I read the first book  All I can really say about the fourth is I enjoyed  so much I spent my entire Sunday on the couch readg  It was a b long but wth   entirely  As a teacher  is encouragg to see kids terested   readg Brg on number 5!
No book could live up to the pre-publication hype f HARRY POTTER IV I'd really like to give this book 3 1/2 stars--'s not good enough f 4 but not bad enough f 3  The fal 200 pages are very good but the first 500  feel padded  logy especially the Quiddch Wld Cup which goes on f  the better part of 80 pages  only volves Harry tangentially (my  suspicion is that Rowlg ran to her deadle  didn't have time to  ed properly) The confrontation that spans Chapters 32 - 34 is very good   just about wth the price of admission  But I thk 's a b of a  cruelty to children to ask them to wk their way through 734 pages to get  there I don't know  I would have had that kd of patience when I was  12 M pots: what kd of &quottournament&quot stretches out over 6  months? Sce two of the other players  the tournament are students from  other schools we're asked to believe that they spend the better part of a  year as exchange students at Hogwarts--but they don't take classes isn't  this a hole  the sty?  I'd comment on the death  chapter 32 but I  don't want to reveal details that would spoil the sty f other readers  (but I thk 's another case of too much fuss  hype)  I thk the  &quotUranus&quot joke on page 201 is appropriate f Rowlg's readers   I'm surprised her eds didn't catch 
Ms Rowlg has mataed her high stards  given us a book every b as engrossg as the first three  the series  A much darker year f Harry to be sure  The content seems to be maturg along wh s hero  There are plenty of the plot twists  character surprises we've come to  expect as well as tidbs about the polics  passions of the wizardg  wld that make  seem me rich  complex wh every page I have been  readg the series at bedtime to my 8  10 year old children but they  were away at camp when I picked up Book IV so I thought I'd browse through   first Two days  700+ pages later my first thought was - &quotWhen  is Book V comg out  how soon can I put  my der! &quot
This is another action packed example of JK Rowlg's genius at providg books that appeal to children of all ages  The sty that began  the first three books contues wh many challenges opptunies   surprisesMany characters mentioned  not fully expled  pri  books are exped upon  Characters who have moved on are cluded   brief glimpses so that we know what they are dog nowAnd all of our  fave characters contue to provide enough action to keep you  hookedIt's rare that I fd a series that gets better as  goes along  The Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter yet  WELL wth the  wa!Can't wa f number 5!
The book was Great!  The only regrets I have about readg  so soon is that I have to wa so long f the next one!  Great characters  a great plot
This trigug long awaed sequel was a book I couldn't put down sce the moment I set my hs on   It is about a dangerous tournament (which Harry participates ) between three wizardg schools  As many of you  have heard yes someone (good) does die    The end was a b tricky  yet I fd  is still the best book that I've ever read
Despe the longer length of Harry Potter #4 the book seemed to fly by  This is just as good as the first three sucessfully creatg the wld of Wizards  particularly the Hogwarts school  Like  the previous  volumes Harry  his friends must fight Dark Magic whout knowg f  sure who they can trust  Highlights clude Hermoe's campaign to help  house elves  Percy Weasley's new job which makes him even me self  imptant than he was as a prefect The only complat I really have is  that so many new characters are troduced I began to have trouble keepg  them straight  Fans of Harry will not be disappoted
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  outstg! It is packed wh suspense  action but also has some comic relief It is pretty scary  the end  also que sad after a character is killed This is my fave  book of the series so far
After readg this wondeful stallment to the wld-renowned series I daresay that I couldn't take my hs off the book A S$3319 trip to the Triwizard Tournament Quiddch Wld Cup a look at the Dark Mark  Profess Moody  a vis to Hagrid Profess Dumblede  Dobby was  defely wth ! And most of all the excement is that Voldemt is  back
F the most part this book was as entertag  hard to put down as the first three books  the series  However  contaed aome events that were disturbg  This is a book that you'll want to read befe your  younger children do so that you can discuss  wh them  Although the  auth does a pretty good job catchg up on the style of the first  three  would still be hard to underst everythg whout havg read  the other books  the series  It's a fun  suspenseful book to read   I thk that most Harry Potter fans won't be disappoted
I bought the book  London  read  on the plane back to Los Angeles  I thk that children will really enjoy this next enstallment which deals wh me mature themes  has an tricate plotle Although much longer  than the earlier books JK Rowlg managed to keep the pace at a nice  clip  held my terest throughout the bookLiberate the house-elfs!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the absolute best book I've ever read!  I loved the other three books  the series too but I thk this one can top them all I wished  could go on fever but like all good  thgs  had to come to an end If your lookg f credible books to  read the &quotHarry Potter&quot series is f you!
Harry Potter 4 is an ecsellent book maikg you not want to put  down developg everythg  the most amazg real le manner that convces everyone that  is real
Simply JK Rowlg has successfully brought Harry Potterto the page whout leavg any doubt that the series will contueon wh further success to come She's great There's a certa simplicy she wres wh that doesn't talk below  above the level of any reader  the sties she tells are top-notch This latest stallment of Harry Potter is no exception The plot wks slowly through the book--she doesn't rush  at the same time doesn't tell the sty at a drudgg pace What's me she's allowg her characters--Harry Ron  Hermione especially--to grow up  's terestg to look back at the previous books  thk of how they've changed Because they haveThere are moments  this book (as well as  all the series) that make you want to break to a cheer  others that make you want to tell Harry  Co that everythg's gog to be okay The emotional draw to these people is amazg  she wres them wh great clary  visionIn closgShe's done  aga
As an adult reader of Harry Potter I have an terestg perspective on these entertag  by no means childish books  While the fourth  the series is by far the longest  does not lack any of the mystery   excg supsense that were prevalent  the first three  I strongly  reccommend this series to those who are young  especially to those who  are still young-at-heart
This is an excellent book JK has done  aga wh Goblet ofFire Even though  is substantially longer than the others  iswell wth the commment It is dested to be a classic along wh the rest of the Harry Potter series
As soon as I opened the book I knew I was  f another greatride Even better because this book was twice as long as spredecesss What really impressed me was the feelg that I had stepped right back to the same sty wh the same people I loved ( loved to hate) The 4th year at Hogwart's brgs me characters  me complexy to the tale of Harry  his wld  It was like puttg on a fave comftable coat  fdg $100  the pocket I was concerned that  might be a letdown after 3 great books  the credible promotion campaign WRONG !  This is a furious flight  I f one kept thkg &quotOne me chapter one me chapter&quot all night long Harry's development as a young man  as a wizard is excg  gratyg  Be sure to read the books  der as each builds on the previous one  The only bad moment f me was when I realized that there were only a few pages left befe this stallment was over When is #5 beg released? I bought 2 because my 13 yr old nephew was as anxious as I to read the newest Harry  High praises from Calnia!
Friday night I was up till 3 AM wh this book  the onlyreason I put  down was because I had thgs to do  themng JKRowlg has outdone herself this time wh an almost epic novel that is much dferent from the others  the series much darker  scarier( you've read  you know the part I'm talkg about) JK doesn't follow the usual fmat of her books eher This time  takes much longer f Harry to return to Hogwarts  the events that take place are not the nm f example no Quiddch matches A thoughly excg book  a must-read f all ages
This is a pivotal book deed!Characters from other books are brought back  many new characters appear We learn me about the wizardg wld outside of Hogwarts Potter  his friends have the same charm that  captured my attention  the first book The fight aga Voldemt  contues  the fight between good  evil becomes me dangerous I  already can't wa f book 5 Rowlg once aga pulls to a wld of  which I didn't want to leave I picked up the book  didn't put  down  until the end I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Harry Potter  fan!
Sce I am reviewg  very early after the book came out (three days) I don't want to say much about  but I will  a few weeks though It just has great plot turns  a very unexpected endg My only gripe is that   was obvious who was gog to die
I adm  I'm 29 yrs old an I love the Harry Potter series  Bought the book first thg Saturday mng  fished Sunday afternoon  I don't want to give anythg away regardg the plot but f all who have yet to  experience the Harry Potter phenomenon grab a broomstick (a Firebolt  preferably)  jump on  And f anyone who's a b leery of the book's  size--don't be  It reads fast  the sty has enough twists  turns to  keep even the most easily distracted reader terested I honestly thk  that Goblet of Fire is the best of the series thus far  The transfmation  of Harry  his friends from children to young adults is que evident  here  makes f wonderful readg  So stop readg this review  buy  the book!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderful contuation of the terric series  Rowlg contues to she on the terestg  humerous details of le amongst wizards  young Harry faces some of his  toughest challenges yet  The endg leaves no doubt that Harry's remag  years at Hogwarts school will be suspense-filled f the entire wizardly  wld yet le contues apace wh developments between Harry Ron   Hermione's friendship  The book is me outwardly focused than the  previous volumes wh wld events as imptant as le side Hogwarts  This is  le wh Harry's broader vision as he maturesI read this  book  less than 24 hours -  pulls you along exably  que  enjoyably  Hurrah f Harry Potter!
I read this book  48 hours  was unable to put  down - unexpected endg - unlike all the rest  I thk you would have to have read all three pri books to get the most out of the fourth  the series  It is very imagative wh lots of good ideas  surprises along the way  I  would recommend  to everyone as  was an extremely good book  Thanks J  R Rowlg  I hope there is me than seven  the series - YOU ROCK!
This is my fave book of the series so far It is filled wh action  suspense but also has some comic relief It is such  outstg book that I wish I could give ne than 5 stars!
Fished  last night - great book It defely goes deeper  darker than the first three but still has that universal st of feel to  - this is a classic stantly The characters new  old are as charmg  lovable as always You can read this wh  whout havg read the  other three Eher way  rocks!
JK contues Harry's adventures at Hogwarts (a boardg school f wizards) as a four-year wh the tradional cast of villians  beloved characters -- plus a few new mysterious students The fmula is known to  the many Harry fans out there  admtedly the sheer creativeness of the  book is lower than the first two of the series  (which is me a cred to  the earlier books than a discred to HP  the Goblet of Fire) but the  book is nevertheless entrallgSome of the stereotypical ptrayals of  the bureocratic hierarchy wh the Mistry of Magic will appeal me to  adults  Harry's teenage issues (such as datg woes)will appeal me to  that age group too -- small children might therefe not be as enthralled  wh the me than 600 page stallment of the seriesThe book does  further the revelations of recognizable charater's pasts   most  certaly prepares the dramatic suation f Book #5 startg once me  wh Harry's end-of-summer woes at the Dursleys --  chapter 2 Chapter 1  lays the groundwk ( most of the drama) f the year -- but I won't  spoil  f you!

This book is the best of the four published so far supptedby the strongest plot yet  many quick turns to the sty whichthrows you off-balance It still retas most of the old elements  troduces some new ones as well The new charcters are very well implamented makg you feel like they've been  the seris all along Rowlg as usual has tried to wre this book to the very highest stard possible   shows If you had any doubts gettg &quotHarry Potter  the goblet of fire&quot this article should have squashed them all
I was stg on the couch at home when my neighb called He asked  I wanted to brow the new Harry Potter book Of course I said yes I sat down  began to read At first I was put off by the length of the book  but  was credibly fast paced  adventurous Harry Potter returns to  school f his fourth year  fds himself entered anonymously to the  Triwizard Tournement You are troduced to some terestg new  characters but you still keep up wh the previos characters such as Dobby  from book #2 I was completly swept away while readg this book It took  me less than 1 day to fish Harry potter  the Goblet of Fire I cannot  wa f the fth book!
The &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is the best of the Harry Potter series so farWhen Harry goes to the Quiddich Wld Cup the fans are attacked by Death Eaters  the Dark Mark is seen  the sky claimg Ld  Voldemt to be risg to powerThe Tri-Wizard Tournament is beg held  at Hogwarts f the first time  many years  Harry gets chosen as the  fourth champion  From there Harry is challenged wh many dangers that  threaten to keep him from becomg the Tri-Wizard Tournament champion  Somethg dark is on the loose  Harry must fd out what  is   defeat  befe  is too lateI recommend this book to all Harry  Potter fans  I couldn't put  down  I got the book Saturday afternoon   fished  Sunday night  I can't wa f the next book  the series  to come out- by an 11 year old fan
When I was only five years old I sat wh my father  a darkeng theatre as the openg scroll f The Empire Strikes Back appeared on the screen  some small part of me knew that this was modern mythology  the  makg  F my generation this would be one of our biggest fluences   solvg mal dilemmas learng right from wrong etcetera  The Star Wars  saga is still alive  well among us but the generation on my heels has a  new source of myth   is naturally JK Rowlg  the astoundg  universe she has created f young wizard--trag Harry PotterUpon  fishg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire I can say defively that  Rowlg has done somethg I never would have expected  She has added me  drama  emotional resonance to this already engagg  excg now  middle-aged series  The stakes are higher this time around f Harry   his friends  at the conclusion of the book  seems that they show no  sign of lowerg any time soonI am loathe to give away any of the  trademark shocks  surprises that Rowlg has  ste f the devoted  reader suffice to say that they are just as volvg  head-slappgly  clever as they have always beenAnd as was evident  the last book the  emotional weight of the series is quickly takg hold  There were several  times when Harry  his adventures transcended the mere thrill of readg  a good adventure  I found myself fearg f the safety not of a  character  a book but rather a brave young man who had come to le  right under my nose whout me even noticg  From abject terr to  hearbreakg sadness this reader felt like he was lookg through the same  pair of hnrimmed glasses as the protaganist  And there is somethg to  be said prose-wise f Ms Rowlg's deft use of perspective keepg   efftlessly behd the eyes of Harry even whout ever stretchg the  narrative to first person  I hadn't noticed until about page 600 this time  around but the reason that there's so much suspense  these books is that  almost all of the time (there are a few clever uses of dramatic irony   Book 4) we know only what Harry knowsIn addion Rowlg adds even  me detail to the ridiculously imagative universe of Muggles   Wizardry takg on journalism  professional spts  the Wizard Wld  this time wh unflagggly imagative flairI can't applaud JK  Rowlg  Scholastic Books enough not only f revalizg prt f a  new generation but f also rekdlg the child-like magic side every  generationabout page 600 this time  around but the reason that there's so much suspense  these books is that  almost all of the time (there are a few clever uses of dramatic irony   Book 4) we know only what Harry knowsIn addion Rowlg adds even  me detail to the ridiculously imagative universe of Muggles   Wizardry takg on journalism  professional spts  the Wizard Wld  this time wh unflagggly imagative flairI can't applaud JK  Rowlg  Scholastic Books enough not only f revalizg prt f a  new generation but f also rekdlg the child-like magic side every  generation

After wag one surely thought they might be disappoted but not at all! This book is long but rivetg And  defely is darker than the others although no overly so There are some lovely tie-s wh previous  books some new characters which we hope to see aga  expansion of plot  les  characters It was a whompg good read  alas now we have  another year to wa f the next stallment! A wd to the wise - don't  fsih the last few chapters on a dark stmy night  a house all  alone

Another award to Ms Rowlg f &quotspecial services to the school&quot! This book is excellent  well wth both the wa  the read New  terestg characters add flav to the book yet  doesn't  live up to many of the rums which had been circulatg about  No book  could have lived up to the hype but HP4 makes a good go of  Although  perhaps not que as good a read as the earlier books  brilliantly  accomplishes s purpose - to set the stage f the remag books I  eagerly awa the next book to see how Ms Rowlg concludes the many  clfhangers she left readers wh
It seems unbelievable no one has wrten a review f this because  has been bought faster than they can produce   It is beg bought on the expectation  will live up to the previous books which have rocked  It  is beg bought because of all the hype  Does  live up to this high  expectation?It does!This book is a wner!  The first two chapters  were somethg of a let down (because they are settg the stage f the  sty  the characters are still a ltle one dimensional) but keep on  truckgThe characters start to deepen soon afterwards  the  hijks beg  earnest  The clever ideas that defe the series the  credible gamuts clever twists  thgs that make you laugh out loud  are all here!  Buy this book!You will be saddened but not  disappoted (read to that what you will)
I have Just got done wh this book  got captured  the suspense  mystery  The books have once aga suspended me  time   another universe I would strongly reccomened to people to get this book  read    They will probably enjoy  as much as I did
The newest stallment of the Harry Potter saga is by far the best yet  Startg earlier than all of the pervious novels the events  the early pages of the book lead to the hair-raisg events that occur throughtout  this page-turng novel  I like this one the best because  really shows  Harry at his best: the brave kd  strong hero that graces the covers  JK Rowlg has really outdone herself wh this book I really hope that  the next book comes out soon  you'll see why  you read this book  It  keeps you on the edge of your seat from the openng page to the somewhat  clfhanger endg
&quotWHAT!&quot exclaims Harry &quotNo QUIDDITCH? &quot Well that's exactly right Harry yes you heard Dumbelde crectly But  stead there is somethg much much better Get ready Ladies   Gentelmen announcg the Triwizard Tournament which hasn't taken place   over 100 years! There are hard to believe but yes folks 's true there  are TWO I repeat 2 other schools of Magic: Beauxbatons  Durmstrang  Guess who turns out to be at Beauxbatons none other than a part-veela girl  named Fleur  Quiddch all-star VIkt Krum at Durmstrang Well-guess  who gets chosen f the Hogwarts student(s)? Cedric Diggy  none other  than-HARRY POTTER! But how could he you have to be over 16 to enter?  Read  Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire  fd out!
The sheer size of the book was a ltle timidatg but after readg  I am totally blown away by the tricate  decisive plotles that JK Rowlg can weave  The endg of the book just pulled me   I  was totally absbed  the mayhemed wld of Harry Potter  If you have  read the first three you MUST read this one  even  this is the first  you've heard of Harry Potter(where have you been?) you still must read !
This has been the best book i have ever read! It even proved self to be better than the 3 previous Harry Potter books  There is so much gog on  every character is so well developed Alsoi don't object to the fact  that Rowlg has brought Harry to the dimly l crids of love Like i  saidthis book has everythg!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is easily the best  the Harry Potter series  Harry Hermoe  Ron return f another thrill ride wh Harry  the classic mythic tradion of a hero wh a Quest  In Goblet of Fire  we meet wizards  wches from countries other than Great Bra  We  are troduced to a host of new characters both friends  foes   these characters are as deliciously distct  true-to-le as Rowlg's  previous creations  There are revelations about the pasts of characters we  love  characters we love to hate  Both a beloved friend of Harry's   a servant of &quotYou-Know-Who&quot are present from the begng of  Goblet of Fire The plot's twists  turns are as tidy  unpredictable  as ever  In sht Harry Potter is everythg we have come to love about  the series  me lerally  figuratively  Those 734 pages are  packed full of all the action excement hum  drama of the rest of  the series  Although there are hts at the maturation of the young  heroes they will likely be lost on readers under 11  12  Further the  &quotscary&quot fact has been racheted up a notch makg the book  unsuable f the very young (If you're a reader of Tolkien this can be  compared to the dference between The Hobb  Return of the Kg)  I  will not hesate to let my 9 year old read Goblet of Fire but I will  probably wa a year  two to read  to my not que 6 year old  Still  as an adult reader of the series I devoured the 734 pages  less than two  days as &quotunput-downable&quot as any book I have ever read  I  laughed out loud at Rowlg's hum  cried buckets near the end  One  wd of warng to any who have not read the pri books - many secrets  from books I through III are reviewed  Goblet of Fire so this is one  book that should not be read out of sequence  (The other three need not be  read  sequence)  Otherwise read enjoy  wa another whole year f  Book V!year f  Book V!
The fourth Book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is whout doubt the best out of the Harry Potter Series This 734 page masterpiece is probably one of the best pieces of children's lerature As Harry contues his  adventure  this book he watches the Quiddich Wld Cup is entered to  the Triwizard Tourament  once aga meets Ld Voldermont JK Rowlg  has showed her unbelievable talent once aga You dont want to miss  this
I received Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire yesterday  I read  all the way through to the end (not pausg except when I had to use the restroom  get a glass of water)Needless to say my father didn't appriate me skippg meals  der to fish  I throughly enjoyed this book  which is rare thg to fd  books these days today I was rather sad  about the fact I couldn't eher read the next book  be  the book  livg a part I thk that  might be silly to say what I am about to  seeg how there are so many people agast Harry Potter (tryg to ban the  books) but  I could choose between our wld  theirs I wouldn't have  to even thk befe I replied theirs This book will keep you on your toes  to the very last page I laughed out loud at parts  I cryed at others I  hope the book will let you do the same My last thought is that JK  Rowlg is the best auth that I have ever heard of  she will always be  my fave wrer  I hope she will become yours to
The fourth book of this magical series will capture your imagation  time aga  This book focuses on darker parts of Harry's le  adds some twists wh new  old characters that we all have come to love  Rowlg's love f her characters shows wh their emotions  actions  that are truly like what a kid of that age would do
JK Rowlg has done  aga- taken over our mds thrillg us scarg us  makg us laugh from the the first page of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  carryg over her magic until the last This stallment   the epic sties of our young hero Harry Potter is perhaps the most  spectacular  awe ducg yet Harry havg gone through most of the  summer wh the vile Dursleys get the opptuny to go the the Quiddch  Wld Cup wh Ron  Hermione A fantastic game of Quiddch however is  not all they see One of Voldemt's previous followers has sent up the  Dark Mark- Voldemt's personalized sign callg all of his followers-  'Death Eaters' to him This event is only the first  many that take place   draw Harry to me dangerous suations than he has ever encountered  befe It seems that this particular year the Triwizard Tournament will  take place at Hogwarts This competion tests the skills  bravery of  student from three magic schools- Hogwarts Durmstrang  Beauxbatons  The students to compete are chosen by the mysterious Goblet of Fire which  measures the wth of wizards to partake  the event When the names are  chosen a stunng event takes place- yes 's true- Harry is chosen to  participate  the competion although he never entered his name  was  much too young to compete Bound by the laws of the tournament Harry has  to compete agast the other champions But has Harry simply had some  stroke of luck? Or did someone somethg put Harry's name  the Goblet-  someone who wanted him dead? As the tournament begs startlg  revelations  events take place volvg Hagrid dragons merpeople   perhaps the best of all- Malfoy as a ferret The whole mystery reaches  an tense  hryg climax that will have you clutchg the book   gaspg f breath My advice: Ease the pangs of Harry whdrawal  read  this book If you have never read any of the Harry Potter books then grab  the first one  catch up as fast as you can Any new stallment   Harry's le- particulary this one- is one you DO NOT want to missks then grab  the first one  catch up as fast as you can Any new stallment   Harry's le- particulary this one- is one you DO NOT want to miss
I suppose I ought to state at the outset that I'm a 27-year-old fan of the series  I confess that when I first found out how long this book was gog to be I was a b concerned  In some ways 's easier to wre a long  novel than a sht one  I was afraid that perhaps just perhaps  Rowlg had opted f quickly wrg a me sprawlg book rather than  takg the time to make  tighterI needn't have wriedThis book  is longer yes but  never drags  seems remarkably free of paddg  It has me events takg place  a me tricate plot   sets  the stage f what's to come which I'm lookg fward to readg  Rowlg clearly knows what she's dogUpon fishg page 734 (the day  after startg the book) I closed my eyes hugged the book tightly to my  chest  sighed contentedly  If you liked the first three books you  won't be disappoted
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot may very well be the best  book  JK Rowlg's fast-growg series The expected lim of only  seven books f this fantastic series is almost dissapotg when one  stops to reflect that there are now only three new books to be released   the future I read &quotthe Goblet&quot  less than 24 hours   was enchanted every mute From the very first chapter I was hooked: Ld  Voldemt was back  I was captivated by the idea of a Triwizard Tournament  between Hogwarts School Durmstrang Instute  Beauxbatons Academy   when Harry's name was mysteriously chosen by the Goblet of Fire as a fourth  contender I knew that Harry Potter book #4 was clearly the best of the  bunch The bizarre twists  turns along the chapters had me guessg what  on earth Rowlg would thk of next Just when I though I had  figured  out Cedric Diggy was suddenly killed by Ld Voldemt after he   Harry both grabbed the hles of the Triwizard Cup (which turned out to be  a magic transptation device called a Ptkey leadg the two champions  directly to Ld Voldemt himself!) The book leaves us knowg Voldemt  is back  stronger than  previous encounters JK Rowlg contues to  surprise  astound me  I am posive her next book  the Potter  series will be anythg but dissapotg! I can't wa!
Wow!  What an awesome book!  Mad Eyed-Moody was such a great character  I never suspected him I disliked Krum  Fluer though  HAHA!  You-Know-Who is gog to be embarrassed  He let Harry get away aga! HA!
Muggles f Potter ( f J K Rowlg) will not be disappoted!  Ms Rowlg remas true to her characters troduces plenty of new ones  brgs back some old not to be fgotten ones as well  The ride is well  wth the 700+ pages  When can we expect number 5?
I've been wag f this book ever sce #3 came out  I was thrilled to fd   my mail box yesterday mng  I spent all day readg    didn't disappot  The sty is as engagg as ever   fills  us  on me of Harry  his past  We also fd out me about other  central figures  This book is occasionally rather creepy a nice contrast  to the breezy style Rowlg sometimes employs  I'm 20 years old  I  fd myself gigglg like a 10-year-old over Harry Potter  I know #4 just  came out but I can't wa f the next one!
This book was wth the wa JK Rowlg really outdid herself this time I have to say  this book was great except that at the end  was kd of sad ( I won't ru the book  tell you what happened) It starts  out at Harry's &quothome&quot on privet drive wh his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  his cous Dudley Harry gets an vation from Ron  Weasly (his best friend) to go to the Quiddch wld cup Harry asks his  Uncle Vernon  he says yes (after Harry mentions that his godfather  sirius-who is an nocent man said to be a killer-would be upset  he  doesn't get what he wants) So Harry is of  to the Quiddch wld cup  where somethg really weird ( cool) happens I'm gog to stop here  sce 's not fair to ru the book but read  's BRILLIANT! 
I got Harry Potter 4 on Saturday afternoon  read  through at once Somehow part 4 feels me 'grown-up' than the others  Tempers are risg as puberty is gettg nearer -  also how long can you take beg po   less famous than your friend? And yes 's gettg darker as Rowlg  said herself Someone got killed which made me cry but that is not all  The bad guys are still 100% bad but the good guys are gettg gray rather  than stayg all-whe And who of the good guys will rema loyal? I put  the book down feelg sadder wiser  me grown up than after say  Vol1  2
Wow This book would unquestionably be JK Rowlgs most advanced book The plot is me violent  were I a ltle younger than my 16 years I'd probably be havg nightmares I would suggest anybody who detests long suspense awa the comg of the next novel as this book does leave you  hangg but nearly droolg over the scent of what's to come Wonderful  book!
I thought that this by far was the best book yet  the Harry Potter series  It is deed much me sister than the other books  cludes some me direct episodes wh You-Know-Who  Someone does get killed -  actually me than one person  It is a ltle dferent from the other  books because there is this big competion gog on  so that absbs  everyone  is much me imptant than Harry's relationships wh the  teachers  his classmates although Hermione  Ron are still ma  characters  the sty  There is a great endg wh a few unexpected  twists  I would reccomend this book to any Harry Potter fan - I was hooked   read all of 2 days to fish the 734 pages  this book  Now my  younger sister is so wrapped up   that she couldn't put  down eher!  Trust me these books may seemed hyped up  overpriced but 's wth   because they are really REALLY good!
I love ! The book is great  the suspense WAS SOOOO thrillg! I thk this is the best so far
I just fished readg the book  all I can say iswow! It was really good Her imagation is amazg You feel like you are there I  love Harry!
Excellent!  Maybe the best of the four Ms Rowlgs gets better  better I read the first book because my daughter wanted to read   I wanted to know me about the book first  Usually I just skim new books  f her but I was soon lost  a wld of wizards wches  muggles  We  quickly bought the 2nd  3rd  waed impatiently f the 4th  Can't  wa f the next stallment
First I have to keep tellg myself that this is a kid's book  The sty  the language are surely approachable f a ne year old but I'm 39   astoundedSecond after all the hype surroundg the release I was  prepared to be disappoted  Instead I was entranced  This is a long but  compellg sty   anythg  needed to be longerStill a b  adrt whout a family of his own Harry fds himself  the middle of a  contest he didn't seek  the midst of a battle he didn't start  Confused  about both unsure of his own abily at the lims of his ws   stama he perserveresRowlg looks at friendship  leadership the  elusiveness of truth  courage  The only weak thread  the book is an  abtive explation of slavery  The most amusg thread is a look at a  repter whose sties bear only the fatest resemblence to realy  The  most dficult thread is death  Yes there is death  this sty from  the very first chapter to nearly the end  But  none of the deaths are  whout purpose  even  death good souls fight on agast  evilUltimately the theme of this book is one that every twelve year old  needs to underst:  Wh courage good does conquer evil but sometimes  at a very great price
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a wonderfully constucted book  It can make your spe tgle on one page  you want to cry on the next  The auth has told a great sty of Harry startg to grow up  a way  that can be well-terperted by younger children She was able to clude a  number of thrillg plot les  make them wd together  a superb  way  There are not many  people who can do that well  a children's book  I plan to cherrish the book from now on
This book contues a good styIt was a b long  Imissed the Quiddch matches  Also I could do whout the summariesfrom past booksBUT----the sty surprised me aga  some great sub sties  made me cry about 5 times The new magic that Harry does is great  I also enjoyed their &quotRomances&quotI am lookg fward to the next one
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire lives up to the promise of the three precedg books  Rowlg keeps her fans happy by buildg on popular themes from the last three books (Quddch Harry's rivalry wh Malfoy  Hagrid's love of dangerous creatures ect) while troducg new  characters  themes that will (most likely) be imptant  later books  While I enjoyed this book very much be fwarned that  is deed darker  than the other books  the series  may not be appropriate f very  young children
As we all know the Harry Potter series is very popular among adulsts The themes style  characters have been strong enough to make me a commted fan On rare occasions however there were aspects that remded me that the the books were wrten f adolescents Some suations were a  ltle too contrived some m characters were too far over the top   so fthI am glad to rept that the latest Potter is almost entirely  free of these &quotcrge&quot elements Whout losg any consistency  from previous volumes the Harry Potter wld has settled down  is - f  lack of a better term - less self absbedAnd 's a good thg too  because thgs are gettg serious now!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best novel yet  the series!  Rowlg's feshadowg  clever plot development are once aga excelent  the clever  excg fourth novel !  I couldn't put  down! It is a must-read book f all age groups!
THis book was by far the best JK has ever wrten  Even though  was long  was easy to underst  we all got the message she was sendg through  In all of her books she made  seem like you were there but   this one you could actually SEE Harry's name flyg out of the Goblet of  Fire  you could feel how Harry felt so deeply about missg a parent  figure  This book made us realize the values of our le   was a  plane to adventure f kids  adults
After fty mutes of fightg a large overly exced cloaked  costumed crowd of young Harry Potter fans  their parents Friday night at midnight I fally had my copy of the latest Potter sty!  My md was  reelg wh the same questions  What would Harry do?  Who would be the  new Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher? How can I someday be as wise as  Albus Dumblede? Would Hermione sce seven hundred percent on every test?  But the femost question  my md was &quotcould Jo Rowlg live up to  the wonderful qualy of wrg  stytellg that is her first three  books  the series?&quot  Let me tell you she did  In my opion the  content the seamless plot  the amazgly developed characters combe  f the best book of the series  not the best book of the year so far  I will give away none of the plot but rest assured this is the best  Potter book yet  I have friends who were wried about the length of the  book  I fished the 700 plus pages  a ltle over 36 hours  The  wrg is so wonderfully concise  the sty so trigug you hardly  notice the length of the book  Jo Rowlg proves herself a seer a bn  styteller  a champion of imagation  One terestg aspect of the  series is that the characters grow up as they go along  They experience  me mature emotions me tests on their mals  their problems become  me serious the older they get  The fourth book seems to have lost some  of the puerily of the first three however as much as we would like to  we can't keep Harry Hermione Ron  company young fever  If you have  any vacillation whatsoever about buyg the book due to the slightly higher  cover price  the length abon   purchase this book immediately!  The only regret you will have about Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  that  was over much too soon
Just fished this book--could not put  down  Per usual Rowlg does a great job of detailg the s  outs of Hogwarts but  this stallment she gives a broader view of the larger wizardg wld  The  plot moves quickly wh the expected twists  turns buildg up to a  great showdown  denouement  It's fabulous!

First of all   you've never read any of the other Harry Potter books go back  start readg from the begng  This book depends upon the reader beg at least moderately familiar wh Harry Potter  Hogwarts&quotGoblet of Fire&quot is a larger book than the first threef a  good reason  This book substantially develops ongog plot threads from  pri books  creates new twists  turns to delight puzzle  amaze  the readerHarry Potter arrives at Hogwarts expectg a  &quottypical&quot fourth-year school experience  Even befe he reaches  school he fds that his fourth year at Hogwarts is to be anythg but  typical  Harry is mistakenly thrust to an ter-school competion  between Hogwarts  s French  German counterparts (Beauxbatons   Durmstrang)  What starts out as a seemgly nocent contest soon takes on  a me sister tone leadg to a shatterg climax that soon proves to be  the begng of yet another saga  Harry Potter's leThis volume  really starts to &quotflesh out&quot the Harry Potter Universe's histy  We learn me about Sirius Black Headmaster Dumblede Hagrid  Ld  Voldemt  Romance touches Harry's le although this is only one aspect  of an credibly complex novel  Several new characters are troduced   I look fward to seeg how they develop  future stallmentsWhout  givg away any of the plot secrets 's safe to say that this the fourth  ( middle) book of the seven-book series sets up the reader f an  credible series of events to be revealed  remag volumes  The most  dficult thg about this book (other than my hs gettg tired - 's  HEAVY) was tryg to put  downOne m note of caution to parents   teachers: this is the most serious book  the series so far  The  sty's tone is much darker  scarier than I had expected This isn't a  reason to avoid the book  just be aware that parts may not be suable  f late-night readg to very young children  I would have no problem  readg any part of this book to young children durg daylight hours  howeverThis book will require multiple readgs  re-readgs to  fully appreciate the depth of the characters  universe that J K  Rowlg has created  I predict that kids ( adults) will re-read this  book me than the first three volumes put togetherI am amazed   thrilled at the latest Harry Potter adventure  am only upset that 's  gog to take another year ( me?) befe the next volume is released!may not be suable  f late-night readg to very young children  I would have no problem  readg any part of this book to young children durg daylight hours  howeverThis book will require multiple readgs  re-readgs to  fully appreciate the depth of the characters  universe that J K  Rowlg has created  I predict that kids ( adults) will re-read this  book me than the first three volumes put togetherI am amazed   thrilled at the latest Harry Potter adventure  am only upset that 's  gog to take another year ( me?) befe the next volume is released!
The Goblet of Fire contues to hold the reader until the last page  The creased size (700+ pgs) allows f me volved sty les  The plots are not hard to follow as this is still a book targeted f children  I  strongly recommend this series to people of all ages  Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire is the perfect book to curl up wh
This is an excellent book  my opion  is the best  theseries so far I started readg  the day  came out  icoulden't put  down  Wh 1 night i was half way through the book I won't give away the endg f anyone who hasen't read this book All I have to say is that I believe JK Rowlg has outdone herself
J K Rowlg has done  aga  I bought the book the day  came out  was unable to put  down until I fished  the same day  Once aga I was pulled to the wld of Hogwarts School  the le of Harry   his friends  The challenges that Harry Potter faces on the quest to become  school champion kept me on the edge of my seat wonderg what would happen  next  as always I left the book a better person as a read about fair  play team wk  true friendship  The end of the book left me eager  f me  I can't wa f the next book to be published The fourth  Harry Potter book defiantly lives up to the stards of the previous three   to me even exceeds them
This book was very well wrten Some people thk  focuses on Wch Craft  Wizardy but I thk This book rocks
As a children's librarian I can honestly say I'm grateful f JK Rowlg  her wonderful creation What other auth could spire children to anxiously awa the publication of a 700 page book? This fourth  stallment was wth wag f  will not disappot fans of the  series Rowlg's great descriptions of characters  compellg action  make  still a rapid read despe 's size Highly recommended to all  Harry fans as well as to those who should be
This books was one of JK Rowlgs best  my opion  All the detatils connectg the books lived on  a pleasent way  The climax was action-packed as usual yet wh a depressg out come The  &quotcasualty&quot is of a person of imptance but  is not any of  the &quotmost imptant people&quot I reccomend  to anyone who has  read the previous books
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire will keep you readg  readg  readg  You will fd that 734 pages is not enough This book moves quickly contues to exp the characters  places of the wizardg wld  leaves you wantg me  Hurry up wh number 5
I've read up to chapter 27  already I thk this is the best of the four  In his fourth year Harry learns much about friendships  house-elves  There is yet another Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher  along wh a whole cast of new  excg charters  I haven't put the  book down sce yesterday when I got   This is defely the best!
The other Harry Potter books were really great--but this one just tops  off  People who like to be frightened by what they read will love the endg:   is about as scary as all the other books put together  In book 4 there is the death of a Hogwarts student but Harry also fally fds  love  F everyone who loves a long read this is the book f you It is  734 pages of pure enjoyment
This is a tough one just because I don't want to ru the book f any of you by sayg anythg    Me of the same but  this case  really is MORE of the same only darker thicker  my oh my how all those ltle  details from previous books you thought didn't matter pop up  the most  unexpected places (Though I'm sure you can already guess who Harry starts  payg attention to sce she caught his eye  book three)My only  recommendation to readers who have not picked  up yet would be to get the  UK/Canadian edion rather than the US edion so you can have   the  igalSce the begng of the series the eds  the US chose  to &quotsave&quot American readers from &quotdficult&quot Brish  terms  expressions -- though changg the tle from &quotPhilosopher's  Stone&quot (as 's known  the wld outside of the US) to  &quotScerer's Stone&quot is unfgiveableNevertheless     regardless whether your book reads &quotbogey&quot  &quotbooger&quot  you'll be bound to be pleased by this follow-upEnjoy your summer  readg!
Book came out July 8  I read the entire thg immediately!  I really enjoyed this book  was amazed at s length (700+ pages)  However as usual she has left me hangg at the end  I am frustrated because now I  have to wa f the next one?  ANy chance  is beg published this week?
This is an amazg tome wh me action  hr than any Potter book befe  And 's huge --  doesn't even seem like a childrens' book I'm not a kid but I've been readg  almost nonstop f the last 10 hours  seems like the action never slows down  that has been keepg  me from puttg  down I won't reveal too much but lets just say that  this volume is very dark this is not the stuff of books from my  childhood even the scary ones (such as I know what you did last summer)  Nevertheless any kid who reads  cover to cover will be generally better  off f the rich readg experience
JK Rowlg has done  once aga This book is just as wonderful as the other three  The sty is magnicent  I was not able to put the book down  I wont give away the sty but I strongly recommend this book f  people of all ages fact would I have been alowed I would have given   me than five stars  this book has every b of the magic of the first  three but wh a br new plot to enjoy  Children  adults of all ages  will love this book!
this much anticipated fourth book really does live up to the hype  although much longer than the previous books  really kept my son  i both rapt wh excement  i would recommend  to any harry potter fan  defely read the first three books befe this one  though
Greatest book  the series yet Longer but me tense  gratyg
J K Rowlg has done  aga  She has wrten a book that has suspense mystery romance hr  entertament throughout  When I got my copy I couldn't put  down  I can't wa f the next one
At 12:01 AM July 8th my family was stg  le f the first released Harry Potter IV books  Tulsa  My 11 year old had read the entire 700 pages by the next day  I myself stayed awake till 4:00 AM to read So get plenty of sleep befe readg this book You won't sleep  until you fishAnd you might not sleep well afterwards eher  Because unlike the first 3 Harry Potter books this one contas at least  one very dark  hrid sceneHarry is tied to Voldemt's father's  tomb while Voldemt perfms a bloody rual  A fellow student  friend  is killed although not (thank God) by human sacriceBut  this scene  is necessary   is then  is wrten wh the proper disgust   hr which should accompany Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  shares the strengths of the earlier books  the series  The secret  villian is a surprise the characters are real the plot is believable  It  has some addional virtues  It is long but never bg The buddg  romances are not cliched yet leave the plot unclutteredThe twists of  characterization contue  crease  At least one hateful character is  beautully redeemed  a few good characters display questionable  tendenciesTwo m characters display subtle depth One man brgs  srow on himself  his family by fgettg maly  his fight  agast evil  Another desires comft  familiary too greatly  so  ignes plaly displayed evilThe Globlet of Fire is not a stalone  book  Like Tolkien's &quotThe Two Towers&quot  is neher the first  n the last  the series to readI will be  le at 12:01 AM wag  f next Harry Potter stallment
As all Harry Potter fans know we had to wa alooooooooooooooooong time f this bookIt was wth I'm notgog to spoil this book f anyone by givg away any plot pots but I'll say his Harry Potter IV was funny sad suspenseful full of adventure  at some pots you will be VERY suprised this book was simply AMAZING!I don't see how J K  Rowlg could have done any better!
JK Rowlg does  aga--the same fe descriptive prose excg action amazg monsters page-turng climax  of course a gentle lesson at the endAs you all know someone does deed die but 's not  who you expect  As usual someone close to Harry attempts to hurt him   as usual 's not who you expect And wh the nasty turn of events near  the end you might expect the tone to become dark  It remas hopeful   courageous to the fishThe gratyg thg about this series is that   keeps gettg better--you won't be disappoted  Goblet of Fire   fact you'll be glad that 's almost 750 pages so  will last at least a  few under-the-sheets-wh-the-flashlight nightsHow long do we have to  wa f the next one?
When I fally had book four  my hs I felt exhilarated--this Ulysses of a novel should keep me enthralled f a few days  But when I put down the book f the night I turned my light on ten mutes later because I  HAD to fish the book  From the first page this volume of Harry's le  possesses a dferent tone but soon we are &quotapparated&quot back to  the &quotnmal&quot le of Harry Potter--the le of the Dursleys  quiddch  Ron  Hermione  But not whout so many questions:  why  does Harry's scar hurt? what should the students of Hogwarts be exced  about the upcomg term? why so many thoughts about death? The readers of  the previous three volumes will be surprised wh all the new characters  cludg the Defense Agast Dark Arts profess who is as mysterious as  his predecesss  We also meet wizards  soon-to-be-wizards from ls  far away when they all arrive to compete  the Triwizard Tournament  As  well as meetg these characters we learn me about the characters we  thought we knew so timately--cludg Hagrid Neville  Dumblede  Rowlg contues to surprise her readers wh plot-twists  revelations  I fm my own opions  predictions about how the novel will end   I'm never right! Like a great hr/who-dunn movie she keeps you  guessg  when you thk you have  all figured out she reveals the  truth--all of which she has been alludg to  droppg hts but done  so  such a clever manner  This novel isn't as psychological as the  others  the series but  is just as wonderful  Rowlg as well as  describg the magical so beautully also shows how confused  fourteen-year-olds can be when our fave triumvirate attends the Yule  Ball  Harry defeated He-Who-Cannot-Be-Named but can he ask a girl out?  JK Rowlg created a ptkey when she wrote her Harry Potter novels  All  I can say is when will the fth volume be published?
Well I must start this review by sayg that I am not 9  even 12  I am a twenty-seven year old who recently returned to grad schoolI started Year 4 on Saturday mng  I read almost non-stop all day long  lerally glued to the book (resentg any of the banal trivialies of  le--ie food commments etc that took me away from ) until at 9:30  pm Saturday night I reached the rivetg last pageIn my opion this  is the best book of the series (I recently re-read books 1-3 to rega a  sense of contuy) Rowlg contues to grow  develop the  characters--Hermione becomes an object of desire f both new  old  characters Harry  Ron struggle wh the awkwardness of growg boys to  develop new relationships wh girls  to deal wh the expression of  their feelgs f the girls around them  Fred  Gege beg to prepare  f le after Hogwarts  a way which provides a lot of fun  amusement  Draco Malfoy gets a come-uppance  one of the funniest ways impossible (I  laughed out loud delightedly)In this book Harry Potter struggles wh  his fame--he almost loses friendships because of   he has to deal  wh the vicious press  He encounters an unscrupulous repter who  attempts to destroy both his reputation  the reputations of others close  to himOf course Voldemt is aga back tryg to rega power  The  whole book has a sister undertone because of the question about who   Hogwarts  helpg him  The clues are sparse so the reader is left wh a  sense of dreadThis book does conta death but the impact of the  death is migated by Harry's nobleness  dealg wh The best part  of this book is that  leaves me hungerg f another Late developments   the book wh Cnelius Fudge  Severus Snape leave plenty of chaos to  be mopped  the next book  In fact at the end of book four the future  looks very bleak f good wizards  wchesLike the others the rich  description  hum of the book as well as the real-le parallels make  the place  time come alive Hagrid Dumblede the Weasleys Sirius  Black  all our other faves are back better than everLike the others the rich  description  hum of the book as well as the real-le parallels make  the place  time come alive Hagrid Dumblede the Weasleys Sirius  Black  all our other faves are back better than ever
i loved this book all of the harry potter books were credible  these books really show harry growg up so as beg that age i can relate to them  i read the whole series cludg the fourth one  three days  s credible the way these books just capture you i couldnt stop readg  them
I gave this book five stars because of the wrer good plot  the way she explaned everythg  the book  I am not gog to tell about the sty much because I don't like spoilg stuff but  was a very good book  I recommend you readg the first three befe this one
Great style the characters are well-developed   my opionion this book is the least &quotscary&quot out of all the Harry Potter series  The play-by-play of the Wld Cup game  the book was a ltle  bg  some of the wds  the book were a ltle advanced f young  readers  Overall a must read  a great book!
Another terfic book  the Harry Potter series  Even at over 700 pages this one will leave you longg f me  As Harry Potter grows so does Rowlg's narrative style  This book -- like s hero -- seems much me grown up than the others both  themes  narrative style  Yet 's  still an adventure that all ages can enjoy wh moments of thrillg  action tense danger  deep pathosThe auth has a really good feel  f what 's like to be a buddg teenager -- even a teenager at a  boardg school f wizardsWe get to see students from other schools   this one -- which lends a larger dimension to the tale  The relationships  between the cast members become me complex as well  Wh much of her  background established Rowlg feels free to delve to her wld me  fullyI've read ( wked on) fantasy books  games f 20 years  but Rowlg's wld still feels fresh  excg to me  I can hardly  wa f the next oneStg Hats off to this marvelous auth!  Who  else could make a 700 page novel read like a 200 page book?
this was really a great bookeven better than the last three i read   about three hours  already i cant wa f the next one btw does anyone know when thats comg out?  o well I guess I will just have to wa f  I would give everythg about this book five stars except f  the relationship hermione &lt&ltdid i mention that this book fally says  how to pronounce her name? Its her-my-oh-nee Ive been sayg  wrong the  whole time&gt&gt except f the relationship hermione has wh vikt  krum  just doesnt seem believable---but i will say no me because i  dont want to give away the book except powerfulpowerful endg that was  easily the best part of the whole sty that leaves the reader wh a  feelg of anticipation  febodg about whats gog to happen next  -oh yes- someone did die  this book but  was not as I  thought&lt&ltmy friends  I were takg bets on who would be cut-out  our guesses go from everyone from dumblede to nevilles toad but none of  us expected this&gt&gt well i really cant wre any me because you will  be mad at me f rug the book f you so just go read 
&quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot arrived on my dostep on Saturday   took a day to plow through the (immense!) book  Rowlg's wrg is very entertag  I really wish the next three were already  availableOverall I say this book is defely on par wh Rowlg's  previous three chronicles of Harry's years at Hogwart's  The  characterization details  plot are very enjoyable  entertag   previous readers will feel right at home wh this latest  bookAlthough Azkaban is my fave so far (I love the endg!)  Goblet of Fire is defely  the runng f my fave year  The  endg was VERY dramatic  excg  a clf-hanger  someways  This book really sets up the next three years well  we can be sure the  excement is just begng!
This book was wonderful I bought the book at 8:00  the mng which was the earilest time you could get   I read  all day I stayed up till 4:00 to fish    a way I am sad  is over This book chances you  has every thg that a novel should have hum action suspence   a ltle b a romance These books just keep gettg better I have  nothg but fantastic thgs to say about this book
This is the much-anticipated book that had me wag  leat midnight to buy even wh my onle der pendg   waswth every mute of the wag  wonderg ( hyper-active media coverage) I flipped pages all weekend long tn between makg  last  rippg through   Well as evidenced by this review my impatient side won out  I read  all  a weekend!I enjoyed this book immensely --  felt like two books  one I am so impressed wh the auth f not holdg back  tryg to squeeze two books out of this one -- the hard wk put to this huge tome showsUnlike her first three books this one does not start on Harry's birthday Instead  starts out wh a very dark  scary scene  the murder of a Muggle I liked the fact that this book did not follow the same &quotfmula&quot as the previous three Yes 's pretty dark  scary but the suspense  surprises are thgs I've come to enjoy  appreciate about these books What a great twist endg!The Quiddch Wld Cup is imagative --  as an American I enjoyed the &quotternational&quot feel to this part of the book Rowlg opens our eyes to every other part of the wlds -- both her Muggle  Wizard wlds The mascot  souvenir descriptions are wonderful  so imagative You feel like you're there beside Harry Ron  Hermione drkg the scene I was afraid the house-elf &quotanti-slavery&quot campaign would turn preachy but there was a nice touch (light-hed really) on a potentially controversial topic Long live SPEW! :) I also wondered  the Ra Skeeter commentary was about the over-active media but I laughed  cheered wh the characters at  all  Great touchesI also enjoyed how Rowlg wked  the pronunciation of Hermione's name -- Her-my-oh-nee Hoay!

Rowlg did  aga  Bestbook i ever read!
I began readg the fourth Harry Potter as soon as FedEx delivered  Saturday mng  didn't put  down until 2:00 am Sunday mngExcellent!  The best Potter by far  Aga wonderfully drawn  characters exceptional descriptive wrg superb plot twists   despe publicy befe release surprises gale  I am a mother of  three but I have made  a practice to read the Potter books befe my  son who is 11 so we can discuss them  I can answer questions  I have  found that I enjoy them as much( maybe me) than he does  I can hardly  wa f number 5 to see what happens next!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is fally here!  This latest stallment contas the same excement hum danger   wonderfully ventive imagation as the precedg Harry Potter books  Harry Potter fans will not be disappoted  JK Rowg has managed to  once aga entrance us  a wonderful adventure  Parents of younger  readers should be warned:  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  is darker  scarier than any of the other books  I would advise parents  to at least skim some of the later chapters befe allowg their children  to read them  I personally feel that none of this is too dark   frighteng f young readers The themes of hon friendship  bravery  are still idolized  However parents should be aware of the darker  contents of this book  It is hard f readers not to be disappoted   later books  series  Many series seem to loose their magic as they go  along  Readers have high expectations that books often do not live up to  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is as exhilaratg   wonderful as any of the earlier books  F me the only disappotment is  havg to wa another year to read Harry's further adventures
True to the previous Harry Potter novels this newest efft is fast paced fun While darker  tone  is as enjoyable as the Prisoner of Azkaban which  my opion was the best  the series Rowlg brgs  many new  aspects  details to the sty which make  seem fresh stead of just  rehashed The one drawback  is really long f children yet I thk  very much wth the time
The gang is back   top fm  750 Pages fly by  one does not notice that  is longer  Rowlgs contues to keep the reader enthralled wh m ltle climaxes on every other page  the fal pnacle is as  surprisg as ever  I f one enjoy gettg a chance to solve a riddle  much like the logic problem  the first bookAs an adult I enjoy the  simplicy of fallg to a consistent universe of imagation   escapism  I haven't found any 'deeper' meang like Alice  Wonderl  Rowlgs keeps her pots out  the open - the power of friendship the  benef of cooperation the traps of bias  prejudice  overall good  over evilThe cheatg  nasty rudeness seems me evident than ever  It's a lesson that brgs me up sht on recommendg this sty to those  kids who might be approachg their first youth book  The size may  timidate them hopefully  But f older kids which fd this tame to the  realy of school le today - 's great escapism
I am a big Harry Potter fan  have read all 4 books Each of them were great but this one was the best yet It had a perfect balance of danger  fun In each book Miss Rowlg develops the characters me  me None  of the characters seem to only to only one dimensional I love the way she  makes all the characters seem human She is a wonderful wrer  will go  down  histy wh the greats like Mark Twa  Jules Verne
In my opion this is one of the greatest books that I have read sce Greg Rucka's &quotBatman:  No Man's L&quotI read the entire thg  one day  It has wonderful new ideas that prove  there was any doubt  about  still that JK Rowlgs is a very gted auth  that we  should be proud to be able to read her wkThis is a wonderful book   I just hope that everyone else will someday realize that  I f one  cannot wa until the 5th book comes outWh this book I became so  volved wh  that I even started cryg at one pot  I also laughed  out loud at other times  This is not just a children's book  This a book  f everyone  I just wish that thgs like those  her book really did  exist
This book is very good Everyone should read  even though these people at amazoncom rated  only good f people that were 9-12 years old The Washgton Post said  was good f people of all ages which I strongly  believe  Anyways this book has good content Thanks f readg my book  review
The book was the best yet It always kept takg unexpected turns The only thg I didn't like was the no terhouse Quiddch tournament
This was a very enjoyable book  I thk  far exceeds her other three  qualy of wrg  the style  The length just flies by because the entire book is filled wh action  dilemmas  of course Harry Potter rises to meet each one  I could hardly put the book down  was sad when  I came to the last page  It has an endg that leaves you hangg  I  can't wa until the fth one comes out  If you are the parent of a young  child I suggest readg the book along wh them  befe they do because  the book deals wh some very heavy issues that parents might want to  address wh their children  I do not thk that the issues distract from  the sty but rather add to   Children however may become upset   they are unable to talk to someone about their feelgs  This is a  wonderful sty  I would reccomend  to anyone
Stupendous  That's the only wd f   The long awaed sequel to the first three Harry Potter books has at last arrived   was well wth the hype 37 chapters long there is a furious pace throughtout wh clues   red herrgs everywhere as Harry is drawn closer to a web of  trigue  evil Harry's scar is playg him up as he is plagued by  strange dreams -  are they dreams?  Fred  Gege are up to somethg   Hermione has started a campaign  Profess Trelawney is predictg  death left right  centre Malfoy is beg hrible  fact thgs seem  pretty nmal at Hogwarts  But away from school a series of bizarre  events  unexplaed disappearances are leadg danger closer to  Hogwarts  to Harry The atmosphere is one of unease - despe the  humour this is a dark sty but  a league above even the first three  books  There are many new characters  the length allows the existg  characters to be better developed  The plot is complicated  always  unexpected  The book reaches a chillg climax as Harry faces the  greatest deal of his le -  a tragedy occurs that will leave the  stoniest hearted of readers  tears  But be warned - just when you thk  the excement is over the wst is still to come  The endg is not a  satisfacty one - so much is yet to come!

This book was very dark much darker  scarier than any of the other three  I would not recommend readg  to young children especially befe bed  It put much me emphasis on Voldemt's old suppters the  Death Eaters than ever befe  We fd out who they were wh some  surprises  how some of them got out of gog to Azkaban  Many fd  themselves  an awkward posion when Voldemt is on the rise aga  The  first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemt  Harry is not metioned at  all  Secondly there were deaths  this book one which is a student at  Hogwarts  Through this book we come to better underst the suation  befe Voldemt's downfall the terr the chaos  the uncertaty of  not knowg who was on your side  who was really supptg the Dark  Ld But despe  perhaps because of that this book is  my  opion the best  the series  It is certaly the longest at 700+ pages   There is lots of laughs lots of venture  lots of hilarious  attempts at romance  Its not too mushy though don't wry  Its not all  dark  scary though  Harry goes to the Quiddich Wld Cup wh the  Weasleys he  Ron have an terestg time fdg dates f the Yule  Ball He Ron  Hermione have happy times hangg out  the common room   there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred  Gege Weasley   There are lots of funny new characters too  An extremely paranoid new  Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher an annoygly nosy Daily Prophet  repter students from the other two school f Wizardry   Europe-Beaubaxtons  Durmstrang  a Wld Cup Quiddch player  love  wh Hermione I laughed out loud many times while readg this bookNo  book is perfect  though these are great I have a few problems  First of  all does everybody have a secret they never tell Harry? It always seems  that he  we are always the last to know  Why does Harry get  everythg?  In thisbook he gets to be the second champion from Hogwarts   compete  the Triwizard Tournement  He ws everythg  sometimes  I just want him to lose f a change  F this reason I was actually  rootg partialy f Cedric Diggy  the tournement  What is up wh  Vikt Krum suddenly beg  love wh Hermione  I don't underst    Nothg agast Hermione but she isn't breathlessly ggeous  Vikt Krum  is about eighteen  she is fourteen thats kd of sick  Then on top of  that Cedric Diggy is  love wh Cho Chang who is also much younger  than his is  Is this just the way wizards are?But all  all this was  a great book that everyone should defately read!

This is the best Harry Potter book ever!  Every sgle page was full of excement even the first few chapters which are usuallynot so great considerg they are just about Harry  the cruel Dursleys Anyway Harry  is  a competion that hasn't taken place f a hundred years due to too  many casualties Now once aga Harry must battle evil This book was  great!

I'll adm that when my friend first hed me Harry Potter  the Scerer's Stone to read i was a b of a skeptic But i was hooked on the series after the first paragraph I've read a lot of books but this is the only series that has ever gotten me to read through 734 pages  less than  one day!  This is defely the best book  the series  considerg  that he's growg up  all I'm sure they'll keep gettg even better I  recommend this book f anyone even  you don't like to read  you can't  s still f two seconds Read  you won't regret !
I fished readg this book last night  while I can say  all honesty that I LOVED the first three books this one left a very bad taste  my mouth  The character developement is still good the sty le is a  contuation of the other three books  she did a good job of makg the  three ma characters seem older  However havg let my 9 year old  daughter read the first three on her own there is no way I can let her  read this one by herself  The cruelty  this one as well as the graphic  description of a self mutilation  the thly disguised comparison of  the The Dark One's followers  Nazi's make me really hesate to let her  read this one on her own  The first three books were nocent this one is  defely not

This good combed fresh new ideas wh recollections of the previous sty  Thee bood fufilled my want to read on wh out an abrupt stop  Many abrupt plot changes at the end brought ideas fth I had not imaged  I can't wa to read the book f a second time
This is the longest  most &quotgrown-up&quot Harry Potter book yet but  loses nothg from the magic we have come to expect of s auth It reads fast  well New characters jo the cast some evil some good  all fascatg Harry  Ron discover girls  Hermione gets discovered  by boys It seems that teen age is dawng  the magic is gettg me  complex I especially liked the lesson on the Defense Agast the Dark Arts  course where Harry is fightg off a &quotfbidden&quot curse that  controls his md Evil magic is defeated by strength of will- I bet Harry  can teach a few thgs on how to fight drugs  peer pressure  JK  Rowlgs wields her own magic w wh a sure h It is impressive how  she can make us grieve f Harry's lost parents time  time aga This  book also ends on a shockgly grim note: The evil side is up  the good  side is lickg new wounds Still all characters rema fully developped  resonatg wh both magic  humany  I especially appreciate the  manner  which she brgs all aspects of human nature to play  attributes them to dferent characters  weaves them tightly to the  plot Yetthe auth never preaches never assumes a condescendg tone  She won't underestimate our telligence whether we be children  adultsThis book (like the others befe ) represents creative telligent  wrg of high caliberOnly one question remas: Do we really have to  wa another year f Harry Potter book 5? How about usg that owl post  f a change!
_Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire_ is the best of Rowlg's books yet  In readg the series I have enjoyed watchg Harry  his friends grow  deal wh me complicated suations both among themselves   agast the fces of the evil Voldemt  Now wh the fourth book  Rowlg pulls out all stops  Not only do the young characters contue to  develop (both as typical teens  as magic-users) not only is the plot  richly layered  full of Rowlg's characteristic misdirection not only  is there me action than fty Quiddch matches but the 700+ page book  never lags as detail after imagative detail is produced makg the wld  of Harry Potter even me vivid to the readerRowlg promised that this  book would be darker than befe  she wasn't kiddg  Nasty thgs  happen  people die cludg imptant ones  Betrayal can come from  any direction  Harry discovers that people supposedly on the same side can  disagree profoundly to the pot of losg one's advantageThe ma  plotle of the book is neatly wrapped up wh the end of the school year  but Rowlg leaves so many opengs f the next book that there is bound  to be another Harry-watch f book 5 befe the dust settles on the current  stampede  And  book 5 is anythg like book 4  will be just as wth  the wa
This book provides all that anyone could ask -- adventure fun  mystery The book resumes the adventures of Harry Potter  his zany friends at his Wchcraft schoool  I don't want to spoil any of  so I  won't reveal any details  Trust me: you're  f an adventure -- a really  great adventure
Well f those that haven't read  I won't spoil a thg  But the tnament f the Goblet of Fire was totally cool! In this book Harry is faced wh many challenges  overcomes many obsticals Also he gets to  go to the Qutich Wld Cup which was phat! There are many twists   turns  this book  as my brother predicted someone dies He was a  cool guy too! But n e wayz I would recommend this book to anybody over the  ages of 13  so Because any younger  teh content my go over their  heads
I went to readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire wh altle apprehension I thought that wh all the publicy HarryPotter might have grown to be a ltle dferent not as charmg  just pla dumb  However Ms JK Rowlg has kept the sty just as rivetg as  was  the first three books  Harry Potter is still Harry Potter There were only a few thgs wh this book that rather annoyed me but they were small  didn't detract from the novelFirst of all 's dictionary-sized As well Harry does not actually get to Hogwarts until about 175 pages to  It really didn't matter though because he was wh Ron's family at the Quiddch Wld Cup There are also two chapters about the Yule Ball  the middle that I thought lagged a b but other than that this novel was full steam ahead the entire way throughThe book has a great plot as usual  the endg wraps thgs up perfectly  This book is defely just as good  not better than the other three novels  this series Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a great read  will keep most kids happy f a month based on s size Of course wh the older kids like me 'll only keep us busy f a couple of days  But of course we'll read  aga because the Harry Potter books are all better the second time aroundnyias
This book is most undoubtedly the best book  the Harry Potter series so far  I read  f 2 days straight until I fished I couldn't put  down!  It was VERY suspenseful  at some parts pretty creepy  The book  was better than I thought  was gog to be  believe me I thought   was gonna be pretty good  When I first got  I was blown away at how  credibly large  was but the length gave  a THICKER (hehe) plot   me description  It was a superb book wh a very unexpected twist at the  end  GREAT BOOK!
This book as are all of the Harry Potter books was excellent JK Rowlg is a wonderful fantasy auth Extremely suspenseful  dramatic  kept me guessg all the time It was kd of freaky/scary  there was  a lot me  there about the Dark Arts than  her other books I had not  really expected that The wrg didn't really f wh the rest of the  series-- was much me of a dramatic adventure sty than a fun-filled  entertag fantasy like the other ones were I however still enjoyed   immensely  cannot wa f the fth one  the seriesHow anyone  could want to ban her wrg is beyond me Her wrg is fantasy  her  readers are que aware of that The messages  her books about Magic are  not violent  are really not wth the fuss  complats that people  are puttg up about them Fiction  fantasy are wrten f a reason:  f entertament People who read fantasy know that I really enjoy her  wrg  I wish people would be me sensible about lature
This book was simply AWESOME Miss Rowlg kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time She did another unbelievable job Despe the large number of pages I fished the book  two days Reader should be aware that this  book is highly addictive I know that I'll be readg this a couple me  times befe I put  down!Jo Harry now 14  his adventures wh  his two best friends Ron  Hermione As the mystery unfolds you'll fd  me  me characters volved as Miss Rowlg weaves an tricate web  of confusion desperation  excement As nothg me can be said  whout rug the surprises I'll leave you wh two wds: constant  vigilance
OK so I'm not 10 but I still love Harry Potter!  I could not but this book down all weekend  It is defely the best of the series  I love the ltle imagive touches throughout the book (Especially Omnioculars!) I wish I wasn't a Muggle because I would love to go to  Hogwarts
AmazgastonishgJK Rowlg's done  aga wh this over-the-top book  Couldn't put  down!
Muggles  wizards alike will love the new episode of Harry PotterThe action is better than ever Our old faves are back And best of all the whole book moves along at a great clip wh even me to loveRowlg's  style of wrg a good book whout regard f age of readers makes this a  great book that is loved by children but never talks &quotdown&quot to  kids At the same time this tale will keep adults up readg all  nightOne of the best ways f families to enjoy this book is to read   aloud  let the whole family enjoy  togetherSo put on your best  wizard robes send an owl to your friends tellg them not to disturb you   revel  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot
WOW! I have never read 700+ pages faster  enjoyed them me I don't want to spoil the book f anyone who hasn't read  so I'll just stick to the generalThis book is amazg I didn't thk  could get any  better than Azkaban but I have to say that Goblet is just as excg   emotionally charged as the last although Rowlg wasn't kiddg when she  said that the series would get darker Still anythg less serious would  compromise the tegry of the characters who are ptrayed as real  people  spe of their magical abiliesTopics  suations are  gettg me mature  therefe deeper  the relationship between  Hermione Harry  Ron is shown  much greater detail The pasts of  Hagrid  Snape are exposed There is a very terestg Defense Agast  the Dark Arts teacherto say me would be givg too much awayRead   f yourself  you'll underst
I thought that the fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series was by far the greatest  I read   two days startg the day  came out  fishg  the next day  I thought that the auth combed tragedy  suspense love  hum very well wh a completely unexpected twist f  the endg  I didn't stop readg  from the mute I got !  I dare  you just try to resist the temptation of the Harry Potter Journeys (spells  don't wk)!
WOW!  This book is fantastic  Great f kids of all ages    I cannot believe that I have already come to the end of this epic adventure  The book just drew me   wouldn't let me put  down  Whether you've read the first three books  this series  not READ THIS ONE!  You will  want to go back  read them all over agaWhen does the next one come  out?
What can I sayThis book is good! As soon as I got my copy on Saturday I couldn't put  down  Stoppg only to eat  sleep I was unable to qu readg until I fished on Sunday night  The fourth stallment of  this magical series stays true to the previous books by combg some of  the best fantasy ever wrten wh a touch of hum to create a fantastic  sty  As  is similar to the previous three the Goblet of Fire is also  very dferent  This novel troduces new colful characters spells  creatures  sights to Harry Potter's wizardg wld  Rowlg's  supernatural skills as a styteller  styweaver are well displayed   the many surprizes  unexpected twists that will keep you on your toes  She also expertly tied up some loose ends from the first three books while  creatg new ones that will leave us wantg me  I raise my goblet   salute JK Rowlg one of the greatest auths to pick up a quill   The Goblet of Fire the latest of her magical masterpieces
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is excellent!  It is darker than the pri three books but also extremely funny  I particularly liked the relationships between the students as they face many challenges rangg  from dragons to the big dance  It may be too dark  too long f some  younger readers but I thought  was great!
I was somewhat wried that after all the hype the authwould just rest on her laurels f the rest of the series but Gobletof Fire proved me wrong It contues the series nicely buildg suspense I que enjoyed  Someone did die but I still was happy wh the endg  am not terribly heartbroken Also I was wried that Harry Potter dealg wh girls would be credibly stupid spendg pages while ma characters stumbled around members of the oppose sex makg complete fools of themselves (I've seen  done  too many books befe) Ftunately I needn't have wried The part of the book was a very quiet  subtle subplot that you could igne easily  didn't trude on your readg  All  all this was a great book  I'm lookg fward to the rest of the series Oh  three cheers f Sirius my fave character! (no my fave isn't Harry)
This trigug long awaed sequel was a book I couldn't put down sce the moment I set my hs on   It is about a dangerous tournament (which Harry participates ) between three wizardg schools  As many of you  have heard yes someone (good) does die    The end was a b tricky  yet I fd  is still the best book that I've ever read
I pre-dered this book several months ago after polishg off Prisoner of Azkaban  After months of anticipation I am now ready f number of five  Goblet of Fire is another step above all of Rowlg's previous wk  wh the characters  plot takg on totally new depth  The length of  this book was a treat after wag so long  was nice to get such a  large dose of Harry Potter  Must read f all Potter fans
The Harry Potter books are such a pleasure to read that you can't help wonderg as you pick up each new volume  This Time Rowlg will have failed  fally turned out a fmulaic series book dumbed down f  prevailg views of mass consumption  lackg  the elctricy that  charges through the previous books  I am happy to rept that such is  defely NOT the case  The Goblet of Fire is a massive read yet   pulls you  from the first page  will not release s hold until the  last  Harry is as charismatic as ever adrt  secury  anched  by basic goodness  The book is deed darker than s predecesss but  Rowlg knows the lims of her youngest audience  never places their  sensibilies  harm's way  There are new trigug  delightful  characters wh hts of recurrg roles  the future  The adventures  are excg  never tre  hackneyed  All  all the book is a  charmer  self even whout the backsty of the ones that went befe  Like the thouss of others who got  yesterday I gave up sleep   fished  overnight (And I am long past the target age listed above!)  Thank you JK Rowlg
The fourth episode  the Harry Potter saga is as compellg  engagg as the first three  As the parent of a 10 year old I had some concerns that the themes of this new book (which Rowlg had suggested would be even  darker than volume three) might be too tense f my daughter  So I  bought  read  as soon as possible  I'm delighted to be able to say  that while there are certaly some frighteng episodes  developments  I found the overall tone to be considerably lighter than that of volume  three  The promised (by Rowlg) theme of romantic attachments is also  completely unobjectionable ( deed to me seems less developed than   some of the previous books)  Bottom le: buy  read  enjoy !
It was an extremely good book by the time we got back to Hogwarts but  took a long time to get there - about half the book  There were a lot of imptant clues  the first part of the book but I thk Ms Rowlg  could have hled them a ltle me quickly  Still  only took me 2   1/2 days to read the 752 pages  I'm sayg IV is the best yet!
This was a pretty good book by Ms Rowlg but  doesn't havethe explosive creativy as experienced  the first three tles  Itat times seems a b rushedbut I guess when she is given 1 year to wre  you can expect thatoverall a good read! =)
The new Harry Potter book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a defe bestseller  was the best book of the series as of the now The book opens wh a chillg discovery as well as mysteries yet to be solved  Harry soon leaves the Dursleys  attends the Quiddch Wld Cup wh the  Weasley's  Hermione Also Harry is still  contact wh his Godfather  Sirius Black After the Wld Cup Harry learns of Voldemt's followers  known as the Death Eaters  their treacherous past Thereafter Harry  fds himself back at Hogwarts  learng about the Triwazard Tournament  were a champion from Hogwarts  the other two schools Beauxabatons   Durmstrang compete  assted tasks To everyone's surprise Harry is  picked as a fourth champion Even Harry is unsure about how he was selected  f the Tournament Despe Snape  Malfoy's cricism  gloatg  Harry accepts his posion  goes fth wh the Triwizard Tournament As  Harry competes he is drawn to a death trap  is unlikely to come out  the vict Wh an explosive endg the book climaxs  darkness   readers are defetely gog to scream f Book 5 soon The book  my  opion surpasses that of the others due to better plot developement   twists New characters have been troduced as well as old ones returng  The book also surprises people due to the fact that good doesn't always  triumph over evil
I knew that I will like this book but still  was great to actually read !  When I saw the poster I did not like the illustration but  looked great on book cover The sty is combed wh two thgs a sty of the teenagers  the sty of the adults The best part was the  auth did not separate the two of them So the book was very well wrten   had a lot of thgs to read between les It was a ltle b heavy to  read (my arms are achg) but  was wth to spend my weekend wh  The  characters were developed que a lot  this book too I could see they  are actually GROWg Overall this book was as satisfyg as the other  three volumes
I just fished readg &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot After days of wag  fally arrived via Fedex  I was thrilled This book was absolutly amazg while expectg the trademark &quotplot  twist&quot that JK Rowlg always pulls of so remarkably I began early  on to look f clues that were beg slightly hted at a possible twist  So then I tryg to igne Harry Hermione  Ron's suspicions I  cooked up my own predictions about the plot twist to come So I read  axiously awag to see  the rums I had heard would become true When  I reached the end though I was  complete SHOCK There is absolutly no  way I could've cooked up a they anywhere near as amazg as JK's  endg Of course that's why she is the auth  I am the one stg  here awesricken by her compellg sty les that will keep me comg  back f me f as long as me will be available Read this book you  will value every 734 pages
I have been wag  wag f this book  when  fally arrived early Saturday mng (I predered  from amazoncom) I was plundged to pure bliss  I loved the book  It was very terestg  I liked  the was that  was clear that Harry has grown sce that fateful night on  a rock  the middle of the sea when Hagrid came to show him the way to  Hogwarts  Now I can't wa f the fth  Every 734 pages  27 pounds  of  was delicious f the md  I reccomend this book to anyone who  LOVES Harry Potter
I can't believe how great this series is  keeps gettg!  The changes  Harry throughout the four books  prt are credibly realistic  well done!  I love readg these books!  We got the book  spent the day  readg  from cover to cover - we couldn't put  down!  Harry's  commtment to self strength of character - not to mention courage! - are  very enjoyable!  It is also good to read a book where the characters are  very real wh each other!  Po Harry endures tauntg like never befe  at Hogwarts  the wld opens up to Hermione Ron etc through the Wld  Cup  the Triwizard Tournament The tests of fah courage magic  skill  bravery f Harry are wonderful frighteng humous   imagative  THANK YOU JK ROWLING!
I couldn't put  down It was crazy Everythg   was so good  the characters are given a great amout of deathAlso  f the fourth time I couldn't guess the endg I don't know how Rowlg keeps foolg  everyone
The 734 pages of this book kept me thoughly entertaed on a 15 hour car  ride Though seemgly long  parts the overall plot was very creative   well thought out  The reader learns que a b of the histy of  magic schools  the ig of the Harry Potter-Voldemt rivalry  The  attention to detail is astoundg  we were troduced to many new   terestg characters  It's great to see Harry grow up  to a  teenager we get to see his first crush  see him deal wh the feelgs  any teenager gets  It's also neat to see how the other characters develop  as they mature  I highly suggest this to book  Harry Potter fans  everywhere  Good readg muggles!
(Actual ratg: 45 starssee below) The sheer size of the book may be dauntg at first look (600+ f the Brish  Canadian versions 700+ f the US versions)  But that shouldn't stop most Potter fans from tryg  to read   one stg!  If you're new to the series this is not a  good book to beg wh as explanations f characters motivations   events that are key to the series are scattered throughout the text   the book will be much me appreciated ( understood!)  you are already  familiar wh the seriesRowlg's wrg has I feel improved as the  series has contued  Her hlg of the trials  problems of the  teenaged Harry  his friends is excellent addg weight  meang to  the action  the whimsy Her wrg style is just right f her  audience but even adults will fd places where her wrg is que  funny Rowlg's wks have moved away from beg just fantasy f the sake  of fantasy: the characters (ma  supptg both) feel grow   change existg  me than just a cardboard fantasy set Her characters  are well fleshed out realistically motivated  are firmly placed  a  solidly-plotted  complicated wld  There is real-wld relevance here  f the reader an examation  confrontation of philosophical issues  such as good  evil matury jealously  friendship  other(dare  we say ?) adult themes The fact that these are essential problems  the  sty set  apart from much lighter escape-iented fictionThere are  some m problems wh the wk but nothg that will distract most  readers who get caught up  the action the danger  the sheer pleasure  of watchg these characters teract  their imagative wldThis  book is not exactly slow  startg but  is long  startg (due to  the episode of the Quiddch Wld Cup which is nearly a book  self)  But the openg still leads well to the rest of the book  becomes an  essential part of the narrative  I rate this book 45 stars simply because  of the problem of the length of the pre-Hogwarts section of the book--'s  almost like readg a sht sty  novella serted befe the novel  Readers who are used to the openg to the books so far(ie escape from  the Dursleys leadg quickly to the tra to Hogwarts) may fd this a  dficult lump of text to get over  Quiddch fans of course will love  !Havg read Canadian versions of all the books I am displeased by  the decision of the USA publishers to &quotAmericanize&quot certa  terms--I believe that they are not givg children cred f their  telligence  dealg wh new terma  vocabularyThis book contas  me of the same thgs that Harry Potter fans are lookg f along wh  a slightly greater depth  sophistication that are a welcome addion to  the series I look fward to readg these wh my future children becomes an  essential part of the narrative  I rate this book 45 stars simply because  of the problem of the length of the pre-Hogwarts section of the book--'s  almost like readg a sht sty  novella serted befe the novel  Readers who are used to the openg to the books so far(ie escape from  the Dursleys leadg quickly to the tra to Hogwarts) may fd this a  dficult lump of text to get over  Quiddch fans of course will love  !Havg read Canadian versions of all the books I am displeased by  the decision of the USA publishers to &quotAmericanize&quot certa  terms--I believe that they are not givg children cred f their  telligence  dealg wh new terma  vocabularyThis book contas  me of the same thgs that Harry Potter fans are lookg f along wh  a slightly greater depth  sophistication that are a welcome addion to  the series I look fward to readg these wh my future children
Anyone who's waed f months f the new Harry was fally given reprieve this weekend as Harry Potter #4 h the shelves  After devourg the book over the weekend 's apparent that Ms Rowlg did  aga  It's just as magical  wonderful as the first books  especially  brilliant  beguilg towards the end  You won't read a better kids'  book f years!
Like most I have read the books  sequence  I eagerly awaed this one wh high expectations  they were surpassed Many mysteries are woven  around new characters  I solved an easier one but missed the gr plot  I've already started readg the book aga  A marvelous mystery
THE BEST BOOK YET SAYS MY 12 YEAR OLD GRANDSON GOT THE BOOK JULY 8 AT 10:16 AM FED EXPRESS AND HAD COMPLETED READING BY 5 PM SUNDAY JULY 9
JK Rowlg is credible! Each book  this series just keeps gettg better  better!  This book is much darker than the previous three but 's just as compellg All the characters grow up a b we see lots of  familiar faces  There isn't a sgle dull moment!  I can't wa f book  5!
Rowlg's lastest stallment is a well-crafted sty that moves quickly all the way to the end  Yes  is &quotdarker&quot but not too much so-- certaly not enough to scare away young readers My only question is:  How much longer til #5?
When I first read the 1st three after meetg JK Rowlg at the &quotWhale of a Tale&quot  Irve CA I was so impressed  truiged by the book's content that I longed f me I was patiently but exedly  awag the arrival of &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  when  came I was  the happiest guy The begng kda freaked me out but the rest was just  fascatg I cant wa f the next 3!
i love harry potter  i only got hooked because i read a book befe i gave  as a gt now i am a fanatic  book 4 is as good as i wanted  to be  i waed 3 months f   i am only on chapter 9 but  is true  harry potter feshadowg  don't miss a page  don't miss a thought  adults  kids will go wild iam
It's hard to to wre a review whout givg away some of thesome of the secret  part of the endg so  you haven't read thebook  you don't want  spoiled don't read this reviewThis book was very dark much darker  scarier than any of the other three  I would not recommend readg  to young children especially befe bed  It put much me emphasis on Voldemt's old suppters the Death Eaters than ever befe  We fd out who they were wh some surprises  how some of them got out of gog to Azkaban Many fd themselves  an awkward posion when Voldemt is on the rise aga  The first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemt  Harry is not metioned at all  Secondly there were deaths  this book  Through this book we come to better underst the suation befe Voldemt's downfall the terr the chaos  the uncertaty of not knowg who was on your side  who was really supptg the Dark Ld But despe  perhaps because of that this book is  my opion the best  the series  It is certaly the longest at 700+ pages  There is lots of laughs lots of venture  lots of hilarious attempts at romance  Its not too mushy though don't wry  Its not all dark  scary though  Harry goes to the Quiddich Wld Cup wh the Weasleys he  Ron have an terestg time fdg dates f the Yule Ball He Ron  Hermione have happy times hangg out  the common room  there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred  Gege Weasley  There are lots of funny new characters too  An extremely paranoid new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher an annoygly nosy Daily Prophet repter students from the other two school f Wizardry  Europe-Beaubaxtons  Durmstrang  a Wld Cup Quiddch player  love wh Hermione I laughed out loud many times while readg this bookNo book is perfect  though these are great I have a few problems First of all does everybody havea secret they never tell Harry? It always seems that he  we are always the last to knowAll  all this is a great book that everyone should defately read!  Buy  today!
This fourth book should be a treat f adults  older kids As Harry  his friends grow up they beg me  me to see the dark side of their wld  the dangers posed by those whose use of their powers is not  altogether pure School jealousies rivalries  friendships beg to  take on new dimensions as these children take their first steps to  adulthood I thk that younger children may be somewhat bewildered by some  of the motivations that are whirlg under the surface of these characters   by the new darker cast of the plot (Voldemt's suppters are not  pleasant) But I couldn't put the book down  that  self is sayg  somethg These books simply get better  me complex wh each new  stallment Rowlg has managed to create a complete parallel wld that  makes  easy to suspend your disbelief
I really loved this book!  I got  yesterday  I only put  down to eat  when my mom made me  I would love to be wh Harry Potter  this book  His adventures keep you on the edge of your seat wh excement  suspense  You're never sure what will come next  who will be his ally   his enemy  If you love magical  thrillg books that give you a  rush of adrenale then this is the book f you  I can't wa f the  next one!  I'm so jealous that the Brish get to see the books first!
This book is both the longest  best yet  the series  I read  twice  three days  It is very tense  do pay attention to Ron  Harry fakg their homewk f divation because they actually come off que  well  :-)  The endg is que tense   your ltle one wants to  read  you read the last 50 pages first
Like thouss of people I led up on Friday night at my local chaste behemoth to buy the new &quotHarry Potter&quot I never expected a seven-hundred page dostop but here  is (It is givg  nothg away to say that the plot of this book when added to the the sty  arc of the planned seven-book series reveals JK Rowlg's master plan)  If every hero needs a darkest hour (Luuuuuke    I am your faaather)  this is If you are one of the nervous milquetoasts who have already  expressed misgivgs about Rowlgs' suabily f children this book  will only confirm your fears as the plot is even darker  demg of  me emotional matury than the third stallment of the series &quotThe  Prisoner of Azkaban&quot And this time I can almost see your  potNevertheless &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot mostly lives up to  the promise of the first three books Rowlg knows enough not to mess wh  a wng fmula so the plot follows the basic les of the other--  encompassg one year at Hogwarts startg  endg wh Harry at the  Dursleys etc But this time there are so many extras  surprises both  pleasant  nasty that they sometimes threaten to overwhelm the fward  momentum of the plot We fally fd out about Neville Longbottom's  parents other schools of magic  a great many bs about the followers  of Voldemt ( really    I need to expla any of this you're   the wrong place) There's plenty of the old wonder  magic that the first  three books delivered so well but these are met wh a me complex  emotional lscape This makes a certa amount of sense as Harry is now  what fteen years old?Like Steven Kg Rowlg seems to be developg  a chronic need to over-wre her novels The good side of this is that she  opens up a pletha of great plot les f development  the later books  (Wa 'til you fd out about Hagrid! )Personally I feel that kids may  be exposed to almost anythg  done wh parental guidance but some will  feel novel of this length  complexy might be pushg  Rowlg has a  knack f wrg wh an engagg magical simplicy but the climax of  this book has nothg childlike about But befe this review turns  long   &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot mostly fulfills the immense  promise of the first three but Rowlg can't make the scary parts any  darker whout turng the cner to wrg f adults Nevertheless  havg fished  at two this mng I'm gog to pick  up aga   like the others  this series start over at the begngbe exposed to almost anythg  done wh parental guidance but some will  feel novel of this length  complexy might be pushg  Rowlg has a  knack f wrg wh an engagg magical simplicy but the climax of  this book has nothg childlike about But befe this review turns  long   &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot mostly fulfills the immense  promise of the first three but Rowlg can't make the scary parts any  darker whout turng the cner to wrg f adults Nevertheless  havg fished  at two this mng I'm gog to pick  up aga   like the others  this series start over at the begng
The fourth Harry Potter stallment will be loads of fun f all Harry Potter fans  newbies too Rowlg does a great job of cludg crucial background from the series throughout the book to catch you up  you  haven't read all three of the other Potter volumes Although I suspect  you'll want to do so the mute you fish this one -- they are addictive  The series is great f many ages I'm 28  started readg the series on  the recommendation of someone  my office  eagerly awaed the release  of this latest volume If you read The Chronicles of Narnia as a kid  you'll love these booksThe Goblet of Fire is a good book although I  have to adm I did fd  cumbersome to lug around 730 pages all weekend  I do remember readg the first three  beg sry they were over  I  was ready f this one to be doneI thk just from havg read so much  But  didn't drag There was lots of excement  I'm already lookg  fward to the next one!As much as I liked this one I thk the third  volume is still my fave But this is a keeper's a fe place to  beg the Potter series  a great place to contue
As a 30-somethg woman I fd that a lot of my friends raise their eyebrows skeptically when I mention Harry Potter  &quotAren't those children's books?&quot they evably ask  Well yes they are  But  our Harry is growg up  In this 4th book of her Harry Potter series  Rowlg has delved much deeper to the dark side of the wizard wld  The  reader can see Rowlg stretchg toward a full-fledged battle between the  fces of good (Potter)  evil (Voldemt)  There is a feelg of an  epic here unlike her first three books which although que charmg  always left this reader feelg slightly as  she had just watched an  episode of Scooby Doo -- &quotAnd I would have gotten away wh  too   not f those meddlg kids!&quot  But there's none of that here kids  might actually walk away from this one a ltle afraid  Not only is there  the death of a maj character  this particular book but there is a lot  of death altogether  Ld Voldemt is not a slightly cartoonish villian  anyme  Oh no he does grievous hurt a lot of   F the first  time the readers get a sense of how large  sister Voldemt's  followg really is the true evil  weaknesses that really lie   the hearts of men  This book almost 740 pages long is Rowlg's triumph   this series so far  Some of the me humous characters show up  briefly Peeves the Poltergeist Nearly Headless Nick Dobby the Elfbut  make no bones about  Rowlg's gettg down to busess This is no  longer Harry's explos  boardg schoolthis is war sometimes  war gets uglyI would recommend this book to all Harry Potter fans   to any would-be converts  You haven't read Harry Potter until you've  read THIS Harry Potter  Voldemt is on the move Harry is growg up the  battle is on this reader is bucklg her seatbelt f Rowlg's wild  ride
Well I te through this book  two days  found  to be another excellent example of the stytellg talents of JK Rowlg  The only cricism I had of the first three books was that the dark characters that  provide Harry wh his challenges were undeveloped caricatures notably  Draco Malfoy  Ld Voldemt  This volume takes great strides   developg the villas The series also contues to develop as great  mysteries  The clues are fairly planted throughout the book  kids will  love the contued attention to detail  I am an English teacher  aware  of the challenges agast this series while this stallment is  certaly darker  will be sure to provide ammunion f those who  search desperatly f  I still thk  is a magical series that opens  the eyes of children to the joys of readg  the fun of fantasy  lerature
Fantastic!  Very much  keepg wh the previous books but gettg darker  It seems that the auth is wrg f readers that are agg along wh Harry rather than anticipatg that young readers just comg  onto the series are gog to read all of the books at age 8  9  Feshadowg at the end of Book 4 dicates that the 5th book will be a  real hair-raiser  WHEN IS IT DUE?  I CAN'T WAIT!
the mute i picked up this latest Harry Potter book i could (lerrly!) not put  down The suspense builds as Harry dreams about the whearabouts of Volde- oops! I mean you-know-who then to an vation to the Quiddch  Wld cupImagavley detailed  the most thrillg tear jerkg  chillg novel yet It's hard to believe the sayg &quotthe best is yet  to come&quot after you've fished this book!
J K Rowlg  does  aga!  We had to buy 2 !  Couldn't put  down the plot is excellentKeep up the good wk JK  We can't wa to see number 5!
I just fished the fourth book  the thrillg Harry Potter series  This book was amazg absolutely amazg  Ms Rowlg has done  aga  The characters were lovable  very believable  the plot kept you  guessg until the end  I was so caught up  this wonderful sty I found  myself fishg  at 2:00am  I reccomend this book to everyone who might  be cravg a good sty  It truly is a must read
The Harry Potter books were all really good! The whole series have been followed closely by many people but when you actually read the fourth book I thk most people will fd  dferent from all the rest! It also takes  a big step when one of the characters is killed (I will not say who!) And  I am sure that everyone has noticed that  is clearly the longest book! I  thk that the plot is very good  that the book is very well wrten!  Although this year Harry is kept busy durg the summer! Of course Harry is  still always  trouble  still sneakg around the school! But all the  same  is a ltle dferent from all the rest of the Harry Potter books!  (I did not say really much about the plots so those that have not read   will not fd out anythg!)                       ~Enjoy~
The darkest of the four  the series Filled wh magic  mystery Wonderful sty le though I'm not sure 's suable f younger children Great read!
(Wrten by a 10-year-old--almost 11--girl) I wouldn't recommend the fourth Harry Potter book to anyone under 10  11 F most of the book I was shiverg  terried The last 100 pages lerally made me sick to  my stomach I am surprised at JK Rowlg I thought she would wre a  lighter sty But I can't say I didn't like the book because I did It  made me feel like I was  the room wh the characters But  left me  feelg disappoted that  wasn't what I had anticipated
A Harry Potter addict I was so happy when this monstrous fourth stallment arrived at my dostep  I sat down stantly  haven't put  down yet  The book surpasses the fantastic first three novels  adds  me than one new twist on to Harry's magical journey to Hogwarts  the  wizardg communy  An absolute must-have f everyone agesd 7 to 77!
I stayed up half the night readg this newest Harry Potter book It remds me why I fell  love wh books  the first place Ms Rowlg makes  fun to read aga! I don't want to give any secrets away so I'll  just say  die hard fans will NOT be disappoted Hoay f Harry!
This the fourth harry potter book is fabulous! While hmones start to kick  somethg very special  new is comg to hogwarts! And He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is tryg to rise aga s length makes   me enjoyable!
I'm not gog reveal any secrets about the plot but will simply say that I could not put this book down  read through   one (very long) stg!  Another Marvelous Masterpiece by Rowlg!
This amazg book the fourth  auth JK Rowlg's series about a young wizard Harry Potter who is attendg school at Hogwarts School of Wchcraft  Wizardry tells the dramatic tale of our hero's fourteenth  year-  fourth year of schoolThe tale opens wh an excg  vation to the Quiddch Wld Cup- I won't tell you who ws! Harry   his friends Ron  Hermione then go back to school They discover that the  Triwizardg Tournament has been revived  champions of three schools of  wizardry (there are others! ) will compete f the hon of the school!  Voldemo- oh sry He-who-must-not-be-named lurks as always  the  background  wag  watchg f his chance at Harry the boy who  resisted his curse when no other could!Rowlg's artistry  her gt  f brgg another wld to le are at an all-time high  this tome of  a book Never fear! The length makes the book all that much me  terestg even f children It's twice as long twice as volved -   will take twice as long to fish - as book three It's full of puzzles   mysteries of all shapes  sizes This book IS darker than the others -  thk of &quotEmpire Strikes Back&quot but  certaly sets the scene  f further Harry adventures! When does book five arrive?
Harry is back!  This book is all that JK Rowlg promised  would be  Another funny look at our fave Mugglesthe Dursleys ( Dudley just might lose a few pounds)  sights to why Harry is fced to stay wh  them every summer Expect a lot of laugh-out-loud funny stuff  a  page-turng great adventure  The book gets very tense near the end so  parents might want to decide  their own children are ready f   You  will learn me about the past of Tom Riddle  watch Harry cope wh the  fces of good  evil  the wld of wizards  The qualy of this book  is at least as good as the other three It is my fave of the first 4 I  highly recommend   Enjoy !
Harry Potter has long been a book not just f children but f adults as well  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is Rowlgs' best wk yet --  not only lives up to the expectations of the first three stallments but   exceeds them  terms of excement  plot development Never befe  has Voldemt seemed so terryg never befe has Harry been so brave   never befe have we been so enthralled by the possibilies    What  will happen  the Triwizard Tournament?  Will Voldemt reappear?  Will  Harry (*gulp*) express his true feelgs to Cho?  Where's Sirius?  And who  the heck is this paranoid Moody? Rowlg has presented us the readg  public wh a stunng wk  It's impossible to put down  My Fed Ex  arrived at 2 pm Saturday I had started the book by 2:30  by 9:30 was  wipg my brow as I fished the fal page If you're lookg f a  keep-you-on-your-toes kd of book Goblet of Fire is f you
As a sixteen year old male most would thk that the Harry Potter series would't appeal to me However the wrg self is of a qualy that is  oft unseen  many books aimed at an older audience Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire the newest book  the series reaches a pnacle of  qualyJ K Rowlgs outdid herself this time The massive novel  almost the length of the first three combed has the development of  plotles that were first seen  the first novel Events fecast  the  previous novels reach a head  envelop the reader as they change the  wizardg wld as we know  Many figures of authy are exposed as  crupt  those thought crupt are shown to be truly on the side of  Harry Dumblede  all those who would st wh themAs a whole  the series is good enough f any young person who might wish to read   However as wh many other media the greatest fans of the series are  outside the target audience Whether a teacher who sees a child whom  they've had trouble teachg to read stg  le to buy  someone  like myself who sees the true value of the novels f someone older than  the target ten  eleven these novels Goblet of Fire especially are a  fe example of modern fantasy J K Rowlgs deserves to be ranked among  such as Mercede Lackey Marion Zimmer Bradley  Melanie Rawn as the best  auths of modern fantasy no matter the target audience After all   hasn't stopped me from readg them yet!
Which fills  so many plot questions  asks so many me JK Rowlg's characters are genue - not real obviously but  their alternative universe are completely realisic  wonderful to read about  They are  perfectly scary  all the right parts   the right proptions but  's probably not a book f the Under 8's to read alone - even  they do  read  to themselves 's good f parents to be nearby durg the last  150 pages  so But 's a terric book f everyone over that age to  read to share to talk about wh friends  to read over  over aga
Harry Potter #4 was one of the best books  the series I couldnot put  down f the entire weekend because  was so good It hasa great plot that keeps you thkg through the entire book The end is very terestg  will make you want to read the next book right away I loved   hope that the Harry Potter don't lose their touch once me of them come out
I was stg on the couch at home when my neighb called He asked  I wanted to brow the new Harry Potter book Of course I said yes I sat down  began to read At first I was put off by the length of the book  but  was credibly fast paced  adventurous Harry Potter returns to  school f his fourth year  fds himself entered anonymously to the  Triwizard Tournement You are troduced to some terestg new  characters but you still keep up wh the previos characters such as Dobby  from book #2 I was completly swept away while readg this book It took  me less than 1 day to fish Harry potter  the Goblet of Fire I cannot  wa f the fth book!
All of your fave characters are back  this latest stallment  We also now know that there will be at least 7 Harry Potter books  the seriesThis book followed the successful fmulas of the previous Harry  Potter books  Start wh a b of bg Muggle Le abuse of the  Dudleys  move fward to HogwartsWe do get to see a lot of  dferent character developments  this book  Harry Ron  Hermionie  all have become me 3 dimensional  We see them attackg issues other  than the current problem on h  we beg to get a feel of what  they're thkg side  where they will be gogOne character that  could have been used me powerfully was Sirius  Harry's new Godfather is  back  there was an early attempt to get him deeply vovled  the  sty  But somehow Sirius was not there when we needed him mostI  would compare this book to Empire Strkes Back's place  the Starr Wars  trilogy as this book moves a b away from a simple feel good sty to  somethg settg the scenes f the comg booksIt was very  enjoyable readg the book  The magic is back
I thought this was a great book but  was too long f a younger kid who may get discouraged seeg the number of the pages the book has  That was the only drawback  I must say that I cannot wa until the entire series  is released
I was surprised by the length of the book but found  absolutely rivetg throughout The auth has made  credibly easy to laugh  cry along wh the characters she's created I found parts of  brgg  back embarassg memies of high school  Que a b of the book made me  thk  's a real treat to see the best tras  wst foibles of  humany so delightfully packaged  a fm that both kids  adults can  consume whout leavg anythg further to be desired (except f the  sequels! ) despe the age range I'm really exced about the next book!
This book is wth all the hype  all the fuss everyone has been makg about   I just spent two days readg  (slowly to sav the experience)  I was blown away by the darkness  presence of a me vicious evil here than  the previous stallments  After wkg at a  Harry Potter Party to celebrate the release I realized how drawn to this  stuff most kids are  They knew mute details about the characters  the  sties that I thk most people wouldn't thk twice about  Now I'm  exced to see where  goes because the end of this one is the start of  somethg big!
I wish I had given  to temptation  bought a second copy of Goblet of Fire to avoid the embarrassg tug of war I had wh my 9 year old over whose turn  was to read  I won't spoil the sty but 's every b as every b as wonderful as the last three books  twice as long  Plenty  of laughs  middle school sights (like bubtubers  the Yule Ball)  that will have adults flashg back to 14  A warng: don't try to read  the last 150 pages as a bedtime sty  It's too scary f kids  the  next good place to stop readg  go to sleep is the end of the book  Thank you Ms Rowlg f a wonderful weekend!
This is by far Rowlg's best book I just fished  last night (at 2:30 am)  I couldn't put  down What suspense! As always the plot is credibly tight -- I look f the clues I see the clues  I still  can't figure out how  is gog to end By the time I fished the chapter  on the goblet of fire (chapter 16) I knew I was gog to be  f an  credible ride Now we will all just have to see how Harry  Dumblede  deal wh the evil that has been released At least we know f sure who  some of the bad guys are now! Maybe we'll have a ltle less pretense   polics  the Mistry  face the fact that some of Voldemt's  suppters are still around --   some pretty powerful posions Thank  you J K f another fantastic book -- truly the best one yet
I read many books  this book is defately my fave one EVER  It combes many genre's of books scary mystery romance  comedy  It is suspensful  you cannot put  down  It may be the best book ever  wrten

JK Rowlg has created a wonderful wk of children's fantasy wh her fourth entry  the Harry Potter series In Goblet of Fire the young magician's travails are tensied  the plot this time is darker than   any of the previous novels: Harry is growg up From fast-paced  Quiddch games to suspenseful magic battles Goblet of Fire is full of the  tremendously detailed wrg that we all have grown to expect from  Rowlg  can be considered a wthy addion to the award wng  series
This book contues a good styIt was a b long  I missed the Quiddch matches  Also I could do whout the summaries from past booksBUT----the sty surprised me aga  some great sub sties  made me cry about 5 times The new magic that Harry does is great  I  also enjoyed their &quotRomances&quotI am lookg fward to the next  one
I'm seven years old  this is my first book review Even though there were some scary parts I thk that this was the best Harry Potter book so  far There were some old friends  some new people too Crabbe  Goyle  are scarier than you thk  there is a new teacher at Hogwarts There  were some excg thgs  some really funny parts Anyone who liked the  Scerer's Stone the Chamber of Secrets  the Prisoner of Azkaban will  love the Goblet of Fire! I liked  so much I read all 734 pages  two  days!
As JK Rowlgs has said  terviews the Harry Potter books are ultimately about the struggle of good vs evil  In this 4th book the battle truly begs between these fces represented by Harry  Ld  Voldemt  Over time Voldemt has slowly gaed strength  is now  poised to beg his dark fight f power once me  Battle les are drawn    numerous plot twists the auth makes  truly dficult to know  whether a character is friend  foe  This is a very excg but me  frighteng  complex book than the others  Emotions are strong  the  ultimate consequences of battlg evil become evident to all  Parts of  this book may be too frighteng f young children Although the first  three books are recommended f those 9-11 years of age this one is me  appropriate f those 12  up
A delightful contuation of the Harry Potter saga  I was completely surprised by the endg after havg thought I figured out a key plot element early on  Don't let the length put you off (sales dicate nobody  is lettg anythg put them off) the book flies by quickly is very  entertag  excg  is never bg  And f once they expla  how to pronounce Hermione's name!
Can I put my der  f the fth one now?
After all the hype  anticipation of the new book &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot was defely wth the wa Some people were wried that  would be too long f kids but they will keep readg this  no matter how long  takes Some people were wried about rums flyg  back  fth about the books contually growg darker Some people were  wried that after all the wag that  wouldn't live up to expectation  but  was beyond expectation It was brilliant I laughed I cried I  loved Unlike the other books  the series this one does not see  Harry to Hogwarts until after chapter 11 But those chapters befe are by  no means bg In these chapters you can see why there were rums of  the tle beg &quotHarry Potter  the Quiddch Wld Cup&quot    a slightly later chapter &quotHarry Potter  the Doomspell  Tournament&quot They are there to set the stage f the greater plot  which thickens wh the turng of every pageBut the ma plot of the  book might have somethg to do wh the fact that Harry is now fourteen  And when he was one Voldemt tried to kill him That was thirteen years  ago but thirteen is an unlucky numberThe question now is: What are we  gog to do wag f Book five!
I went to a book party to get this book the moment  was released Like all of Rowlgs other books you can read  many times  not tire of  Dferences: someone dies HermioneRon Harry each develop a 'crush'  but Voldemt still plays the crucial villian role To tell the truth this  book was not all  was cracked up to be Though all  all the book was  a good long read
The fourth stallment is me challengg  an even better read than the first three Me imptant events occur  this book than the first three combed This may make f a scarry read f very young readers but  others will fd this causes the book to become me excg  addictive  than ever Personally I couldn't wa to read The Goblet of Fire longed  f me when  ended  can't wa f the next stallment!
The wa is overthe les have dissipatedall that remas are the half empty bookstes that braved thouss over the weeekend The question is was  wth wag up till midnight to be able to secure a copy of  the fourth book? Did Rowlg underst what was expected of her? The  answer is unequivocaly yes She has taken her series to the next level She  understs that most readers of her books are no longer just kids but  people of all ages I am a college student  was shocked at how much I  enjoyed this It's as fast paced as any thriller  me imagative than  any fantasy wrten today The book starts wh our trepid hero Harry  endg another summer wh those beastly Muggles also known as the  Dursleys Then he is whisked away wh by the Weasleys to the Wld Cup  Its amazg that you are almost 200 pages  until he starts his fourth  year at Hogwarths a school f wizards The book takes awhile to propel  the ma plot foward  parts are easy to predict (after all our hero must  always be  the center stage) but none of this matters This book manages  to rise above the previous three  the endg is certaly chillg I  wa wh abated breath until the next one  the series comes out The  series is now truly startg  my opion
While this book was longer than the first three  seemed toconta so much less  There was a lot of sty but no poignancy richness  The book lacked the verbal patgs JK Rowlg did so well  the first three  Hogwarts felt a b old hat like there was nothg new to show us there  I also felt certa characters had been built up just f martyrdom stead of the drama of a volvg a character f which we already cared   Harry seemed crabby  moodier  this book but he is becomg a teenager!  On the posive side  did seem like this book was a gateway to better me excg books  Several dferent plotles were developed f the future books  this entry Harry Potter is gog to face a lot of dficult battles  the future!  While I did not thk the book was great  as good as the last three  is defately a must read  you want to fully experience what I suspect will be a great 5th book When does that one come out aga?
I got this book on Saturday (thanks to the amazoncom shippg special they had)  I fished  on sunday (thanks to me readg fast)  I fished the book  I didn't know what to say  I had read the 3  previous books  was expectg a lot from this book perhaps unfairly  so  this book just didn't live up to what I was expectgFirst I  might have an unfairly biased opion seeg as how I am probably  &quotoutside&quot the tended age of the readers of this book but when  you fd great lerature such as Jk Rawlgs has wrten I don't thk  there should be any age lim  bounds on who can read Havg said  that I thought the first 3 books were magical whimsical  touched off  somethg  each of us that very few auths can do  I thk that this  4th book didn't que capture that same feelg  left me feelg as  though the auth really pushed this book out  struggledto meet a page  limI wasn't exceptionally impressed I thk that the characters need  a breath of fresh air  I thk the book needs to break out of the mold   is gettg to  The first 3 books &quotwked&quot very well the  whole l  settg were new  the concepts were new  JK Rawlgs  granted new characters  new thgs  each book but I st of thk  that she needed somethg drastically new f this book  she didn't do  I got st of tired readg this book  needed me alhtough   was a lot longer than the last 3 books I don't thk  covered as much as  1 of the previous books  I have the feelg that Rawlgs was pushed to  make this book long  that the sty didn't come from her heart but  rather from her md  She didn't appear to be wrg to have fun but  rather wrg to meet a deadleI know the begng of this review is  not very favable f the book but overall this book was a good book  I  would defely suggest buyg   readg  you will still be amazed   delighted by the scenery adn settg the characters are teh same   the evil is evillerI just expected a ltle me from this authill be amazed   delighted by the scenery adn settg the characters are teh same   the evil is evillerI just expected a ltle me from this auth
I have waed f 12 long months f the release of the fourth book  the Harry Potter series Our  hero Harry Potter is back to battle agast he-who-must-not-be-named This is a sty about friendship loyalty  the good agast the evil I like the Harry Potter books because they tell a  sty about a boy who does all those thgs we know we should do but very  often don't because we lack the courage Harry Potter has It touches on the  noble stct that lives  all of us  challenges us to be as  courageous as Harry F those who are new to the Harry Potter books I  would recommend them to start from the first book - Harry Potter  the  Philosopher's Stone ( Socerer's Stone  the US edion) I have fished  readg this book  two days  now I have to wa another 12 long months  f the next stalment
i realy enjoyed this book   was better than the other thee Harry Potter books conmed   was over 700 pages long but  was so good i read   3 days   is a good book f kids as well as adults  i recomend that you  read this book   is an adventure!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best yet! The plot is a b me volved than the 3 earlier books yet is fast paced  I thought I had some of the mysteries solved but was kept guessg until the very end  Because of the fast pace complicated plot  serious themes this is  probably the Harry Potter that adults will like the best JK Rowlgs deals  wh some serious themes  Goblet of Fire me than she has  the  earlier Harry Potter books but 's certaly not too dark f kids  There's plenty of hum  fun too It's clear Harry is growg up   maturg It's only appropriate that the sties do the same I got the  book on Saturday  read almost non-stop until I had  fished I  defely did NOT want to put this book down Now I have to wa until my  friends fish so we can talk about !
This is a very colful imagative piece of wk I've enjoyed every mute of readg wh my son It keeps you on edge  really connects you  to the characters  this enchantg midieval settg There are many  questionable moments that make you wonder who  could be behd some of  the fascatg cidents this young boy occurs a whirlwd of majical  moments that brg commrody wh his pals which were meant to be wh him   this heroic taleWe are lookg fward to JK Rowlg's &quotHarry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot
The Harry Potter series seems to get better wh eachbook This time Harry is faced wh even darker magic a wizardgtournament  an unusual twist of events It is sure to send a chill down your spe when Voldemt (the darkest wizard) returns  when Harry (growg older) is turned down by a girl when he asks her to the dance It's everythg  one: a drama a comedy a fantasy  even a ltle of a romance And all that is left to say is that Rowlg has done  aga: stirred our imagations Still we hope (as   were real) that Harry makes  through his next three years at Hogarts hopg that JK Rowlg can do  aga
This book is new good  beautulwhat can be said about a long awaed book?  Nothg but this:   When readg the first chapter the reader gets taken to a whole perspective of readg everythg from the  old le of Tom Riddle to the paralelle universe of Ld  VoldeerYou-Know-Who  We soon fd out what Harry  the rest of  Hogwarts is  ste f  Beg the first to review this book I don't  want to spoil anythg f our younger readers but I can say that  is  chillg to the pot where I almost put the book down but don't  hassle the Wld Cup is great
Boy was this an EXCELLENT book!  Out of all four books this one is by far the best The way the plot is designed makes the book a real &quotpage-turner&quot  The best part about readg this book is how  the auth describes everythg so realisticly   makes you feel as   you were gog to school at Hogwarts wh Harry  his friends  This  book comes wh alot of unexpected turns I recommend  to anyone who  wants an action packed adventure filled wh  turns  twists that will  really surprise you  I recommend the age group f this book 10 to ANY  AGE! Overall 's an EXCELLENT book that proves &quotthe wa was wth  ! &quot
The twistg  glious plot of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire once aga transfers the reader to a whole other wldthe wld of magic The book self was marvelous! Dumblede's speech brought tears to my  eyes  Fudge's ignance brought me fumg!Vast amounts of Harry  Potter fans have been wag (not very patiently md you) f the  release of the fourth book now that 's here The Goblet of Fire  will fce the other three books to st  's shadow And  FINALLYquestions fans have been wonderg over f the past year were  answered! But of course JK Rowlg leaves the most imptant I thk  questions to be answered  the next booksWell only about a year  until Harry Potter Five!
JK Rowlg's Harry Potter books are wonderful!  All four ofher books are great f kids of all ages I rate her booksexceptionally well Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire is my fave of all! I am lookg fward to her next books!
I really enjoyed this book  I didn't thk that the Harry Potter books could have gotten any better but I was wrong  This is a wonderful book wh all the special qualies of the earlier books  But Harry is growg  up  this book is truly wrten wh the md of an older child  It is  wonderful that she can change the style of wrg enough to make us  believe that Harry is gettg older  It is a great book!
I thought this book was the best out of the four Harry Potter books It had everythg  everyone one could possibly want-- a quiddch match house-elves rivalry lots of suspense  of course bickerg between  Ron &amp Hermione! It was long but well wth the efft :-)
My 14 year old son  I each raced through the latest stallment of Harry Potter's adventures this weekend We both were transpted once aga to the complete universe created by auther JK Rowlg  Yes  was  longer  darker than the previous books but seldom has an auth had  such control of her sty The readers may not know where Rowlg is headed  but she has a clear vision skillfully addg new  trigug characters  while deepeng our knowledge  understg of familiar ones Harry   his friends are believable teenagers too dealg wh the problems of  young adolescents as well as magical challenges We can't wa f volume  5!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was wth the months  months of wag dreamg  rereadg the first three books  Although I had planned to read only a few chapters at a time to sav the experience I  te through the whole thg  two days  This book cannot be put down f  long  JK Rowlg contues to add wonderful detail  flav to her  magical wld some of  very funny some of  downright terryg but  all of  terric  The fourth book  the series is darker than the other  three as Harry matures  faces me  me of the Dark Arts but Harry   his friends rema determed  true throughout  Some of  is a  ltle gruesome f younger readers but  is balanced well agast the  lessons of honesty nobily  courage that Harry Potter always has to  share
Harry Potter as only a few Muggles don't know is a wld famous boy His parents were killed years befe by He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named his early years were a misery beg abused  derided by his mother's relatives  but he found at the age of 11 that he was  fact a famous person  the  wonderful wld of magic  was ved to attend an school of magic  called Hogwarts His first three years there are fully documented  the  first three books of this marvelous seriesBut now Harry is growg up  He is rapidly becomg a teenager  the dangers of his wld are  becomg serious as well This new book  the series while twice as long  as the previous books never drags  seems drawn out The exposion of  the previous books is done quickly  smoothly whout bg readers  already enscounced  Harry's wld the characters of Harry's best  friends Ron  Hermoe are me deeply developed  the menace of  Harry's arch enemy He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named deepened to a real danger  Both Harry's wld  ours are led to a dark  chllg denouement that  will only leave readers beggg f the next book! Maybe  we all wk a  magic spell? Please hurry Ms Rowlg! Muggles f Harry fever!
When I first got Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire book four  this popular series I couldn't wa to read   And wh good reason! I've been wag f at least 6 monthsanyway I would like to say that JK  Rowlg has really showed the feelgs of joy srow  hatred  this  enjoyable sty Her style of wrg is extradary  the idea is  beautully crafted
I couldn't put  down  I really loved  -- f fans of the series this is an excellent sequel to Book III  Me histy behd the rise of Voldemt  even me fun  spells  hilarious characters but wh a  touch of seriousness  Excellent set-up f the last three books  The only  problem is that I can't wa f the next book to come out!
It's a wonderful book  st of concludes all the other 3 books!
i just fished   was the best yet i must adm i skipped the parties  let amazon brg  to my house at which pot i began to devour  i had read a child's review that said the first chapter was a  ltle slow humph!  was the perfect set up i am an avid brish mystery  fan  i saw so many me elements of that  this book  addion to  the great fantasy that is harry potter already this book is credibly  well wrten  so much fun! jump on the bwagon  is so wth the  ride!
Got the book Saturday mng (one copy f me one copy f my 7-year old) Immediately we sat on the couch  began to read Wh a shter attention span my son would get up play games watch tv but would  ultimately lug his book around the house I didn't get off the couch till  nearly sunset I then stayed up most of the night  fally fished  sunday afternoonConsiderg that my husb was leavg f a 7-day  busess trip on Sunday  my son  I virtually igned him should say  somethg Yes my friends 's THAT good I am completely blown away   almost weepy when I fished the book because I know 'll be months   months till the next stallationIn the meantime when i get home from  wk i'll be re-readg my fave sections  should susta me f a  whileJK Rowlg is a master!
At first I had doubts that this was gog to be as good as the first three but I was wrong JK Rowlg has the same amusg hum  sharp turns everywhere The same old characters are growg up like they should Harry Potter won't stay eleven years fever He's experiencg feelgs  real teenagers feel  so are Ron  Hermione Ron's brothers Fred   Gege add mischievous hum as well as a ltle mystery I thought the  new characters were very igal  teracted well wh the old  characters JK Rowlg has the reader suspectg everyone of everythg  The one dference I noticed between this fourth book  the first three  was the seriousness It's darker  me tragic which I thk is a part  of Harry becomg older This book has everythg: hr mystery  fantasy hum a b of teen romance  touches on a lot of issues like  prejudice
Wow! I can't believe that I'm the first person to review this book Do I ever feel special! Anyway I absolutely loved this book It was far far better than any of the previous Harry Potter books -- which were wonderful   their own right I thk that I can relate better to the characters  because they're closer to my own age now This book seemed to break from  the fmula set up  the previous three It is a b darker than the  others  a tad confusg too It was also much longer than the previous  Harry Potter books  full of details I'm dyg to know what will happen  between Hermione  Ron  the future! And was dissappoted that my  favoure m character Penelope Clearwater (Percy's girlfriend) was  absent Well  was a very enjoyable book  I would reccomend  to  Harry Potter fans  fans of fantasy of all ages
I enjoyed this book very much  Although I was surprised by 's length (over 700 pages) the sty was so engagg that I fished  wh a dayIf you like the other Harry Potter books I thk you will like this  one too  There's a lot of the usual action (Quiddch magical creatures  sneakg around) though most of the sty takes place outside the  classroom  There were several plot twists that I did not see comg at all  -  fact I was floed by the bad guy's identy this timeI  particulary liked that Harry is growg up  teractg me equally  wh adults  He has developed confidence  behaves less like a victim  wh his enemies  Maybe because of this Harry sees the people around him  me clearly  This book gives a lot of sight to the m characters  If you've ever wondered why Neville is beg raised by his grmother why  Mr Weasley doesn't make me money why Hagrid is so tall  why nobody  sticks up f the house elves - this book is f youOne thg that  annoyed me was the explanation f pronouncg &quotHermione&quot  I  suppose the auth was respondg to numerous questions but  seemed  contrived  did not flow well  the styGet ready f a fun read  Make sure you have a large chunk of free time befe you start this book  though because you will not want to put  down
The fourth book  the Harry Potter series contues the tradion of excellence set by the auth  her previous books  This book is an outstg example of lerature perfect f all ages I highly recommend  this book along wh the other three  the series
This book was great!  I bought   couldn't stop readg   There are surprises at every chapter  you learn a couple of thgs about You-Know-Who(Voldemt)  Dumbelde  Harry Potter!  You HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!
this book is so amazg  the first part  tells how harry has a dream  wakes up to fd his scar burng  his trunk open wh everythg   he needs f school the up comg year Black had sent this stuff to him  because he knew harry'd aunt  uncle wouldn't but thats all i want to  tell u because i don't want to give  away!
i thk this is the best Harry Potter book yet At first  foces on a murder that is terestg Then u fd out what Voldermt  You-Know-Who looks like as a snake this is a very good book
Every new Harry Potter book has managed the neat trick of beg better me volvg  me excg than the one befe but I didn't thk JK Rowlg could possibly top &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot this time  around  Boy was I wrong!  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot takes the series  to whole new realms of the sister shockg  heartbreakg all  while stayg true to the series  the characters we all know  love so  well by now  It's all funny true  completely (no pun tended)  spellbdgThe last 200 pages  so of this book shocked terried   disturbed me  left me exhausted thrilled fully satisfied  yet  hungrier than ever to see what the auth has  ste f Books 5 6   7!  She knows where she's gog  I predict she'll keep us hangg on  every wd along the way  These books don't deserve to be slapped wh the  demeang label of &quotchildren's books&quot -- take  from a  31-year-old wh a BA  English L these are LITERATURE  Any adult who  still considers himself &quotabove such thgs&quot is missg out
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is the best book ever that JK Rowlg wrote Though the book was long I read   a day  a half I loved all what happened JK Rowlg wres the best books ever! I  suggest that a lot of you people  the wld get this book  read  f  yourself
I just completed this book  already cannot wa f the next one This may sound strange comg from someone my age-you see i am 34 yrs old But this auth is an exceptional wrer  is able to entrance even the  oldest of the young  I recommend  f any reader who loves  a good  sty  Parents--buy this book f your children heck buy  f  yourselves!
The underdog Harry Potter  off  runng  this new fantasy adventure  I highly recommend this to both adults  kids although 's NOT que up to par wh the previous adventures  Still  sure beats  gog to silly summer movies like THE PATRIOT MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2   SCARRY MOVIE
Fahful readers of Harry Potter will not be disappoted  the latest stallation of this series  I started readg Saturday eveng  fished late Sunday mng (I did sleep  between!)  Rowlg packs all  kds of great  magical happengs  the Goblet of Fire -- new  characters new magical creatures the return of old friends  enemies   much much me The sty is left me open at the end than  the  three previous sty  This of course make me already anxious f book 5!  I would recommend these books to kids of all ages -- 9 to 99  I grew up  readg tons of kids books  while I was never to fantasy books my  mom (an elementary school librarian) suggested I give The Scerer's Stone  a try  I haven't looked back sce  I hope everyone else enjoys book 4 as  much as I did!
In my opion the best of the series Very high praise deed It is an excellent book  the fact that I am 14  wrg this on a supposedly kids book surprizes even me It is a great book f both kids  adults  End of sty
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire chroniclg the fourth year  Harry's le at the Hogwarts school of magic has followed the trend of the other books  the series: they get better not wse  The character that  dies wasn't really maj befe this book  neher was Harry's crush  (although both of them had been mentioned me than once  as Mrs  Rowlg said &quotcareful readers of book three will know the  girl&quot)  I didn't thk the begng of the book was only okay but   got much better  Fans of the series won't be disappoted  the book  is understable to first-timers as well  Anyway 's a great book   you should all buy  now
Okay okay yes I am a ltle b old to be readg children's books As a English lerature student you would thk I'd be readg materials of another nature But ever sce the first novel I have fallen  love wh  the adventures of Harry Potter Ron Weasly  Hermion Granger I fd each   every book as charmg  entertag as the previous one  this  fourth stallment by JK Rowlg is no exception!  The adventures of  Harry Potter are anythg but dull  HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE  I read   one night (all 734pgs)  I can assure that you will not be  disappoted!  This novel only makes me me anxious f Steven  Speilberg's movie! Farewell Muggles  happy readg!
The fourth Harry Potter book is the best so far wh over 700 pages Even f the fastest readers  should take them over 5 hours(i read my copy from Amazon  10 hours)  The plot is well based  the que well done  I personally love the book  It will defly be  my top 10  Startg  out wh a well based begg  is perfectly presented to keep the reader  wonder whats around the cner makg  very hard to stop readg  It  should give anyone a good read
Wow!  I have been a Harry Potter fan from the start  I am so exced to be able to get the new one!  Even tho  is 750 pages long  is just extra excement all throughout!  Geesh I cannot believe the fourth book is  out already!
Hard-pressed not to reveal imptant plot pots I'll simply say Rowlg has done  aga! I often wonder how this woman fabricated the entire wonderful wizard wld  contues to add such fascatg charmg   scary details A few thoughts I had while devourg the book  8 hours: 1)  Relationships between the three Hogwarts friends contue to develop No  longer are Hermione  Ron static Harry sidekicks They have agendas   struggles of their own I got to know Ron a lot better this time around 2)  Although Harry is special he is not vcible  fallible This endears  me him to me a hero wh vulnerabilies 3) Vol- er He Who Must Not  Be Named is not the prostrate weak character I once thought him to be The  last 50 pages  so are truly terryg After fishg the last page I  was hried to see that I had chewed most of my nails off A few tears  were shed too But now I'm gettg to spoiler terry so I'll end by  sayg that as Harry marks the days until the next school year begs I'm  crossg them off until Book #5 arrives!
This book was wth the wa! Clues to the past about Harry's Parents death &amp the mysterious Voldemt that were threaded through the first three books contue  the fourth I can't wa f book 5!
Those are two wds that clearly capture the feelg of&quotHarry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire&quot JK Rowlg does apurely magnicent job  this 4th stallment of The Harry Potter series  Where shall I began Ah the basis f any good novel the plot!

I thk Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is one of the most novative  terestg Harry Potter books yet  I got my copy yesterday mng at  10:00  fished all 734 pages this afternoon!  JK Rowlg really  wres fantastic books I like how she throws  details someone might  not pay attention to that actually play a big role  tellg the sty   makes  me terestg  makes you pay me attention The way she  twists the plots around  her choice use of wds are truly  &quotmagical&quot! Ms Rowlg develops the characters so well you eher  grow a strong likg  dislikg towards them  made me feel like I  was right there wh them I could feel Harry's loathg towards the  Slyther house (especially Draco Malfoy  Profess Snape)  I could  feel Hermione's joy at accomplishg a pretty big goal at the end of the  sty  One of the most terestg parts of the book was meetg students  from other wizardg schools I will not say much me f fear of  rug the book except that the last half of the book is very shockg   que unexpected   anyone has not read previous Harry Potter books   wants to start wh the most recent I strongly advise agast   You  MUST read them  numerical der to get the full experience as I said  befe the auth sprkles ltles details throughout all four of the  books that are necessary to tell the whole sty There is really only one  wd to describe Harry Potter  his friends: unfgettable
Beware  The book is charmed!  Obviously covered  an ENTHRALL spell Wonderful 700+ pages JK Rowlg's best yet!
This book is DEFINATLY the best  the Harry Potter series  probably one of the best books I've ever read  It's really really excg  adverturous wh lots of twists  It helps  you've read the oter tree  but  you haven't oh well  You have GOT to read this book  It's 734  pages  I couldn't stop readg   I read   two days
The newest stallment to the Potter stution is a much me serious  adult venture than any of the previous novels as may be immediately evident by s greater length  The protagonist's adventures have a much  less trivial tone as he is fced to confront issues far too dficult f  many juvenile readers to comprehend whout assistance  This is not  however detrimental to the series as  appears to be takg a turn  a  me epic dimension which will be greatly appreciated by an older audience  Rowlgs demomstrates a much me polished technical skill here too  employg a vocabulary that will seem  some places impossible to young  readers but beneficial to a complicated plot  Rowlg herself cannot help  pokg fun at some of the attention her book has received (ie an  annoyg newsrepter named Ra Skeeter wh a hab of twistg wds to  su her own purpose) but the effect is a book wh many me dimensions   fully fmed characters  In essence this book appears to be a  watershed f the series is now divergg from s igal audience   hts at an even darker sequal  My one complat would be the rather slow  begng which seems to serve very ltle purpose  terms of the general  plot save to fulfill the necessary Quiddich quota f the novel
They just keep gettg better J K Rowlg has gone above  beyond her first three books  Her creativy is amazg  The Triwizard Tournament was fun to read about along wh the Wld Cup  I enjoy Rowlg's wrg  very much I can't wa f the next book!
I am a very determed reader lovg everythg ever prted This latest book Number FOUR has thrilled me to no end I couldn't put  down  I now eagerly awa the next one It'll be a long wa I don't dare give  anythg away but #4 is gog to shock you  you won't be able to put   down This book is now my fave of any fiction wk I've ever read  Thanks Ms Rowlg I love your stuff!
WOW! This book was great! If you liked the others I no you'll enjoy this one! It was sooo good! Any true Harry Potter fan would love this book! Well to tell ya the truth I'm sure even people who arn't the biggest fans of Harry Potter would like this book! It was really great! My advise would be  to go buy this book  the other 3! ( u don't already have them!)
I started readg the book the second I recieved   couldn't but  down until i fished  It not only started to tie up the loose ends of the first books( like what the Weasley brothers are always explodg  their  room f example) but somehow  manages to keep you on the edge of your seat  f all 730 odd pages The only problem is the year wa until the fth  book will hopefully be released
I received my copy of The Goblet of Fire yesterday at 2:30  the afternoon  I fished  by 12:30 today  In my opion this is *the* most imptant book  the Harry Potter series so far  Not only do all of the  maj characters go through great changes  beg to show signs of  matury but many of the ltle questions that present themselves  the  first three books are answered  I'm not tryg to give away the plot but   you are a Harry Potter fan you cannot miss this book because  sets up  the senario f all to come!  There is everythg imagable:  secrets  dragons danger comedy!  This may be a 734 page book but  is an  amazgly fast read  keeps you terested from cover to cover  A MUST  READ!
To thk that kids will be able to read this Bible of a children's book! Havg just read   under a day the latest Harry Potter book is pure rubbish at best Leave  to JK Rowlg to rip off ideas  give  a  name Here's to me igal wrg!
I have read all of the harry Potter books  have enjoyed them all However after I fished readg &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot I was left fellg like  was not done It felt as though there  had been somethg lackg from the sty I was expectg somethg me  from the very hyped book After all the terviews letters  articles I  was expectg somethg drastic to happen Yes one thg drastic happened  but all the books have been leadg up to that   was not a surprise I  thk that while the book is very good the hype made my experience readg   less enjoy able Still 's the 4th book so you have just got to read  
I must say that I enjoyed havg the book delivered to me first thg saturday mng  I sat right down  started readg  However I was disapoted that JK Rowlg felt the need to go to background detail on  what happened  the first three books  If someone is buyg this book   is very likely that they have already read the previous three  know  them fairly well  Therefe readg a summary of the plot is unnecessary   annoygBut other than an occasional tendency to go to  summaries   details of the first three books   is an terestg plot  well-wren  i wasn't able to put  down  I started readg Saturday  at noon  kept gog to Sunday mngIt contues right where the  third left off  has suations   that would never have happened   the first three  As I was readg  I noticed a wd repeated that I  feel is appropriate to put  a book geared towards children  She uses  the wd 'Damn' several times both by Harry  his friends  by Arthur  Weasley the father of of one of his friendsOther than those few  thgs  is a remarkable book  defely wth readg
but still a great summer read  I happed to be down wh the flu this weekend enablg me to read the entire 700+ pages book already  Beg an adult my fascation wh the Harry Potter series is driven by pure  childish delight a wonderful means of re-stimulatg my imagation  This  fourth stallment while enjoyable was not  my opion que as magical  as the first three  Much of the wrg appears to be devoted toward  settg the stage f the fal istallments rather than devoted toward the  adventure self almost overshadowg the plot of this specic book  Addionally I did not bond wh any of the new characters troduced -  possibly because there were so many that they could not be presented as  fully   depth as those  earlier booksDespe these cricisms  I did fd  to be an enjoyable read  am still happily lookg fward  to the next stallment  I recommend  to others maly as there is much  fmaon that will certaly be needed  der to underst   appreciate those yet to come  Try to read  through the eyes of your 9  year old self  enjoy!
This was absolutely the best Harry Potter book yet  It was very long but wth  to read every page  This book has everythg you could ever ask f  a good sty  Mystery suspense hum  even a b of romance  This book is so much me detailed than the first three  has such a  wonderful yet complex plot I could hardly beleive that JK Rowlg had  outdone herself when I was fished  I never could have predicted the  endg (kd of sad  you ask me)  If I could give this book a million  stars I would but the lim is five  I am only 13  can't really  compare this book to other great thgs people have read  their adult  years but I can assure you this is the best book I have ever read  I  don't want to give too much away but this book had me hooked from the  first chapter about the Riddle House all the way through to the end of the  Triwizard Tournament  If I say any me I will spoil the best book  the  wld  Go read ! Unless you're too much of a muggle of course
The magic is defely back! This was wth readg constantly over the last 48 hours  Though Rowlg had said that Harry was gog to be growg up I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the sty's content  style reflected that  The duel between Voldemt  Harry was absolutely  spectacular as well  It was also great to learn about magic from other  countries About the only disappotg part was that the Quiddch Wld  Cup didn't last long enough! Dark magic is strongly afoot by the end   the face-off between Dumblede  Fudgewell  makes me say me  than ever that I can't wa f the next one!
I spent all day Saturday readg this book from cover to cover The ma characters are fourteen now  are growg up  actg their age This book deals wh a lot of adult issues like prejudice  jealousy whout beg heavy-hed The sty self is grippg  satisfygly scary  the endg will leave you anxious f book five
Thank you Ms Rowlg  Scholastic Books f brgg the wld of books to the level of music movies  other icons of popular culture Now kids are buyg books wh as much enthusiasm as they have been buyg toys  a CD's!Thank you thank you thank you!
I had wanted to sav this book  make  last Unftunately I couldn't put  down (This made my husb happy as he is next  le to read ) It made me laugh cry  grip the pages JK Rowlg is an  credible sty teller  I can't wa f the next bookAnother auth  I would recommend to older children  adults who like Harry Potter is  Philip Pullman  The third book  his series &quotHis Dark  Materials&quot is due out  November
Never underestimate Rowlg's abily to help put her readers to the wld of young Harry Potter this latest tale of his adventures is great!When I first set eyes on the book the size alone was enough to make me want   Can you image over 700 pages of Harry Potter awesome!  The length of the book doesn't seem to daunt any of s readers whom I  have met  I'm sure many children  adults will cruise through the book   a day  twoThe only question that I have now is: When will the next  book be comg out?  I've had my Potter fix f now but I'm sure to beg  gog through whdrawals aga soon
Oh man that was good I have to wa a year until another one comes out aga? Once aga the auth has cleverly woven the sty's plot strs together The end where Voldemt (sry)  Wmtail    Sry I can't  give  away    was really creepy It took me a while to figure out what  Ra Skeeter really was I never would have guessed   not f the  picture on the last chapter That was a very good book!
At almost 750 pages Goblet is bigger  better than the first three Potter books JK Rowlg has masterfully set up her magical wld f the next three books to unfold Harry's sty  I can't wa f number 5  (Yes I fished this one  2 days)
Warng: Don't read this  you don't want part of the book spoiled If you liked the first three Harry Potters this one is even better  my opion You get to meet people from other magical schools see the rebirth  of Voldemt meet Sirius Black aga see the Quiddch Wld Cup   fally see a duel between Voldemt  Harry himself One can already  tell that  is this all imptant 4th book that lays the ground wk f  the rest of the series The book is preparg the reader f the ultimate  battle that is on the verge of comg This is kd of like  JRR  Tolkien's Ld of the Rgs between The Two Towers  The Return of the  Kg Rowlg similar to her other books is able to keep you lookg   the another direction  then at the end is able to trick you to another  surprise endg This book like Rowlg has said is defely a much  darker book however  is still wth the read My advice: try not to  read  too quickly because the 5th won't be comg f about another year  (so i hear)  the first read is always the best Sav every moment of  this great book
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was well wth the wa  The book lerally grips you from the very first page  I got  at 12:01 on Saturday mng  didn't put  down until I fished  at 5:35 AMHarry Ron  Hermione are  their fourth year at Hogwarts  Harry's  off to an excg start to the year as he attends the Quiddch Wld Cup  wh the Weasley family  Unftunately f Harry his fourth school year  is a year of problems  The shadow of Ld Voldemt (the most powerful  evil wizard  the wld) looms larger than ever  Despe this Harry  manages to live the le of a nmal wizard teen  Harry Ron  Hermione  beg to notice the oppose sex  The angst of tryg to fd someone to  take to the school dance is hilarious -- I lerally laughed out loud  Rowlg hles this tradional re of passage  a wonderful wayThe characterization  this book was excellent  Even m characters  are fleshed out well  However I must caution parents wh small children  that the book is somewhat darker  tone than the rest of the series  Four  people die  the course of the book  None of the deaths are explicly  shown  there is no gratuous violence but younger children may be  frightened  (The level of violence is comparable to that  CS Lewis'  Narnia series)I hope all of you will enjoy this book as much as I have  Happy readg --  here's hopg the rest of the series is just as good   not better!
I was enthralled from the begng A ltle shocked by the sudden Begng but the sty kept me gog just to learn the plot  I anticipated learng me about Sirius  Hogwarts And Hermoes idea f  SPEW kept me laughg all the way through And the way all the  characters wk together especially a twist wh Krumthe pro-quiddch  player  po Ron who is left to deal wh his jealousies of Harry This  Book tied f me wh the 3rd one My two faves now
Okay I'm ready to buy book 5 right now!  The Goblet of Fire contues the fun  frights of the Harry Potter series  Longer  somewhat darker  tone The Goblet of Fire kept me readg until the book was fished I  didn't want to put  down! I'm a kid that's 42 years old  I can't help  but enjoy this series
I startd to read the book   pulled me right   I didnt sleep  eat till i fished all 732 pages  It was full of unexpected turns  combg mystery fantisy  adventure all to one  I jut cant wa to  read the 5th one
I began readg the fourth Harry Potter as soon as FedEx delivered  Saturday mng  didn't put  down until 2:00 am Sunday mngExcellent!   The best Potter by far  Aga wonderfully drawn  characters exceptional descriptive wrg superb plot twists   despe publicy befe release surprises gale  I am a mother of  three but I have made  a practice to read the Potter books befe my  son who is 11 so we can discuss them  I can answer questions  I have  found that I enjoy them as much( maybe me) than he does  I can hardly  wa f number 5 to see what happens next!
Rowlg has done  aga wh another terric addion to the Harry Potter books  This book has everythg the other three books had that made them so delightful f children  adults  Highly recommended!
Well the gang is back at Hogwarts but no Quiddch this year!  Sneaky thgs are happeng on campus  new faces too!  But beware of pa  Harrys scar? You won't be able to put this one down!  Thanks JKR f makg this one longer  so packed full of excement! Can't wa f #5! My  whole family is beg taken over by Harry Fever!  The clfhanger at the  end of this one has my fgers achg to preder the next one! WOW!
I loved the book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  JK Rowlg left me hangg on to her every wd from suspense  Like the other three Harry Potter books Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a detailed mystery wh a suprisg endg I would recomend this book to anyone  searchg  f a magical adventure that will leave them wag f me  To anyone  who has read the other three books  the Harry Potter series I believe  that Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is my fave so far  Though I  will adm by far the longest!  To those who haven't read the Harry Potter  series the books are similar to those wrten by Roald Dahl  Eva  Ibbatson Also I would suggest readg the 1st 2nd  3rd Harry Potter  book befe readg the fourth  This would make Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire seem less confusg  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Begs wh Harry (a young wizard)spendg his summer holiday wh the  Dursleys (his aunt uncle  cous)  But soon he is off to his friend  Ron's house f a special treat  Soon Hary  Ron are off to there  magical school (Hogwarts)to fd a huge suprise f them  the other  students  As the school year rolls allong Harry  meets up wh many thgs  such asa Goblet of Fire a repter that really bugs them 3 imptant  tasks a complete disaster  maybe even a duel I really enjoyed these  events I LOVED Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire!
The fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series is deed pivotal  It shows the steady measured maturation of the characters that fans of the series have been promised sce the begng along wh the usual fun suspense  humEven the death  this book which auth Rowlg  seemed to believe was necessary to fully establish the evil nature of her  villa Voldemt was hled perfectly  Wh sadness tempered by fury   determation on the parts of all the heroesRowlg also shows us  some marvelous new glimpses of Harry's wld takg her carefully laid  foundation  addg to   We see not only Non-Brish wizards   wches but even Non-European  One might wonder how other countries will  respond to the contued threat of VoldemtThis is one of the first  books I've been lookg fward to  a great while that hasn't  disappoted me  the slightest  I fished the book  7 hours straight   then went back to reread my fave parts  It is a masterwk not of  children's lerature but of lerature  Wh this book JK Rowlg  establishes herself as not just a great styteller but a great wrer
This book was very dark much darker  scarier than any of the other  three  I would not recommend readg  to young children especially  befe bed  It put much me emphasis on Voldemt's old suppters the  Death Eaters than ever befe  We fd out who they were wh some  surprises  how some of them got out of gog to Azkaban  Many fd  themselves  an awkward posion when Voldemt is on the rise aga  The  first chapter is entirely focused on Voldemt  Harry is not metioned at  all  Secondly there were deaths  this book one which is a student at  Hogwarts  Through this book we come to better underst the suation  befe Voldemt's downfall the terr the chaos  the uncertaty of  not knowg who was on your side  who was really supptg the Dark  LdBut despe  perhaps because of that this book is  my  opion the best  the series  It is certaly the longest at 700+ pages  There is lots of laughs lots of venture  lots of hilarious  attempts at romance  Its not too mushy though don't wry  Its not all  dark  scary though  Harry goes to the Quiddich Wld Cup wh the  Weasleys he  Ron have an terestg time fdg dates f the Yule  Ball He Ron  Hermione have happy times hangg out  the common room   there's plenty of comic relief provided by Fred  Gege Weasley  There are lots of funny new characters too  An extremely paranoid new  Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher an annoygly nosy Daily Prophet  repter students from the other two school f Wizardry   Europe-Beaubaxtons  Durmstrang  a Wld Cup Quiddch player  love  wh Hermione I laughed out loud many times while readg this bookNo  book is perfect  though these are great I have a few problems  First of  all does everybody have a secret they never tell Harry?

It is amazg to see that children are lg up  down street cners at midnight to purchase an 800 page book  is unheard of All age groups are dyg to get their hs on yet another brilliant piece of lerature    is so very excg to see children this enthusiastic about readgNot only does this book provide a fun  imagative way to escape  from the every-day wld but  takes one to a place side them that may  not have been embraced f years Watch out MTV Harry is back!
Probably the best  the series Unlike the other books this one is darker puts Harry's le  a lot me dangerous suations  keeps us holdg our breath At 700 plus pages  is also longer wh a lot me  plot twists  new surprises
True to her wd JK Rowlgs did deed make this a darker book  The Goblet of Fire pulls you along from the begng but wh a me sister undertone than befe  Towards the end is que gruesome enough so that  children younger that 10 probably shouldn't read   All  all though I  thoughly enjoyed the book as I have done the previous three  My children   I all fought over who got to read  first - we all won so at one time  there were three bookmarks  the book
THis book was by far the best JK has ever wrten  Even though  was long  was easy to underst  we all got the message she was sendg through  In all of her books she made  seem like you were there but   this one you could actually SEE Harry's name flyg out of the Goblet of  Fire  you could feel how Harry felt so deeply about missg a parent  figure  This book made us realize the values of our le   was a  plane to adventure f kids  adults
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire has exceeded all of my expectations  is equal to  better than the first book which is not a very common thg to happen books I recommend startg the whole set over   fishg wh this last one because  makes every small detail  the  goblet of fire have much me meang I loved this book
I just fished readg The Goblet of Fire about ten mutes ago  is now 9:00pm  is whout a doubt the best book i have ever read  It  puts  just the right amount of adventure action hr drama   romance to turn out the most terestg book perhaps many will enjoy  I  got the book yesterday (saturday june 8)  have not put  down f  almost 36 hours  I hope anyone that reads this will read the book   enjoy  as much as i did  I would also recomend anyone wantg to read  this book read the other three otherwise  can be very confusg  I was  shocked to fd out Ce- no read the book to fd out who dies although i  was glad that  was no one immediatly close to Harry I thought the Goblet  of Fire was gog to have a much bigger role  the sty than  actually  did  I dont want to talk to much about the Triwizard Tournament  i might  get sued  somethg but JK Rowlg is one of the best wrers i have  ever read  i hope she keeps on wrg these books f a long time
I absolutely loved this book  When he was at the Quiddch Wld cup you knew that somethg was gog to happen  The book was very well planned  both excg  terryg at the end  You could never tell who was  bad  who was good I fished   less than three days that's how  good  was I couldn't put  down!
The book is very excg Though  starts off very bg  gets really goodjK rowlg defately still has   her to exce you but i feel that she is sta startg to run out of ideas but will still be able  to fish the seriesAt first you start to thk that the book is gog to  be really bg  you want to stop readg  but that onlty lasts like  30 pages Also  is surprisg that the last chapter is called the  begng Overall  is a very good book
Had to read this one twice befe I could comment It's great to catch up wh all our fave characters plus the new ones (I had a teacher wh an eye like Moody's) Do the elves need a union? Hermione to the rescue! Like  the teenagers they've become I fd myself eher cheerg f  yellg  at the characters especially durg the partnerg f the big Christmas  dance The Triwizard Tournament sequence cheatg  all was a real  roller-coaster rideespecially the endg! So what happens next? The book  ends wh lots of questions f Rowlgs to answer!
What a great book! From the moment I picked  up I couldn't stop readg  As is now the trademark of Harry Potter books The Goblet of Fire is full of twists  turns And like the rest of the books clues are given  slowly througthout until the end when all is revealed Usually this is fe  by me but this book was gigantic! 700+ pages is not somethg you want to  try to read  one stg even though there is always this urge to read  just to the next chapter to learn me of the trigug sty Other than  the hefty length of the book which might be unsuable f younger  readers The Goblet of Fire is magnicent All I'll say is that 's about  time that Harry started actg like he was gog through puberty Also  there were so many moments when I felt like screamg &quotGo Harry!&quot  (end of chp16)  when a tear would come to my eye (Hagrid  Maxime) So   you're a Harry Potter fan (who isn't these days?) get this book now! And   you aren't well get  anyway! The Goblet of Fire blows the other  three away
This is the fourth book  JK Rowlgs series   leaves you spellbound  Harry has to deal wh his usual demons but there is somethg me much me  I found the book fascatg  rivg  I kept readg until my eyes hurt  I still wanted me  What is  ste  f Harry Potter is anyone's guess until you read this wonderful fourth  stallment  What a great way to keep us entranced  the magic of Harry's  wld  always leaves us beggg f me!
This book is by far the most excg  terestg book  the Harry Potter series yet The way the book starts out tells the reader why Harry gets the spltg head pas  his scar is dferent from when  usually  starts out  his aunts  uncles house which makes  me terestg  One of the other events that happen is when Harry's name is chosen by the  Goblet of Fire  asks the question of how he got by the age le The  next thg thg that is neat about the book is when the spirs of the  people who Voldermt killed comes out of Voldermt's w causg a  sheild to block Harry from Voldermt  Another thg that I found  terestg is how so many people cludg me thought that someone else  was gog to be killed  never gave thought to the person who was killed  Overall this is my fave book  the series  I recommend  to  everyone
Well  arrived from Amazon at 8:55 am Saturday  I fished about 4:45  Well s at least as good (I'm 43  loved all of them)  Although  does deal wh dark themes  death  is still a posive   wonderful book  not too dark f thoughtful kids  The imagative  details contue to make me both laugh  shiver I'm sure that anyone who  appreciated the other books will not be disappoted
This may be hard to believe but JK Rowlg has outdone herself!One of the great joys of the Harry Potter series is that Rowlg has created a wld that is fully realized  has s own magical logic  By takg  Harry  his friends beyond Hogwarts's gates by troducg them to  wizards from other countries Rowlg has a whole new playground  which  to experimentHarry's fourth year at Hogwarts offers him an opptuny  to meet credible new challenges  learn a ton of new magic skills  While the first three HP volumes were excg  full of adventure this  fourth volume is truly thrillg!  As Harry faces these new  at times  very scary challenges he learns me about the histy of Ld Voldemt   the bad old days when Voldemt was at the height of his powersIn  addion Harry  his pals are growg up  on one occasion must attend  an event wh a fmal date -- heavens that's a challenge right there!  What will they do?  Through  all they come to underst each other  even better  the bonds of their friendships strengthen  Harry faces a  tremendous challenge at the end of the book  we come to fully realize  the brilliance  compassion of Profess Dumblede As always Rowlg  skillfully weaves  a strong sense of fair play  tolerance f others  throughout this complex  plot twistg taleIf you enjoyed the first  3 volumes then hang onto your hat -- this is the best of the bunch!  I  read the first 3 books myself  then aloud to my niece  nephew --   I can honestly say that HP  The Goblet of Fire is better than the other  three combed!  BRAVO JK Rowlg -- BRAVO!  PS  Five stars doesn't do  this justice!
I have been wag f this book f a year   was defely wth the wa  All the fave people were back  some addional new ones I  especially liked the addion of Ron's older brothers I didn't like   as well as the other books though It isn't que as funny as the  previous ones It is a ltle darker than the previous books  has a  ltle me &quotlanguage&quot which might stop parents of small children  from readg  to them  But the &quotlanguage&quot isn't really that  big of a deal to me  But then I am 13Although the book is about 700  pages I was glad It gave me me to read  me details to enjoy   Can't wa until the next one comes out!
Like many many many other Muggles befe me I have thoughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series  I never seriously believed that as an adult I could become totally transfixed by a novel  the 'children' genreUntil  nowI ploughed through this latest pivotal stallment  the series  although  does weigh  at an impressive 734 pages  a ltle over one  day  It was that magical  This is one of the most expertly woven novels I  have ever read  Whether you are a child  a child at heart this  spellbdg (no pun tended) novel will leave you breathless  beggg  f me  When does number 5 come out?
The fourth ( extremely hefty) Harry Potter adventure is a wdmagical!  The tricately plotted sty sparkles wh charmhum  alternatg danger  delight  Wh her usual light wty style Rowlg brgs her lovable characters to a very eventful fourth year at Hogwarts complete wh colful new spells  experiments cracklg House rivalries exotic feign magic students  professs a somewhat-paranoid new Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher  the glter  danger of a prestigious old tournament - not to mention discoveries of the existence of the oppose sex!  Filled wh plenty of sly hum emotion  brilliant magic (both leral  lerary) 'Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire' tops even the superb first three stallments  the seriesIt's a book to devour  two days to sav over two weeks  to cherish fever
I thk these books exemply chidrens lives today The stages that Harry Potter is gog through as he gets older through the series of books is somethg children today have not seen  a long time somethg magical  trestg telectually stimulatg  not todays typical raunchy  violence This requires imagation!  Not only does  paeallel the  evolution of childrens lives but adults can relate to there childhood  experienceses  use this as a channel of communication wh their  children These books are a se f se eyes!
Whew just fished  While good toooo long  I hopeMs Rowlg does not fall to the trap of too many other auths(Kg Clancy et al)  feel that their books have to be long to be good Also this should not be marketed to kids under 8 years of age Too violent  too dark
Havg loved the first 3 volumes of Harry Potter  his escapades this book was eagerly awaed  of course welcomed when  arrived on Saturday afternoon It is a keeper  As the mom  a household wh three  teenaged daughters (the youngest is 15)  the first one to read the  book I can guarantee that the rest of our family will feel as I did  Our  15 year old is holdg off because she feels that once she fishes the  book she will have too long to wa f volume 5  another daughter has  too much school wk at the moment to beg  As f me I fished the book   a day  now I have another year to wa f the next book so maybe my  15 year old has the right idea!  Regardless  is a great read f all!
Well I just fnished readg   WOW 's good  I enjoyed every mute of   However I don't know   is a good book f children  There are alot of scary scenes   cludg a couple of ttures  the  deaths of me than one promant character  However f an adult is is  spectacular readg  It kept me on the edge of my seat  I could not  put  down untill I was done
As one of the legion of adult  fans I can only say that at  733  a half pages the book is still too sht!  If  the very youngest Potter addicts fd their attention flaggg befe they get to the end they may just  have to grow to this tale  Harry  his friends add puppy love   polical activism to their usual preoccupations as they experience another  year of magic  mayhem at Hogwart's School of Wchcraft  Wizardry  As promised death takes place on stage but  as Harry grows older  me  self reliant the atmosphere seems less nightmarish despe the me  aggressive villay  Rowlg's sense of hum gets full play as well  At one pot as the non-magical Dursley family tries to cope wh the  wizardg  Weasleys who have not que managed to materialize  their  livg room I had to put the book down  fish laughg  I am  really enjoyg this series  I can't wa to fd out what happens next
I love the Harry Potter series  that defately extends to Book Four! It is me grown up than the other books  much darker so be prepared The plot is defately thickeng f Harry  his friends  the sty  (though very long don't let  scare you away!) is completely captivatg  I couldn't put  down! I would reccomend this splendid series especially  this book to one  all
It was good shockg sad hrg   was a revelation Wth the money  time! And a tear will be shed It puts Azakaban to shame! The new sterments  rooms  monsters  that zg that Rowlg always has
&quotAMAZING!&quot There is simply no other wd to describe this book! It was shipped to my grmother's house on July 8 as promised I picked  up July 9 around noon  immediately started to read By 10:30 pm that night I was 2/3 of the way through I fished the remag chapters the  next mng  an hour The book is that good Now I am a 15 year old  soon-to-be juni  high school  I can read along wh the best of  them In juni high I was readg Stebeck Austen  Dickens que  easily Readg has always been fun f me However though I have been  readg advanced material f ages now I simply can't get over how GOOD  these Harry Potter books are! They seem to get better wh each new  release  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is no  exception As alwasy &quotthe Goblet&quot leaves us yearng f  me I already awa the release of Harry Potter book #5 Everyone should  read these books adults  children alike  all the ages  between as  well JK Rowlg is a genius  her Harry Potter books deserve a spot  on the shelf wh such other timeless classic fantasies as CS Lewis'  &quotChronicles&quot  JRR Tolkien's &quotThe Hobb&quot   &quotLd of the Rgs&quot triology Rowlg's Harry Potter books are  spiration to those who have always dreamed of success  the wrg  wld as well as simply pure fun to those who just want to read
A great book that has not only kept up wh the previous books but also set future tracks f the upcomg books  A wonderful sty that will show anybody that they can do anythg  I got the book  read  the firt day!  It was phenomenal  Rowlgs has done  aga showg kids  everywhere to believe  read  From her imagation to her outstg  style  I hope everybody enjoys this book as much as i did!
Well I bought the book at midnight  was wonderg  I would be disappoted sce I had such high hopes f this book  Ms Rowlg  such a huge task to compete wh wh her other outstg books  Well  less than 48 hours later I am here to say that the book lives up to the  expectationsI couldn't put  down  All the tras that made the other  books so good are all here  to add to  I must say that the endg  makes you want to have the next book yesterday  I don't want to give away  any of the sty I'll just say that I can't wa f the next Harry Potter  to arrive  stes  I'll be wag  le aga to have my copy at  12:01am  And to all the people that say this is a children's bookthis  is a 31 year old child that loves Harry Potter
The 4th book  the Harry Potter series is brilliant! It keeps you guessg right to the end A must f all Harry Potter fans
I bought the book on saturday at 12:01 am  was up until4:30 readg  This is defely my fave Harry Potter bookThe end took me totally by surprise
Wow!  Another excellent wk of MsRowlg  Though the firstchapter seems me as a prologue  serves as an excellent begngpot f the by far longest book  the series  I won't give away any plot details except that after many hours of readg rums none of them predicted any of the ma pots of this book  Expect to be pleasantly surprised by new characters events  suations  The endg of the book comes as a real shock  I don't thk anyone can predict what kd of surprise MsRowlg has f us  future books except that they will certaly get darker  Don't take this endg under the covers wh a flashlight at night  A wonderful book nevertheless full of lerature's greatest majs--comedy  tragedy
Although I am not done readg &quotHarry Potter  theGoblet of Fire&quot almost everyone can appreciate this book It hasgreat stywrg produced by the now legendary JK Rowlg Harry Potter is startg his fourth year at Hogwarts Wizardg School  is maturg gradually Harry is also gog to the Internation Quiddch Cup wh his dear friend Ron  Hermione It seems that JK Rowlg is tryg to also mature the book not just Harry  company There is me constant swearg like the occasional &quotdamn&quot  &quothell&quot Nothg too big to wry about but parents wh very young children to take notice of this Along wh swearg the Harry Potter series seems to be takg a lot me time divulgg to the Dark Arts JK Rowlg has troduced us to many new people that we only know very ltle of (Charlie &amp Bill Wealsey f example)  she does  wh grace The character development is flawless &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is defely the best  obviously longest of all the Harry Potter books  Defely wth gog to the book ste f
This book is the best of the four published so far supptedby the strongest plot yet  many quick turns to the sty whichthrows you off-balance It still retas most of the old elements  troduces some new ones as well The new charcters are very well implamented makg you feel like they've been  the seris all along Rowlg as usual has tried to wre this book to the very highest stard possible   shows  If you had any doubts gettg &quotHarry Potter  the goblet of fire&quot this article should have squashed them all
JK Rowlg did not disappot this adult reader wh her much-anticipated new book  I received  Saturday afternoon  could not put  down  until fishg on Sunday afternoon!  As predicted this book is much  darker than the previous three -- Harry's challenges have become me  complex  plotles me sister  The familiar characters that  surround him also reveal themselves me fully  I was once aga  captivated by Rowlg's tricate plot surprise twists  hum  Can't  wa f the next one!
Die hard fans of Harry Potter as well as newcomers to the wld of Hogwarts  Muggles will fd this book equallg charmg  amazg  It's credible anytime when you have ten year olds gobblg a  700+ page  book up like kids as   were a sht sty  Rowlg's wrg has only  gotten better: her style has just enough background so that even  you  have not read the other books you can enjoy this one  Wonderful I would  highly reccomend  to anyone who has any &quotreserves&quot about    Become part of the Harry Potter phenomona :)
Harry Potter like his readers is growg up Although vividly named cy  Quiddch still hold his attention other me adult concerns are loomg At first the book seems loose the Quiddch Wld Cup an almost perfuncty chapter notable only f s aftermath Ms Rowlg seems also  to be takg aim at some obvious targets  the prospect of a polically  crect Harry Potter looms Luckily the chronicles of Harry ( the  imagation of Ms Rowlg) are as ventive as ever wh every obvious  target missed  a style that reaches a wonderful  broodg  fale This book ends wh threats not only to Harry but the entire wld  he habs we can only hope that the next year will be enough f him   his readers to prepare
This book was REALLY good It had a lot of action I can't pick my fave part!  I recommend  to anyone who likes fantasy books
If one ever ss  wonders just what  is that makes a great film st out from other movies what makes games remembered where others are fgotten  what distguishes superb sties from the rest of the books  on the shelf they will hear many dferent reasons  concoct their own   Some will suggest that the key gredients are thgs like havg a certa  amount of plot an terestg gameplay believable characters wrg  that is easy to comprehend an unpredictable roller coaster of mystery   an entertag wty humYet while great movies/games/books ( any  other fms of such media) will tend to have as many of these key  gredients as possible  isn't *any* of these that make them st above  the rest  And while a combation of many of these facts marks to rare   uncommon talent great wk is defely me than the sum of the  partsThe Harry Potter series is somethg que special  When you read   you know  isn't just the characters settg  atmosphere that are  magical  It is the *sty* that takes all of those key characteristics  (characters wh frightengly realistic depth of personaly   believable motivations a sophisticated yet followable plotle a settg  so picturesque  could have been pated on a canvas delightful hum)   crafts them to a very deliberately designed experience  Throughout  the series  is very clear to the reader that Rowlg knew exactly what  she was dog  exactly how she wanted them to feelWhile the first  three books tended to beckon the reader's feelgs to the desired effect  The Goblet of Fire thrusts the reader through subtle combations of  stronger  me mature emotions that Rowlg describes  bright hues of  vivid detail  The fourth book has a ntier grtier feel throughout that  remds you the characters are growg up slowly but surely  You open this  book almost twice the size of the others expectg a heavierread  You  come away  the end almost feelg a heavier burden on your soul  Whether  you are currently around Harry's age  remiscg about when you were  you know how he feels throughout even the thickest of his dealsAnd  f those who ever wonder just what the big fuss is about this is one of  the better series where  is &quotwth the time to fd out&quot
This book was great  was just as good as the other ones  as JK Rowlg contues to wre the books keep gettg better  better  I like how at the end  leaves ya hangg anticipatg the next book   was very good
It's been a long tough wa sce the 3rd book  JK Rowlg's &quotHarry Potter&quot series came out but readg this newest stallment has been such a wonderful treat  I'm constantly amazed by the imagation  fun that Rowlg condures up f her sties  Yes this  book is much much longer than the previous three but don't be timidated  by   If anythg the added length extends the pleasure of readg   I'd hoped to be able to spread out my readg of this book but I'm done  already  I wish I was back  the middle of  stomach full of  butterflies hopg Harry Ron  Hermione (Her-my-oh-nee I'd been  pronouncg  wrong  my head) would make  out ok hopg Snape   Draco Malfoy would be squashed by some rom monster that had escaped from  Hagrid's pen tryg to figure out who the hidden bad-guy is Absolutely  love these books  Defely classics that I'll read to my kids someday  Can't wa till Harry Potter V!
Harry Potter will stir your imagattion to s fullest content wh ideas  thoughts you may have never came up wh otherwise The uniqeness of the book carries  to a categy of s own Harry goes through his usual  sets of problems to get himself out of but befe he does he gets to  even me trouble He always shows great quales of a human beg beg  brave  courageous  almost never selfish As a fourteen year old he  has dferent pries than adults but keeps a level head even about some  romance that could be volved This book is wth the 25 dollars so w/  Amazon's price of 15 dollars s a fd that you couldnt pass up The  prefect gt f anyone who doesn't already have  espically yourself  Enjoy!

The book Goblet of Fire has surprises at every cner It is not what you expect  is very hard to predict the end of this Harry Potter book This book is probably the climax of the Harry Potter series  MUST be read You will be missg a lot  you don't read this book
JK Rowlg has wrten another wonderful addion to her Harry Potter series  The book though considerably longer than any of s predecesss  reads just as quickly  holds the reader's attention just as well  I  really enjoyed this book  was sry to see  end  I can't wa f the  next one!  F those who have not yet started the series be sure to read  the books  der as each builds on the previous sty
In this book JKRowlg starts out like a tra slow But as she goes farther she picks up speed to the pot where 's unable to be put down As you progress  the book you meet new characters along wh old ones like Ld Voldemt JK Rowlg has a knack f puttg you  the book  She is able to make you the extra character under an visibily cloak  But you are also a part of Harry's md  body If you haven't read this  bood yet you are missg out on ideas from your wildest dreams JK  Rowlg I salute you! Congradulations on a wonderful book release As a  part of fans I say that we are ready f book 5
I was delighted by how well this book flows from book three Many sequles can be picked up  understood whout readg the previous books  a series However I thk  would be dicult to do that wh this one  This is not a negative thg f this book  my opion  Previous  fmation  characters a few even that we haven't sce sce book  one add a great deal to the the feelg of this book makg  feel me  realistic  Very fun  excg book!  Yes I waed a hour   le  the third ste I looked at  The first two were sold out!
This book was so good It only took me 15 days to read  because I didn't put  down I loved ! It was one of the best books I've read I recommend this book to anyone  everyone!
Welcome back to Hogwarts where the extradary is par f the course  the unexpected would be expected -  we were clever enough to image thgs that happen past our wildest dreamsHarry Ron  Hermione  (her-MY-oh-nee) are 14  are back f their 4th year at Hogwarts School  of Wizardry  There is another Defense from the Dark Arts profess  (&quotWe do seem to run through them&quot Dumblede has remarked)  Hagrid is still teachg Care of Magical Creatures which is runng to  me um nerestg (as Hagrid might say) creatures than flobberwms  Percy has graduated but Fred  Gege are still not livg up to his  prefectial stardsThere is no Quiddch this year but we do get  the chance of a letime prime seats f the Wld Quiddch Cup  In  place of spts there are me classes  a ball  who will be gog  wh whom?Ld Voldemt is still tryg to return   is a  terryg  somberg prospect  At one pot someone tries to  recapture f Harry the aura of the time befe Ld Voldemt's defeat  He succeeds  One of the scariest thgs you realize is that you never  knew who was on the Dark Side  who wasn't  Would  be that way aga  after Ld Voldemt's return?  Is  that way now when You-Know-Who might  be on the rise?  Who is on what side?We meet creatures we have seen  befe like grdylows  see some new ones  (The wizardg wld is  fascatgly filled wh creatures  you see why a student would be  required to take 7 years of Care of Magical Creatures)  We meet new people   see old people  a dferent light  Harry  Ron  Hermione are  growg up  Thgs may not be so black  whe anymeAll  all  every page of this 700+ page book is wth turng  Send your owl out  today wh an der f a copy by return post  If you could see a  wizardg picture of the people who have read the book we'd all be wavg  wildly at you cheerg  then gog off to start on our rereadgyou cheerg  then gog off to start on our rereadg
I have read all of the Harry Potter books  they keep gettg better In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the action takes place quicker than  the previous books In readg this book we learn histies of many of the  characters as well as brgg them back from the previous books JK  Rowlg does a fe job  makg the reader feel they are at The Quiddch  cup  at Hogwarts meetg the students from two other magical schools  Like  the other books we see how imptant  is that we have our  friends believe  us  we believe  them Like  real le Harry Ron   Hermione have some arguments  grow stronger together The Goblet of  Fire does have some scary  emotional scenes but no stronger than  television cartoons The feelgs the reader have f the characters show  how much they mean to us Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a  wonderful book  like the Wizard of OZ Harry Potter will be wh us f  ever
I always chuckle when I see the &quotreadg level&quot listed f the Harry Potter series I am almost 40  was as anxious as any of Rowlg's younger fans f the publication of this stallment  the Harry Potter  le As wh the three previous books Ms Rowlg has wrten an engagg  sty wh exquise characterization  no speakg-down to her juvenile  audience We get a me depth look at many of the Weasleys addg col   texture to this wonderful family Indeed we see addional sides to  several old fave ( not so fave) characters I will not clude  much  the way of details except to note that as Ms Rowlg warned this  book is considerably darker than the previous three Younger readers are  warned that they may not wish to use this book as their bedtime readg  However everyone should read   Not surprisgly  would be best to  read all the books  the series  der Me so than the previous ones  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot takes f granted the reader's knowledge of  what has occurred  the previous 3 years at Hogwarts Ps Thank you  Amazoncom f the paless  efficient method by which I received my  copy
I love this book J K Rowlg must have put so much wk to It's so addictgThat's what makes makes this book wonderful OverallThis book is THE BOMB
Harry Potter IV is the best book i have read this summer I have read all the other Harry Potter books  this one is my fave Not only is there a ltle b of romamce  jealousy there is also adventure!  The way  the characters  places are described you feel you are actually there  stg along wh Harry There is me danger  this book Harry must  face his fears  fd courage  himself  he wants to survive
Hmdoes  seem strange that a review f this book is already posted providg that the novel only came out a day ago on Saturday? Well considerg that the novel is an astoundg 700+ pages long (compared to  the 300+ of the previous novels)  is pretty strange I'm currently a  high school student studyg English f my summer school assignment   gaed a love f Harry Potter after readg the Scerer's Stone about a  year ago After beg slightly dissappoted wh book 2  3 (They  weren't que as good as book 1) I eagerly awaed book 4 hopg Rowlg  would come back wh some Hogwarts magic Happily I was not dissappoted  Harry Potter 4 is right up there  lerary qualy as book 1 The sty  this time is a lot me compellg  keeps the reader glued to the  pages just burng side f me Wh the addion of some br new  characters  some sty twists (which I'm not gonna say) this book is  truly one to read I started readg Saturday mng  just fished  Sunday night I can say that this book has one of the most credible  endgs also Wh the extra pages Rowlg has weaved a masterpiece of  fantasy fiction   any new reader of Harry Potter decides to read this  one first (Which is not that great of an idearead book 1 first!) they  will be overwhelmed by how good this is Believe the hype! Harry Potter is  not just a fad 's truly one of the greatest fantasy series wrten  Rowlg I believe can be compared to Jacques  the qualy of her  fantasy wld I cannot wa f Harry Potter 5
The fourth  latest  this magnicent series is every b as good as expected It troduces new terestg characters  amazg plots In addion to Harry's new trials wh Voldemt Rowlg once me pats a  picture of le  a wld of magic
This is the best one yet  Harry is growg  his view on the wld reflects this  Quiddch is great as always but this one is both darker  meatier  The kids discover the oppose sex  at least try toSce Harry is 14 stead of 11 his smart alec comments come me from  a posion of power  He is becomg one of the greatest boy characters  sce Huckleberry Fn  He is real he fights wh his friends he has  dreams of gruer  a great heartI laughed all through the book  but the funny parts felt me like comic relief than the central purpose  The endg is not as high  warm  fuzzy but me of a somber  preparg-f-the-stmMe great characters lots of loose ends   Dumblede is simply one of the greatest adults around  Dudley also gets  some payback f the years of tture towards Harry  This one is just  wonderful!
Still  keepg wh the tradion of the first three booksHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is fast paced rivettg However 's defely darker than the other three books The danger  the other books was me light-hearted whereas an nocent character dies  this book (as well as a lot of other deaths)  there is much me Dark Magic at play Rowlg seems to be stretchg thgs a b wh the troduction of new creatures such as Veela (which are not fully explaed) revealg that Hagrid is a half-Giant  the troduction of the Death Eaters as followers of Voldemt (Why didn't anyone call them Death Eaters  the previous three books?) The addion of Harry Potter to the Triwizard Tournament also seems a b fced although obviously necessary f the plot  Harry never seems to be as terested  perfmg the necessary tasks as he should be However there is some very terestg character development now that Harry Ron  Hermione are older  startg to notice their hmones which makes some of the chemistry  tension between the three of them me trigug As well Rowlgs contues to mata a good sense of hum regardg the misunderstgs between the wizard wld  the Muggle wld (Molly Weasley sends a letter to the Dursleys vg Harry to stay f the Quiddch Wld Cup  covers the envelope wh stamps not sure  she's got enough none of the wizards underst that 'buggg' means to secretly recd conversations) Overall an excellent must-read although possibly this book may not be as suable f younger readers as the other books were
Readg the longest Harry Potter book was like watchg a miseries on TV:  looked long  TV Guide but when the end came you wanted me I read all 700+ pages  less than 24 hours  my appete f the fth  book has only creased Voldemt is scarier Dumblede is wiser   Harry  the gang are growg up
Fave ( not so fave) characters return  we learn me of You Know Who's rise to power  This book is much darker than the previous three books  As Harry  his friends grow up they face the nmal dilemmas of  adolescence  the not so nmal hazards of beg wizards Because of the  darker aspects of the book I recommend parental guidance f the younger  HP fans  Neher I n my 12 year old have been able to put the book down  down sce we bought  It's as well wrten as the other four  a great  set up f Book 5  I can't wa till next summer to see what happens next
this one was the best yet!  I got  on Sat  have not put  down yet!  It is full of unexpected twists  turns
WOW! If you aren't already readg _The Goblet of Fire_ then please READ THIS! This book although a lengthy 734 pages is so excg well-wrten hilarious  even scary (at times) that I was que  impressed I had thought that this fourth book would be somewhat of a  let-down compared to the other three but I couldn't have been me WRONG!  I bought  at 11:00 am on Saturday  fished  at 12:25 pm on Sunday!  That's how rivetg this book is I won't give away imptant plot secrets  but I will say this: the endg was defely an unexpected twist Oh   another thg---someone a proment character  this book does die   the endyou have to read  to fd out who  is! That's all I'm sayg  ---PS Don't be timidated by the amount of pages! I'ts the content  that counts!
I held my breath when I started readg afraid (particularly considerg all the hype) that Rowlg would somehow stumble wh Goblet of Fire but  after fishg the book am pleased to rept that  my opion she has  surpassed her previous wk uppg the delights tensies   character development to a whole new level  This is the first book  the  series to make me cry  There are some terric twists at the end--don't  let anyone spoil them f you  I feel I certaly got me than my money's  wth  look fward eagerly to the next
This book is really really really really really really really really really really really GOOD!  I got this book the day  was published  didn't put  down until I fished  If you ask me this  book should get about 300 stars I recommend this book to everyone! I  especially like the character &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody If you're lookg  f some good summer readg read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire!
How can anyone actually like this book  I am ashamed to say that I have actually read   i hated   It makes no sense  rawlgs is strag f somethg that Harry can do  his fourth year  i shudder to  thk what the fth book will be like
I have never read any thg as non-muggle as Harry Potter the Goblet of Fire! I hurried to the ste early the mng of July8th  bought   I haven't put  down sce Rowlg has really outdone herself  this novel wh thrillg twist  turns  the plot yet you still have the same good old characters from the books befe I am eagerly awag books 5 6  7!
J K Rowlg has created another wonderful book  her Harry Potter series wh Goblet of Fire  As Harry  friends have matured so have the plot les  the tension  suspense underlyg them  I'm not sure how  the latest book will play wh young children but as an adult admirer of  Harry I could not put  down  As his 4th year at Hogwarts begs Harry  is confrontg me danger from whout  changes from wh  But Ms  Rowlg never descends to tiresome teenage angst as Harry  friends  face danger  their own changg attudes towards one another  And the  laugh out loud moments appear often to break the creasg  tensionPeople wonder why Harry Potter has become the phenomenom  is  The most basic reason  the one most often overlooked is that J K  Rowlg is a fabulous wrer!
I liked this book better than the other 3 HP books because of the Triwizard tournament I liked that is was dangerous  unexpected thgs happened
I have read Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  am readg  aga  Many people might need too  Don't get me wrong this was an excellent book but considerg that I read   2 days  was a tad confusg  This 734 page 37 chaptered book volves much action  a lot of scares  Even though younger people will be readg this considerg the content   is most likely good f children ages 10  up
The new Harry Potter book was excellent  People who have notread the other Harry Potter books would still underst what wasgog on  the sty because  was all explaed  I liked how there was lots of risg action befe the climax happen  This Harry Potter book was longer then the others but i believe   was shter  text you would miss out on a lot of action  I liked how they still went the Hogwarts  still had all of there classes  none of the characters were left out!
This book was great!  I could not put  down  The first 6  7 pages aren't that great but after that well  I loved   In this book Harry sees the ghosts of his mom  his dad  all the ghosts of Voldemts many victims  This book was a ltle long but wonderful  I give this  book 6 stars!
I've read the Harry Potter series from the begng  ade  And that defately extends to Book 4 It is a wonderful captivatg sty filled wh even greater doses of the usual mystery  triuge! The plot  thickens quickly f Harry  his friends but let me warn you this one  is SCARY! Harry is growg up  many of the rums about this book prove  true--the sty le gets darker by the chapter But don't let that   the whoppg 734 pages scare you off--this is a truly magnicent tale   I already can't wa until the next stallment hs the sts!
In the Goblet of Fire Harry returns to Hogwarts f his fourth year  is one of the four contestants chosen to compete  the competion between the other two magic schools  Durg the last of the three challenges  Harry is transpted to a face to face competion wh the dark Ld who  discards his feeble fm  takes on a new  strong body  At the  conclusion of his fal task Harry fds himself  mtal combat wh he  who shall not be named  a battle of the ws Despe the length this  volume pulls together the events of the previous books  sets the stage  of the battle ragg between the fces of good  evil
I just fished this book   was really neat It was also really long I liked the fact that they had somethg dferent f a change the Triwizard Tournament I liked  because  had a lot of action

OK I'm fally over my I'm-too-old-to-be-readg-this-Harry-Potter-book problem  After I read the first chapter to the ltle girl I babysat I was hooked  I had to run out right away  get the whole set which I  read  about 2 days  I simply couldn't wa too read what would happen  next  When fally the 4th book was due to come out I was so exced!  I  got my copy  I just kept readg until  was fished  Not too give  away  secrets  anythg but this book lives up to all the hype   hoopla surroundg s release  It is an excg fastpaced action  packed can't-put--down-until-your-done book  I loved   I hope  that JK Rowlg will contue her wonderful wk wh the harry Potter  series I alreadt can't wa f the 5th!
Harry's newest adventure is full of mystery  excement a ltle long but the sty couldn't be told  a shter way  I fnished  5 hours  after I bought   I could just not put  down!  Despe 's length   is an excellent book
It is official    wh the release of the fourth of seven books that make up this mystyg Epic JK Rowlg has established herself as arguably the most spectacular creative wrer wkg today  F the  fourth time Rowlg has composed a plot of such impermeable solidy that  one cannot help but to become spellbound wh awe at her unquestionable  lerary genius  In this novel Harry Potter shows defe signs of  acquirg much mental physical  magical matury  Along wh help  from his good friends Ron Weasley  Hermione Granger Harry learns  valuable lessons pertag to stealg golden eggs from deadly  Hn-tailed dragons battlg evil wizards who want to kill him  yes  Harry even begs to notice what was once to him an elusive species of  magical animal: Girls! And matury is what Harry desperately needs f  his antipode of power--the all-evil Ld Voldemt--fds a way to come  back to power  But not only has You-Know-Who found a way to atta rebirth  through a re of hrible wickedness He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has too  found a way to overcome his one weakness    no longer does the Power of  Love which Harry's mother bestowed upon her son wh her fatal sacrice  protect Harry from Voldemt  Therefe Voldemt is back  he is even  me hrible than he has ever been  Hold on to your broomsticks Potter  fans!  F this is the pivotal Potter book that will leave readers stg  on the edge of their Firebolts desperately awag the next Hogwarts  school year  which the protects of what is Good hope to une so to  thwart Voldemt  his Death Eaters' potential reign of destruction
I have been wag f this book f a year   was defely wth the wa  All the fave people were back  some addional new ones  I  especially liked the addion of Ron's older brothersI didn't like   as well as the other books though It isn't que as funny as the  previous ones It is a ltle darker than the previous books  has a  ltle me &quotlanguage&quot which might stop parents of small children  from readg  to themAlthough the book is about 700 pages I was  glad It gave me me to read  me details to enjoyCan't wa  until the next one comes out!
This book was the best out of all four!  I got  the day  came out  I haven't put  down sce(Lerally)  The book is about the Tri-Wizard Tournament at school  Only children above 17 are allowed to  enter  The tournament goes on between 3 wizardg schools Hogwarts  Durmstrang  Buexbatons  One champion from each school will be chosen  out of the Goblet of Fire which judges which of the entries are most wthy  to participate f their school  Somehow Harry's name has been put    he has been chosen!  He now must compete  3 dangerous tasks  Harry  wks through out most of the school year preparg f these tasks  The  book remas excg throughout  I would advise anyone who liked the  other three books to buy this as soon as possible to read you'll love   as much as you loved the others!
This book certaly changes the way I look at Harry Potter  Not only because of the hmone stuff  the crushes but because of that this book is so  a dferent pot of view  Everythg is so loosely put but is is a great book  The plot really is  this book like JK Rowlg says  The Triwizard Tournament is very signicant because Quiddich matches are  cancled because of   Now that's a maj change  And the people from  other schools also have a very signicant effect on the people at  Hogwarts The end of the book is not remotely frighteng but very good  I won't give the endg away f you but lets just say that this book  really leaves you hangg  Not that much but the way she puts  is like  somethg hrible is happeng  you won't know what  is until a year  later Harry defetly gets smarter  this book  You can tell  Also one  of the thgs that gets me confused is who everyone likes  the end of the  book except someone  It's very confusg Now the person that dies I'm  not tellg you but I personally don't care about who  was at all  I  mean that person barely is an imptant character f heaven's sake!  It's  kda sad but I'll get over   5 seconds There are a LOT of  revelations  this book  It may not surprise you but  is a revelation  Also one about Fudge's err TRUE character But overall this is a good  book I would say my second fave overall  The prisoner of Azkaban was  better  But I do recommend  very much This year's defense agast the  dark arts teacher is so- distant  yet plays a VERY imptant role  the  end so watch out!
Just fished readg The fourth novel  was by far the best  my opion constantly answerg questions from previous novels as well as constantly creatg even me questions f her future wks to unravelJust Buy It!
As many reviews have mentioned already the fourth Harry Potter book is darker than Rowlg's previous books The fact that makes these dark parts of the book ( cludg very a vivid description of Voldemt  still  have flashbacks!) is Ms Rowlgs extradary talent of takg you INTO  the book makg your imagation soar as though every wd is actually said   everythg is happeng right then  there You fd yourself  laughg wh the characters  cryg at their misftunes ( especially  Harry's) I'm sure JKR was tryg to be realistic showg children that  there is a dark side to everythg but took  a ltle far f a  children's book There is a pot  the book where Voldemt ttures a  wizard by lettg him lay on the ground wh no py while his blood is  leavg him through a chopped off body part Beg older I could tell  myself  is only a book  but could children of a younger age? I would  defely consider this befe buyg this book to a child
This is the best book  the entire series! Don't let the size get you down once you get to  you can't put  down!
All Harry lovers please don't kill me In fact I'm a fanatic myself It's just that  seems like 's not a children's book anyme I was  expectg somethg me like the first 3 books You now HAPPY! JK  Rowlg is still an amazg wrer but book 4 is a transional novel  It's open ended (I hate those) but still I'm wag f the 5th one  When is is comg out? :)
Although the length of the book is a b dauntg 's a fast  fun read  I enjoyed readg  very much-- fact I read  nonstop  one day There were some terestg twists  the sty  Rowlg seemed to be layg the groundwk f the rest of the series wh this tle  While  this book is slightly darker  tone that the others (Yes the rums are  true  There is a death)there is still plenty of hum between Fred   Gege's tricks  Harry  Ron's discovery of girls  I buy very few  books f myself but this was a must-have  I'm very glad I've got 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was my fave Harry Potter book  It was well wrten  I could not put  down  I liked how you never knew who the bad guy was  I even felt nervous when Harry was  trouble- I  was scared f him  I felt that J K  Rowlg had the book planned out  she did not just thk of the sty as she went along  she knew what she  was gog to wre  even gave hts to what was gog to happen  She  kept on talkg about what had happened  previous Harry Potter books so  I recommmend skimmg through the other books so you will underst  Harry Potter is able to go to the Quiddch Cup wh Hermione  Ron!  He  even gets to see Krim the seeker f the Bulgarian team!  Harry is  his  fourth year at Hogwarts  beg his usual self gets  trouble  He  makes friends wh the new Dark Arts teacher who used to be an Aur  a  dark wiozard catcher!  In this book Harry makes new friends   unftunately almost loses some  Malfoy is as bad as always  is makg  this year hard In this book Harry faces new  exictg chalenges  I  really enjoyed this book  recommend  to everyone
Wh &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot out f only two days at least one rather Squibbish review has emerged callg this fourth stallment `dark  drawn-out'  This is nothg sht of wildly  accurate  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is deed over seven hundred pages  long but  never drags  loses eher s tensy  sense of fun  I  f one had fished  wh twenty-four hours havg purchased    the only slow moments I experienced were when I was fcibly kept away from  readg   Rums of both romance  death were way overblown  no  ne-year-old boy need wry that Harry is gog to be tatg himself  wh a girlfriend any time soon :-) The focus remas exactly where   should on the buildg  mystery  suspense raised at the begng of  the book wh plenty of fays to the Hogwarts experience f laughs  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is deed somewhat darker than any of the  previous three but 's nothg that a ten-year-old won't be able to  hle  I found  delightfully creepy  even the most dire scenes at  the climax of the book still remaed me fun albe  a creepy st of  way than frighteng  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is  a me-than-wthy success to the first three  the series easily as  funny smart  excg as s predecesss
This is  my opion the best Harry Potter Book JK Rowlg has wrten so far It was well wth the wa I don't give away the endg of the book but the endg is very scary   is st of a clfhanger endg You  will also meet alot of new charecters  this book  students from  dferant wizardg schools It was so good  only took two days to  fish You will not be disapoted wh this book
Fally Harry Potter has returned! This book is so totally awesome All the hub bub about this book is nothg compared to the real 734 pages  actually was I mean there were such surprises  happy moments Oh there were sad pots too:) READ THIS BOOK! IT WILL KEEP  YOU OCCUPIED FOR A LOOOOONNNNGGG TIME!
I read Goblet of Fire  about 9 hours  I wouldn't recommend readg the book that quickly  There is just too much fmation to absb  such a detailed book It was good though I wish I had taken my time  carefully  read   It is obvious that Ms Rowlg has darkened the books extremely  I wouldn't recommend this book f a child of ten  under as  has me  mature subject matter than previous books  F anyone eleven  older  this is a good book to read  I recommend  highly as  is possibly the  best book  the series
This book had the most dramatic buildup  astonishg climax of the Harry Potter series that have been published to date  though I missed the excement of the Quiddch matches the Triwizard Tournament me than made up f   The plot was excellent  kept me guessg  I thought  that  was Ludo Bagman who had entered Harry's name  the Goblet of Fire   that &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody ( at least Barty Crouch transfmed  to Moody)was like another Lup: someone entirely on Harry's side  But  the excg climax revealed the real &quotbad guy&quot to me  I  found that my guesses were completely off track  This book is defately  gog to keep you readg once you open the cover
The fourth book Goblet of Fire although over 700 pages reads easily  keeps the Harry Potter series alive  The begng of the book is a b slow but as wh the others you don't want the sty to end!  Harry  Ron Hermonione are older  are now teens  They are like family after  readg books I II  III  These are characters you care about  want  to know me about  I can't wa f Book V!  Wre fast Ms Rowlg
This is by far the best book  the Harry Potter series What a ride! I was on the edge of my seat f hours as I watched Harry go through the most dangerours series of trials he has ever encountered As usual the plot was  credibly tight -- I looked f the clues I found the clues  yet I  couldn't figure out what was gog to happen next Nothg is predictable   this book As soon as I read the chapter on the goblet of fire (chapter  16) I new I wasn't gog to be able to set  down (I fally fished   at 2:30 am) I was glad to see that some of Voldemt's suppters were  brought out to the open  &quotunmasked&quot At least we know that  there is a group that is still loyal to the Dark Ld  that some of  them are  pretty fluential posions Now maybe there will be a ltle  less pretense  polics  a ltle me action  the Mistry We  will all just have to wa  see how Harry  Dumblede tackle the evil  that has been released There is so much me to this sty that was to  be told Thank you J K f the best one yet!
At 734 pages this book has a satisfyg heft which will please all Potter fans who raced through the three earlier ( shter) books  In  this fourth stallment Harry Potter once aga begs a new school year   fds himself quickly immersed  unexpected challenges dangers   puzzles The fascatg cast of characters exps as me of Henry's back  sty emerges  he learns me of  the dark events of the past that are  shapg his le today  The drama of the three tasks he faces   competion is somewhat fced but the deeper struggle agast Ld  Voldemt is compellg readg
If you like the Harry Potter Series then you'll love the fourth stallment of this wonderful series  You won't be able to image all of  the trials  tribulations of Harry Potter  his friends as they attend  their fourth year at the Wizardg School &quotHogwarts&quot  This book  is JKR at her best  Order now  read the whole book  one night like  I did  I can't wa till the fth one comes out!
Just fish readg 734 pages last night whout sleepg  couldn't believe Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire turns out to be the best of all Harry Potter series It's about  the begng that Wmtail  Muggle  who plans revenge f killg Harry But they couldn't kill him Harry   all his friends arrives to the International Quiddch Cup to fd out the  mysterious taken place  Hogwarts of two school magic My fave part   this book is when Harry couldn't be nmal  some section that makes me  laughI strongly urged you to read this book It's fill wh magical that I  have never read  my le befeI have also heard that about 15 million  copies have sold  midnight I hope JK Rowlg will wre year 5 soon   will fish fastly Believe   not maybe I should be  the guness  wld of recds f the first person who fish the novel out of 15  million people
Couldn't put  down cold barely turn the pages fast enough  Great sty but a b dark  I don't want to give any plot pots away but all  all 's fantasmagical!Harry Potter was a great sty to beg  wh but now that we 've gotten to the turng pot of the book series I  can't beg to say how much me  depth 's become!To name a few  great thgs about this book would be really hard because 's wonderful!  Anyway  details Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogwart's Acadamy a magical  shool f all the future warlocks  wches of Engl  In  you get to  see how Harry hles the pressures of school  adolescence!That's  about enough of that!  READ IT!  You won't be disappoted!
I got my copy Saturday eveng  fished  Sunday mng I can't describe the emotional roller coaster I've been on followg Harry's adventures I was thrilled wh him he watched the Quiddch Wld Cup I  was tense when he was fdg the nerve to ask a girl to the ball I was  draed after an encounter wh You-Know-Who It's a really gted auth  who can create this kd of universeWh sequels I always wry that  the plot will eventually weaken  get old There seems to be no danger of  that  this series There are always lots of new thgs to discover   viss from old friends (we get que a few  this book -- remember  Dobby?) Rowlg has given us closure while still leavg a lot unresolved  f us to look fward to  No 5I regret readg this so quickly  only because I now have that much longer to wa f the next one!
This sty is the best book I've ever read  my le This book can be enjoyed by people of all ages It is a perfect addion to the previous 3 Harry Potter books I recommend everyone to read this book that love  thrillg terestg  excg fantasy sties
Among the twistg plot JK Rowlg has yet aga contued the sty of Harry Potter  his unbelievable  humous friends  Harry has returned as strong  as magical as ever  has repeated the spell as strong at   was the first time the one that kept me up all night readg  left me  tired but happy come mng  Fun  allurg The Golbet of Fire has  defely found a home on my bookshelf
Wh each book Rowlg blows the last out of the water Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is no exceptionThe sty picks up the tale of our hero (not tail that would have been a Dudley sty *grs*) now fourteen   eagerly awag to leave the dreaded Dursley's behd f a Wld Cup  Quiddch match tournment  two weeks wh his best friend Ron's family  the Weasley's Bothered by disturbg dreams of You-Know-Who Harry is  none-the-less determed to have a good time But of course beg Harry  Potter trouble seems to follow him like a magnent  befe you can say  Avara Kadavera ( please don't) Harry is up to his specs  danger  excement  at last romance Hogwart's is competg agast two other  schools  the Triwizard contest igally banned f leadg to too many  student deaths And some is very eager to see Harry take partThere are  parts  this book to make your roar  laughter (The Weasley's arrival at  the Drusley Household)  some that make you weep Yes the rum's you  have heard are true  Harry must face what ultimately we all do the  death of a friend He will also learn however that love is the most  powerful magic of all
Harry Potter is  his 4th year at Hogwarts a school f wches  wizards However he is called to be  a &quotTriwizard&quot tournament when contestents are supposed to be  their 6th  7th year That is only  one of the mysterious thgs that happens to Harry This volume compared to  the previous 3 volumes is longer  me terestg as Harry grows older
I don't know how Rowlg is gog to top this pivotal sty  It is defatly the best  the darkest out of the four  I won't give you any details because  will spoil  JUST GET IT AND READ IT If you don't  you won't know what your miss'!
It was as good as I expected It only took me a day to fish The endg was dark but  was wth 
Although the book's length makes  slow-movg at times J K Rowlg was right  sayg this is the pivot of the Harry Potter series The mood is defely darker than the previous stallments of the series but like  all the others 'll make you both laugh cry  scare you at various  pots of the sty My only advice is to try to read  slowly - there's a  year to wa till the next one   defely leaves you desperate f  me!
This has got to be the BEST Harry Potter book yet!  Although  is about twice as long as the previous stallments I believe the length is completely necessary due to the complex  rivetg plot  It took me only  a day to fish the book because  was so absbg  once  was  fished  was like a cold splash of water to the face sayg &quotCOME  BACK TO REALITY!&quot A lot of the characters  earlier books are back  not to mention a few new faces (like Ron's hyper owl Pigwidgeon--better  known simply as &quotPig&quot)  And of course the Dursleys  Draco  Malfoy are as hateful as ever  Rowlg enhances the wld she has created  wh me wty characters  ideas  I only wish she didn't leave such  dreadful loose ends to tie  wh the next book because I'm still  clamg f me me MORE!  The awful thg about this series is  that  will not go on fever!  This is a must read f all ages even  somebody who thks they're too old f such sties
I was anxiously awag the release of the 4th Harry Pottersty  When  arrived i soon found out  was wth the wa  Icouldn't stop readg   Once aga JK Rowlg provides an amusg plotle wh many unexpected twists  turns  Harry Ron  Hermione go through many challenges  tests of their friendship durg their fourth year at Hogwarts  The school is abuzz wh the comg of the Triwizard tournament which features 2 other schools of magic as guests at Hogwarts  Harry mysteriously becomes volved  the tournament  His adventures take him to many dangerous places such as a fight wh a dragon  a reaquatance  duel wh the most feared dark wizard of al time Ld Voldemt  To fd out the rest you have to read the book  I thk  is the best so far  will be anxiously wag another year befe I can read me about Harry  his adventures
It looks like JK Rowlg knows what she's dog Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a whoppg 734 pages long! While other series of books may have repetetion  the seemgly same plot The Goblet of Fire has s  own twist while stickg wh that amazg Harry Potter theme I must say  however that this book is defetley darker than the others wh times  becomg creasgly evil F this reason  the fact that the language  is slightly stronger younger children may fd  timidatg  All   all this a wonderfully wrten book that leads to a much MUCH darker  time
This Beg the longest book  the series Has even me plot twists  surprises than the first three booksI won't give anythg away but the last couple of chapters are the most surprisg of all I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes Harry PotterI cant wa until next year when  book 5 comes out
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is simply brilliant  I had trouble puttg the book down  Like you would care!  I found the book to be dferent  many ways  First of all there was no excg feelg about Hogwarts  has changed!  Maybe  was the fact that Harry was havg a  dficult time wh beg a champion!  That's me than I should have told  you  It's also dferent  the plot  There's no murderer loose no one  is turg people to stone  There's just some suspicious characters  Somehow I didn't feel that there was a big threat  the book (however  there was a lastg one from the first chapter readers should know what I  mean)  Don't read this book  you haven't read any of the others  In  fact read all of the other Harry Potter books befe readg the Goblet of  Fire  It's certaly the most twisted  unpredictable as well That's me fmation that anyone  who hasn't read  should know!  Anyway the Goblet of Fire is truly  magnicent  is like no other Harry Potter book  even any other book  that I've read!
This book was really good!  I got  at midnight on Friday  was done by midnight on Saturday! In &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot Harry Ron  Hermione go to the Wld Cup  see the triwizard  tournament This book is my fave  now the four Harry Potter books! If  you haven't read the others read them  this one too!
JK Rowlg has h the mark aga wh her latest book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  It has all of the twists  turns of all of the previous 3 stallments of the the Harry Potter saga  then some  The  book is que long but full of detail  Readers will enjoy the kd of  conflict  resolution ( maybe contued conflict) that everyone  experiences wh their relationships  friendships  We once aga learn  some facatg tidbs about Harry  his friends  are left wh some  tantalizg clues about the direction of the next book  the series This  book is much me emotional  character Harry has a crush on a girl at  school  one of his friends dies (no you won't fd out which one from  me)  The les between good  bad are also slowly becomg me clear  which will lead to a pivol confrontation  a future stallment  I  like this well wrten series as  is a great 'read'  I read professional  manuals on a daily basis  want an excg well wrten sty f my  'time off'  My 13 year-old daughter troduced me to the books  I thk  that  is great that we have somethg that we can share  (She does  however thk that I'm nuts when I read the 734 pages at one stg   took me most of 10 hours)  The one drawback is that now we will have to  wa f the next book
I looked fward as much as anyone else  the wld (approx 15 million people) to the latest stallment  Harry Potter's adventures--prepared as an adult  a connoiseur of children's books to fd that the 4th book  wouldn't be as excg  breath-takg as the first three  especially  the 3rd  Was I wrong!  From the first chapter of Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire JK Rowlg proves  that she is nothg sht of excellent  The book is full of great hum the complexies of friendship amazg  magic  keep-you-up-at-night action  suspense The Quiddch Wld  Cup is only the begng  Who could have thought that anythg could be  me excg than Quiddch?  But there is-- the goblet of fire is just  the startg pot  JK Rowlg also pulls no punches  She has previously  said that she wanted to prove once  f all the evil that Voldemt is  wh this book  she does so wh events so hric that parents of  younger fans may need to guide their kids through the book  But I am  grateful that she doesn't pull punches Details  events from the first  three books are woven brilliantly together  Harry's wld defely  became even me real  he Ron Hermione Dumblede  other  characters we've come to love do as well  readers will be drawn wh  their full empathy to wizard le  The mania surroundg Harry Potter  isn't simple marketg hype--'s the genue enthusiasm of readers who  have fallen  love wh a very believable wld  wh very believable  people  Now I just don't know how long I can wa f book 5the Goblet  of Fire left me anxious thrilled but 100% satisfied
this book is very excictg  scary  i would not recameme this to anyone under 7 this is some of miss rowlg best wk
This book was great!  It is a very long book but  is excg the whole way through  I've only had  36 hours  I fished  -  I'm only eleven  The plot grabs you right away  keeps you  the book  Whenever  you need to get up  stop readg you feel the need to compla because  &quotI'm  a very imptant part!&quot  Great book f all ages  It's  very excg  The best Harry Potter book so far  J K Rowlg comes up  wh the most terestg creatures that no one has even dreamed of And  some of her spells are much dferent than what you would expect  Harry  along wh his friends Ron  Hermione go through really dangerous   breathtakg adventures  I recommend this book to anyone that likes  adventure books  mysterious magical thgs
While I may not f the demographics f lovers of Harry Potter  his friends I have deed read all four books  the series as well as sendg copies to my grsons  From page one of The Goblet of Fire to page 734  this is a wner  The sty begs wh excg events which tell us that  Harry is deed gog to meet new challenges which will require both  personal courage  the suppt of his school friends  the adult  wizards from Hogwarts Activies which any school may clude (such as the  Yule Ball) let us see that even though the students may be learng much  about wizardry they still have the same uncertaies as Muggle boys   girls  The three tasks are real page turners  the reader is never sure  how each will be concluded  The fal chapter &quotThe Begng&quot  gives us a glimpse of the personal growth that Harry  his friends have  made over the year Loyalty fair play learng to accept others f what  they are rather than their appearance  achievements are  thgs we all  need to act upon No matter our age we can learn somethg from Harry  Potter
The latest Harry Potter tale is just as compellg  imagative as the ones that preceded  full of creative twists  turns  But like the others  the series &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is not primarily a  book about wchcraft except f s delightfully peculiar settg It is  a book about le  how  can be at turns both exhileratg  satisfyg terryg confusg  sad It is also a book about choices  friendship loyalty  great personal courage The populary of this  series is testimony to the great longg of today's children to make sense  of the thgs that happen to them  le JK Rowlg jos the ranks of  CS Lewis JRR Tolkien  Susan Cooper  rewkg the deep myths of  tradional folkle to meet this search f meang  to help readers  st out the crical issues of good  evil that confront them at every  age of le
If you've know Harry Potter already you don't need me to tell you what to read  You're readg this review to hear a friendly voice say &quotYou aren't alone!  Harry Potter is fun  's okay to adm !&quot  I  wre to you ( also to the uniated pale your le has been until  now) -- Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire does not disappot  Rowlg's  vibrant imagation conjures up me creatures me schemes  surprises   also me evil to tempt us to dream once aga that we had me  magic  our lives
I thought this book was surprisgly good It was imagive  suspensive but never limed But i thought  was a ltle long though i like long books
Harry was awesome at age eleven  he will contue to be awesome through-out his lovely well wrten ficticious le  I wouldn't md beg a wizard/wch  Out of all of the 4 books JK Rowlg has wrten so far none of them can you consider as your fave  They all capture  your heart wh the first 3 pages at the most  However I can adm that  even though I have no fave (sce all are so amazg! )  I KNOW that  the 4th one IS THE BEST!  The plot  all of Harry's adventures  certaly blow away your md  I would consider JK Rowlg's Harry  Potter books the 8th Wld Wonder!  I have not read any decently long book  (752 pg f #4) by any auth (wh the exception of Ms Rowlg) that was  remotely terestg  However Harry Potter #4 is not remotely  terestg  It is so extradary I cannot express my enjoyment of the  book wh wds  But  you want to read somethg where somebody can  &quotconjure&quot wds that flow gracefully on the pages READ HARRY  POTTER!  The characters are so real  fact the whole book seems so  real you feel as  you have just fished readg a non-fiction  assignment f histy  Now histy is your fave subject  school  The only bad thg about Harry Potter is that this amazg book series  unftunately ends at book seven  I thk that now is the time I should  end this describg of the AWESOME 4th book  I fear I may blow your md  by me descriptions f the cause of 's awesomeness  So READ  &quotHARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE! &quot  discover secrets so  juicy so sweet so surprisg you'll want gobble   a second  ask  f  &quot1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ths&quot
I got this book the day  came out  had  fished that night!  I couldn't put  down  There is a new surprise around every cner  sometimes two  I recommend this book to book fans everywhere especially  ones who already love Harry Potter
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  The Harry Potter series just keeps gettg better  better  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is no exception  The plot is thoughly excg  suspenseful--a real page-turner  this!-- what fun to meet aga the characters from the previous books  who by now are like old friends  Don't be timidated by the sheer size of  this volume--there's just me Harry Potter to love!  This adult reader  highly recommends &quotGoblet of Fire&quot!  Enjoy!
While JK Rowlg wrote the first three books  this series very well the latest stallment will likely disappot all but the die-hard fans  The book is imagative but  aims at a much lower audience than befe   the wrg style is clearly flawed as Rowlg probably rushed  to  meet a deadle  You should probably reserve the book at a library befe  wastg your money on 
I adm I was a b wried Wh all the buildup  hype  so fth f the release of the 4th stallment  the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up that all the excement would be f  nothg But the brilliant JK Rowlg has done  aga- wh a book  that  my opion is the best  the series so far In this book Harry  sees the Quiddch Wld Cup discovers girls is entered  a st of  spell duel meets some new friends  foes becomes farther  then  closer to his friend Ron  once aga has a brush wh well  You-Know-Who but I won't give  all away After hungrily devourg  over 700 pages of glious fiction  about 4 hours I was left wh a gr  on my face a feelg of triumph f Harry  a pang that told me the  book was over  that alas I would have to wa a while f the  sequel Thank you JK Rowlg! What a wonderful magical phenomenon you  have created
The fourth book of the series is fantastic! JK Rowlg has done  aga!  In this fourth book Voldemt (oh no! I said the name!) may have a once  a letime chance of comg back to power! Meanwhile Harry  Potter is entered agast his  Dumblede's will to a contest   which he battles agast three other wizards/wches f his le! And  befe all this even happens Harry gerts top box tickets to the Quiddch  Wld Cup! (Along wh Weasleys  Hermione of course!) Also 's the  longest book of the series 734 pages! (How long will the Fth book  be1000 pages) This is book everyone from 1 to 101 should read!  Congradulations JK Rowlg on your fourth excellent book!All you Harry  Potter fans out there get the book now! And watch out f the dark  mark!BEWARE! All Muggles who do not believe  Harry Potter STUPIFY!
the me books Rowlg wres the better they seem to get Once I started this book I just couldn't put  down F one thg the quiddich games are much betterI didn't thk harry was gog to make the quiddch team but I'm glad he didThis way he was able to show off his talent not only   front of Hogwarts school but  front of the beauxbatons  Durmstrang  schools alsoThe new characters are also as igal as Rowlgs first ones  I liked Ra Skeeter  ALast Moody almost as much as one of my all time  faves Proffes Lup! I don't want to give away to much  of the plot f those who haven't read  yet but this is a must read as  apparently most people already know {Bestsellg book this year!}If you  don't own this book I suggest you buy  on Amazoncom immediately
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the longest stallment of the Harry Potter series is well wth the wa  Fans will love how the sty begs wh a scary revelation  immediately bewches the reader  Heart  beatg suspense turns the pages as you learn me of the wizardg wld   a magical tournament that endangers Harry's le  The Goblet of Fire  is a must read f any Potter fan  could captivate any reader to hours  of fun
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  my opion the best Harry Potter book JK Rowlg has done a marvellous jod creatg the one charecter that has found a home  most people's heart A lot of people are wag to  sk their teeth to this book  And  your wag f  to h the  shelves  will be wth the wa Harry has two week till school starts   he is countg down He is extremely exced Livg wh the Dursleys  is a drag f Harry But thgs liven up when Harry get a peculcir  ventation from Ron Uncle vernon relucatnly agrees to this Sunday comes   the Wealeys arrive (In a very strange way!) When they reach home They  got to the Quiddh Wld cup And they have a ball Thgs go by  He  sets of to Hogwarts then somethg begs to happen They have somethg  called the Triwizard competion where Harry woul like to eneter but is  unfnutely to young He had to be seventeen to enter that contest But  somethg strange happenes  Harry's name is picked  then the trouble  starts Harry is netered  the contest which is riskg his like  the  problem is he didn't enter Somethg fish has been gog on  harry has  to tell his god Father  befe Voldemet (Pardon the wd) returns to  full powerA terric sty very touchcg All harry fans have to read     you haven't give  a try You won't regret !
This fourth book  the Harry Potter series of seven is billed as &quotpivotal&quot by the cover  is certaly delivers on that promise  It is Rowlg's longest wk yet but the plot stays strong f  all 735 pages  I especially enjoyed that she broke away from the stard  practice of reexplag the characters locations  plot pots from  previous novels at the very begng of the book  Instead she has them  unfold over the course of the novel which recaptures that sense of  discovery that readers will recall from the first few books  Rowlg  wres the sty  such a way that those who have not read the first three  books will be able to follow the plot yet HP veterans will not be bed by  a &quotrecap&quot chapter  The length of the novel dems new  characters be added but is also allows the development of some of the me  m character from previous books such as Arthur Weasley  the  teachg staff to take on a me proment role  The book provides a  deeper glimpse to the power structure of the Wizardg wld  Rowlg  focuses on the trails of beg an adolescent tryg to deal wh  friendship jealousy  adult expectations  Another benef of the  longer book is that the subplots of this book are me thoughly  developed  Hermione Ron  Neville are expled at greater length   the students' are faced wh some challenges to their preconceived notions  of what makes a le valuable  There is a lot gog on  the book:  new locations  names fascatg spells  charms  unexpected plot  developments  The bottom le is that HP fans will be delighted wh the  developments shocked by the revelations  trigued to read what  happens as he enters his fth year  Let's hope Rowlg doesn't make us  wa too long
Who dies  who lives Does  fact a fave character die at the end of the book? You will hate me  I answered that question - though not as much as Ms Rowlgs All I can say is - there are three me books comg  down the pipele So be prepared to wa like me till midnight at your  fave bookste In the meantime  you want your children to graduate  to &quotchapter books&quot (as my kids say)stead of beg stuck wh  &quotpicture books&quot buy this book There is still enough time left   summer to read them ( make them read to you)the complete book The hype  certaly exceeds the qualy (Show Woman Rowlgs)  my personal  preference remas Enid Blyton (because I don't exactly go f hocus  pocus) But the kids are really hepped up  that is good - the book  teaches good grammar improves vocabulary  sets your imagation to  fire
This book is the utter most famous book of the year probably I absolutely loved   The suspense was killg  the sty was awe spirg At then end i was teary eyed This book will make a drastic change  the  sequels about what will happen  the comg years f harry This book  shows that the magic comes from wh us even  you are a wizard
Pre-derg this book was the greatest idea I've had Fishg the 734 page book  less than six hours should show exatly how great this book is f a Potter-lovg Muggle As wh her pri books Rowlg engrosses the  reader the l of wizardry  magic Like Prisoner of Azkaban Rowlg  brgs characters from past books to a whole new light A great read f  Muggles of all ages
When the Triwizard Competion comes  all wizards  wches ageseventeen older can put their name  the Goblet of Fire to enter thecontest Harry thks he will just get to st on the sideles  watch the contest But somehow his name is picked How did his name get ?I thk the book was great It has s really funny parts too  I thk this book is the best so far
This new &quotHarry Potter&quot book I believe tops the rest of the series so far It is SO good you won't be able to put  down! I thought the plots were fantastic JK Rowlg really is a great wrer I look  fward to readg the next &quotHarry Potter&quot book!
After readg the first book  this series  October 1998 I have been obsessed wh Rowlg's accounts of Harry Potter  his experiences at Hogwarts a school f wizards  wches Each book  the series  develops the characters me fully  the plots crease  complexy  The fourth book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire achieves me complex  characterizations of Harry Ron Hermione Hagrid Dumblede Draco  Malfoy  of course He Who Must Not Be Named  The tone darkens  somewhat  the evil ones beg to threaten me fcefully  As did  Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban this novel contas several  sister adults  These evil ones contue to present Harry wh  creasgly complicated tasks  challenges  A sense of mystery pervades  the book Can Harry contue to prevail over Voldemt?  Why does he have  to spend every summer wh the Dursleys?  What does Dumblede see as good   Snape  Hagrid?  Will Harry develop romantic terests  young  wches at Hogwarts?  Just as Rowlg had promised  these issues are  addressed  this book  many imptant questions are answered  This  terric auth  sps this fourth tale skillfully cludg the  delightful details that are characteristic of her wonderful style  the  first three novels  Whout a doubt this book will please readers of  all ages  The elements of a fantastic tale reside wh the 734 pages of  this novel  no reader will be disappoted  what Rowlg  has crafted   this book  Now how long must we wa f Harry Potter V?
The hefty  long book Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire at first seemed that  would just be another long  bg book  However at the moment when I started to read  I thought Hey this isn't so bad!  I  spent the whole day readg (up until about 11:45 at which I fished (on  the 8th))  I'm not gog to spoil the sty f everyone but I really  liked Harry Potter's 4th year at Hogwarts  I thk that while this book  is rather long everyone should read 
Well 's fally here After gettg the book at midnight last night I read through  fished  at about 6:00 this eveng The fourth book is a good deal longer than the other three wh a total of 752 pages The book is also me serious  dangerous than the other three Harry is  growg up  his challenges  dangers are growg as well Me of the  actual Voldemt  this book so 's scarier It still has the thgs  that made the first three books hilarious the Quiddch Wld Cup is very  funny All  all 's as good as all the other books  has a few new  surprises Read 
This book is up to the hightest expectations you could set! The first capter starts wh Ld Voldemts whereabouts  thenmoves on to Harry Potter himself
When I reached the end of the book I was a b puzzled didn't really seem like the plot was all that me complex than theother books yet the book was twice the length of the others but at the same time there really wasn't any wasted spaceIn any case the book was enjoyable  contues the overall sty well  like the other books is better than the predecesss Also I would suggest parents thk of this book not as &quottoo long&quot but as a good value there's an awful lot of book to keep your children occupied f a long timeAs rumoured there is a death  this book but  is hled well  is somethg the children should be prepared to deal whIf anythg anticipation f the next book is heightened even me wh this book watch f Harry Potter mania to grow not dimish
I am so exced to be wrtg this! I have just read one of  the coolest books wrten f a while! And I've read a lot! This book was well a lot dferent than the others  the series  The plot is just too good f wds  I won't spill  because many of you  haven't read  yet But I will tell you the most of the rumms were toaly  wrong  the mushy stuff  the death did happen although not like  anyone expected  to  Not to mention new characters funny  evil   crters this book is awsome!
Oh my gosh Rowlg did  aga! This book is amazg I thought  was gog to follow the usual plot: somethg comes up wh Voldemt  Harry saves the day but I was wrong  This new book is full of strong emotions this book doesn't seem to conta the sureness that everythg is gog to  be all right  Harry is gog to come out on top  After I read the book  I felt just like Harry: depressed The romance  the book kda confused  me  threw me off the plot  wasn't like I expected at all And you  know all those rums people posted about the book weren't true they were  totally off!  ~hehe- serves them right~ Well  sht the book is wth  every penny of the price  I highly recommend 
From the moment you open this book you are swept to a magical wld of wizards dragons  magic The fourth book  this series The Goblet Of Fire is the best One reads about the adventures of a fourteen year old  wizard--trag Harry Potter Accompanied by his two close friends Ron   Hermoe Harry must learn to use his magic as well as fight agast  Dark wizards who are out to kill him Buy this book  I'm sure you won't  be disappoted How could millions of kids be wrong?
My first impression after readg the book was how similar  was to the Star Wars movies when they first came out Everyone anxiously awaed The Empire Strikes Back but as the bad guys seemed me powerful  kept the  heroes on the run throughout many fans were disappoted THE GOBLET OF  FIRE is very similar as Ld Voldemt returns to power  keeps all our  heroes strugglg to keep up wh himTHE GOBLET OF FIRE as promised by  J K Rowlg is a much darker sty than the first 3 books There's lots  of action throughout as we follow Harry to the Wld Quiddch Cup   August  then to Hogwarts f the school year  the first Triwizard  Tournament  ages Due to the high death toll  previous tournaments  they had been discontued so everyone is a b apprehensive Students  from 2 other wizardry schools  Europe have been ved to participate   only the most seni students (17 years old) may enter their names to  the Goblet of Fire The Goblet selects one student from each of the 3  schools as entrants so image everyone's surprise when a  4th person is  selected--Harry! But who placed his name  the Goblet of Fire? Danger  abounds  every tournament eventWe see our old friends  meet many  new characters As always the people  Harry's wld are well drawn   very terestg I would have liked to see me day-to-day le at  Hogwarts as that has always been the most fun f me In spe of runng  over the entire year we see very ltle of classes as the book  concentrates me on the tournament The book ends after the tournament is  over but don't expect a nice resolution to the sty The characters are  busy planng avenues of attack agast Ld Voldemt which sets thgs  up f Book 5 Be sure to read these books  der as each builds on the  previous
This book is typical of the other Harry Potter episodes I've read Although I am begng to realize somethg about them  I have to say the Goblet of Fire is well wrten I couldn't put  down But this  doesn't shone out a few facts These books by JK Rowlg are  depictg scenarious of usg magic spells cantations  the like   turng them to seemg like  is fun  some st of game I've been  open to actual practices of the like  I can tell you  is no game   fact  is que dangerous And JK Rowlg is poisong young mds to  believg  is somethg good No matter how the magic may help Harry  Potter what kd of mals are you wantg your children to learn when  they beg thkg can get anythg they want through magic? There are  better ways of excersizg a child's imagation I won't discred  JK Rowlg f her gt f wrg she has made terestg adventures  I enjoy readg them  I feel  is only safe f one to read as long as  one is aware of the truth between the les of text This is not  somethg I'd want my ltle brothers  sister readg whout first  learng about the truth of magicAs f the plot/style of the  Goblet of Fire I rank  a 4 f beg well wrten  But I thk book 2   3 were slightly better To each their own
I am amazed that JK Rowlg has managed to put together such a delightful book even  the face of all the hype  I would recommend this series  this book to anyone of any age  Book 4 drew me  quickly   I fished   8 hours  I just hope book 5 comes out quickly  Huzzah  f Harry!
I am 14 years old I am proably one of the first people  the USA  maybe  the wld to fsh the book! I read from 11:00 am to 8:30 pm This book is terric  brgs  new ideas  make Harry seem me real! I  loved this book! It had all new twists  turns that the other Potter  books didn't have It was a b scarier  me adventure makg  seem  like when I was readg I was there Her use of character  detials made   even me amazgEven thought the age thg on the book says 9-12  I thk this book is open to all readers! It is a great book  the others   the series are just as goood I thk out of the series so far this book  is the best!JK Rowlg is a great fictional wrer I thk the best  thg a fictional wrer can do is to make you exp your imagation   to make you thk could this really happen? I thk JK Rowlg has done  that! She the mystical wld of Harry Potter come alive! She is my favtie  auth now! Thanks JK Rowlg f helpg me exp my imagation   open my wld to new ideas! I hope I can wre as well as you one day!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the latest stallment  the Harry Potter series is defely NOT just f children This 734 page novel is of the highest qualy  labellg  a &quotkids' book&quot would be  like callg Tolkien a children's auth JK Rowlg draws you to  Harry's wld from the first sentence fillg you wh excement at the  Wld Quiddch Cup fear when the Death Eaters show themselves hope  durg the Triwizard Tournament  outright terr when Harry comes  face-to-face wh He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Rivetg until the last  punctuation mark Harry Potter 4 will keep young  old alike on the edges  of their seats Full marks f Ms Rowlg
This was the best book yet  Wh each book JK Rowlg brgs to le one of leratures most unfgettable characters  She brgs you to a wld that is so unique  enchantg you end up  smilg  sad because  you didn't want the book to end  This book does get a ltle darker than  the other three but  sets the tone I thk f what is to come   future booksBuy  read   live the le of Harry Potter  You  won't be sry you did
I've just spent the day readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire--now how long til Book 4?  Harry seems to be growg up  I thought all the ma characters were much me terestg  complicated  this book  than they have been  I suppose there's que a lot of dference between  11  14  Harry Ron  Hermione are still entirely likeable  there  are some imptant changes  their relationships brewg  Many new  characters are troduced here as well  obviously many of them will be  recurrg characters  Harry's last years at Hogwarts  I was particularly  terested  what happened wh Snape!The book is tightly plotted   very tense  I wouldn't recommend  f young readers-- you thought  the dements were scary wa until the end of this book!  But 's  defely up to the hype  will have readers wag f the next  stallment
The book was wth the wa  I'm glad the book was availableat a local bookste on July 8  I started readg the book at 9:00pm couldn't put  down  It was the best Harry Potter book ever  JK Rowlg's imagation is unbelievable! She kept me guessg until the end  The endg is not at all what I expected  The servant was only troduced  the 3rd to the last chapter but Rowlg was able to make his connection wh the other charactersI can't wa f Harry Potter Book 5!
I won't ru the plot f those of you who have not yet readthe book but I want to emphasize that the series keeps gettg better better  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is absolutely grippg -- you will probably fd  dficult  not impossible to put downI am creasgly impressed by JK Rowlg's abily to weave together so many disparate details to create these amazg tapestries of wizardg le  She develops seemgly m details mentioned  the first three books to elements tegral to the plotOne warng f younger readers  their parents: Rowlg wasn't kiddg when she said the endg is scary  I suggest fishg the book durg daylight hours to allow some lagtime befe bedtime  E ND
The latest stallment of the Harry Potter (a name we have come to know  love) saga had me hooked I recieved  the day  came out  read nonstop f 4 hours  27 mutes until the last page turng climax had ended Admedlly the fer pot escaped me but i got the gist This is  the best Harry Potter yet Murder deciet treachery mystery hum   romance all packed to 752 pages  I heartily awa the the seventh book  because I know  will be the golden peak of childeren's lerature I  would like to commend JK Rowlg f revievg our imagations   warmg our hearts  the way that only a truly good book can
I just fished harry potter 4  stayed up sce midnight the day i got  to fish  i loved   i thk that even though  is her longest  is one of jk rowlg's best books yet! i can't wa until she releases the next one  i suggest this one f everyone young  old!
Book 4 was awesome! I stayed up f most of Saturday night readg   just fished  this mng I didn't want to stop but I also didn't want  to end Now I'm st of sad that 's overWhat can I say? Rowlg was right on wh this one as she was wh the other three Most  of the rums I heard were true--the Quiddch Wld Cup does happen f  example  Harry starts to see girls  a whole new light The sty does  get a b soap-y at times but 's not bad I won't ru the other  surprises f those who haven't fished  yetI will say that I am  sooo amazed that Rowlg ( her readers) can keep track of such a  complicated sty Each book gets a ltle darker adds me characters  has me threads to tie together But the characters also become me  three-dimensional the danger a ltle me real Maybe that's why people  are so drawn to  Me I can't wa to fd out what happens  Book 5
It was wh some trepidation that I first viewed this book -- where else could the sties go? are we gog to have a repetion  a stretchg of what was so charmg  the first books?  Surprise surprise: The latest  Harry Potter adventure is twice the size  twice as good as the last  Unlike some wrers of ever-expg sequels to popular best-sellers Ms  Rowlg mapped out her plan f seven books befe wrg even one of  them: a classic wng lerary strategy  The books do not get thner   every sense of the wd but deeper  The pot of view also matures  wh Harry  the wrg becomes me complex The books are not so much  a series as a set as we see  trilogies  quartets each brgg us  somethg me each roundg out the sty me[STOP]  As an  educat the value I see  these books is that they are engagg wrten   the old al sty-teller style  which each episode  chapter ends  wh a question leavg the reader to anticipate the next  It is also  lerally &quota page turner&quot as the pages also are set up to leave  us anticipatg the next  However &quotengagg&quot alone is not  enough  Students have the pleasure of discoverg f themselves how a  book can capture their imagations  transpt them to another place  peopled wh characters  settgs  suations described by the auth   fleshed out  given le by the reader  Meover we have  these  books an excellent use of the wrten language  terms of the academic  conventions of structure  punctuation as well as  the use of  terestg vocabulary -- a good model all around [STOP]  Teachers:  don't rob your students of the opptuny to discover the pleasure of  readg of the prted wd f themselves by readg this aloud to them  (You'll also be able to avoid the odd objection based on the tle  what  was heard on the grapeve  circulated on a photocopied collection of  excerpts out of context) If you yourself want to read  by all means do  so but read  at home You'll know what 's all about  be able to  discuss  wh those who have read   discovered the power of the  prted wd [STOP]  What an credible &quotteachable moment&quot this  book  s predecesss have presented!

This book is the greatest book of the Harry Potter series so far Everythg ties   there is so much suspence JK Rowlg keep on wrg great books!
I've just fished readg HP4 twice All I can do is to gawkat Rowlg's skill [] As she promised the book is deed pivotal  dark full wh surprises The troduction is slow then the action moves fast  furiously from that pot The Quiddch Wld Cup  the Tasks are examples I laughed hard when Moody humiliated Malfoy I don't see how Rowlg can top this book By the way I thk there's somethg gog on between Ron  Hermione
I thk Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire holds up the tradion of greatness The fact that there are so many characters from previous books makes readg  me fun Also because the first chapter holds an air of  mystery  is impossible to put the book down once you start Even    has over six hundred pages  only seems to have just over a hundred But   those pages happess confidence  saddness all collide to brg  about a truely amazg endg
What can I say? Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was the most eagerly awaed book  histy by both children  adults alike   did not disappot Like the previous three from the start  had me hooked  I  fished  the day I got  The Goblet of Fire is far longer than the  other books beg twice the size of The Prisoner of Azkaban which is  great because  allows f a me complex plot  greater detailIt  follows the trend set by `Azkaban'  beg slightly darker than the  previous two  we see less of that fairy tale magic although there is  still enough there to make this book as enchantg as the othersI thk  of all the Harry Potter books this is my favoure so far Beg slightly  older than the target readg audience (10/11 year olds) I preferred the  darker side to the plot  the amount of suspense  the way the auth  manages to have you fearg f Harry's le It is also good to see Harry  Ron  Hermione begng to grow up  we see the three go on their  first datesUnftunately apart from the Wld Cup match between  Irel  Bulgaria at the start of the book there are no Quiddch  matches between the four houses The annual Quiddch cup is replaced by a  triwizard tournament where Hogwarts competes wh two other wizardg  schools which fills a large part of the book  adds some excg twists   turns to the bookAll the usual characters are volved as well as  some new ones cludg Ra Skeeter a repter f the Daily Prophet who  plagues Harry throughout the book  Mad-Eye Moody the latest  a long  le of Defence agast the Dark Arts teachersAs usual JK Rowlg  wres a magnicent sty wh a complicated plot some how managg to  weave all the ty details together The book has a spectacular fish  perhaps her best yet  leaves several un-answered questions ready f  book 5 The book gives the impression of beg a turng pot  the  series  several big events happen which seem certa to have a big  impact on the remag books In books one  two we were troduced to  the characters  book three a lot of the background was filled  In  book 4 the action really begs  rather than beg a complete sty the  way the other three were this seems to serve as the begng to a much  bigger sty one that will contue through all the books  the  seriesLike all the others Goblet of Fire manages to successfully blend  humour supense  mystery  keeps the reader guessg to the end  Not  many children between the ages of 7  12 could fail to be impressed by  this  the Harry Potter books are rare  the way that they manage to  enchant both adults  children alike In sht: this book is fantastic  my favoure of the series so far but whether  will stay that way  depends on book 5This book was brilliant  I can't wa to read what  happens next! :)pot  the  series  several big events happen which seem certa to have a big  impact on the remag books In books one  two we were troduced to  the characters  book three a lot of the background was filled  In  book 4 the action really begs  rather than beg a complete sty the  way the other three were this seems to serve as the begng to a much  bigger sty one that will contue through all the books  the  seriesLike all the others Goblet of Fire manages to successfully blend  humour supense  mystery  keeps the reader guessg to the end  Not  many children between the ages of 7  12 could fail to be impressed by  this  the Harry Potter books are rare  the way that they manage to  enchant both adults  children alike In sht: this book is fantastic  my favoure of the series so far but whether  will stay that way  depends on book 5This book was brilliant  I can't wa to read what  happens next! :)
Children's lerature tends to be the great equalizer:   a book is good really good when you're a kid  will st up to repeated readgs throughout your le  J K Rowlg's Harry Potter series has managed to  captivate adults  children alike so much so that the advance publicy  f the fourth volume--HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE--has achieved  epic proptions  Could ANY book live up to all the hype?  In this case  the answer is: Yes  The sty begs as the  now 14-year-old Harry weathers another summer wh his hated  hateful  relations the Dursleys  eagerly looks fward to the Quiddch Wld  Cup to which he has been ved by his best friend Ron Weasley  But  Harry  the Weasleys soon have me on their mds than wizard spts:  a  series of bizarre  frighteng events unfold at the match that prove to  have lastg repercussions f all who attended  Back at Hogwarts f his fourth year Harry soon learns of another  surprise--namely the Triwizard Tournament a magical contest that is to  take place between Hogwarts  two me wizardg schools  Three  champions one chosen from each school by the Goblet of Fire compete  agast each other  feats of magical skill  darg  Owg to the high  risk fact volved however Headmaster Dumblede has decreed that only  students 17  older may subm their names f contention as school  champion  An trigued Harry looks fward to watchg the excement from  the sideles along wh pals Ron  Hermione  But on the day that the  champions are to be chosen the Goblet of Fire sps out the name of an  unprecedented fourth champion: Harry Potter  Shocked  me than a  ltle alarmed by this surprise development Harry now fds himself  competg agast much older students who regard him wh scn   hostily facg the jealousy of his peers (cludg Ron)   ultimately fightg not only f school hon but f his very le  HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE has rightly been  referred to as a pivotal stallment  the series f  is  this  volume that Harry makes the transion from child to adolescent  Besides  the Triwizard Tournament  the complications  brgs to his le Harry  is also contendg wh the problems of any nmal teenage boy such as the  onset of puberty  unrequed first love  School contues to present  s own challenges--the animosy between Harry  Potions Profess  Severus Snape remas undimished-- as rumed the death of a maj  character casts a shadow over Harry's le even as  claries the deal  that awas him  the future:  a fal confrontation wh the evil wizard  Ld Voldemt  A darker book than s  predecesss (though still possesg s trademark hum) GOBLET OF FIRE  tackles weightier themes adroly  wh sensivy  J K Rowlg's  wrg seems to have matured along wh her young hero  Put this volume  (after a satisfacty number of re-readgs) on the shelf beside s  precurss  wa  eager expectation f the fulfillment that is to  comePOTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE has rightly been  referred to as a pivotal stallment  the series f  is  this  volume that Harry makes the transion from child to adolescent  Besides  the Triwizard Tournament  the complications  brgs to his le Harry  is also contendg wh the problems of any nmal teenage boy such as the  onset of puberty  unrequed first love  School contues to present  s own challenges--the animosy between Harry  Potions Profess  Severus Snape remas undimished-- as rumed the death of a maj  character casts a shadow over Harry's le even as  claries the deal  that awas him  the future:  a fal confrontation wh the evil wizard  Ld Voldemt  A darker book than s  predecesss (though still possesg s trademark hum) GOBLET OF FIRE  tackles weightier themes adroly  wh sensivy  J K Rowlg's  wrg seems to have matured along wh her young hero  Put this volume  (after a satisfacty number of re-readgs) on the shelf beside s  precurss  wa  eager expectation f the fulfillment that is to  come
Stunng magnicat! Another wonderful piece! You aresurprised at the choses romances all to good fanng the flamesof Pottermania!
In my opion the best of all four books Some real surprises  some sadness The books are defetly takg a darker turn but the wrg  plottg are both first rate A ht Someone does die but I am not  tellg I had heard  but  kept me turng pages to fd out who If  you liked the previous books you should love this one The only complat I  had was that Harry didn't get to play Quidch (Read the book to fd out  why)  :)
Harry Ron  Hermone are here f an awesome action packed adventure!  The book was both excg  scary  I couldn't stop readg  until  was fished  This book is the best yet  the series  A character does die  the book so younger readers bewareI can't  wa to read the next book!
After readg the third stallment of the Harry Potter series (The Prisoner of Azkaban) I thought that this series couldn't get any better I however was very wrong When I bought the book I sat down  read all 734 pages  one day That day was a magic carpet ride of emotions This  book had  all  was funny very excg yet  was also frighteng   sad The book is filled to the brim wh unexpected turns at unexpected  times &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is the best book   the Harry Potter series hs down
I loved this book! The sty had a lot of surprises   I don't want go give away the plot (Not a lot anyway) One thg that surprised me was that a hogwarts student dies! Harry meets some old friends like Sirus Black   Dobby the house elf The new Defense agast the Dark Arts teacher is neat  too He has a Magical eye  is said to be mad The book was so goodI  stopped playg my new Ntendo 64  fished the book  one  a half  days!
I thk this book is just as excg as the first then the second then the third It's my fave book of the 4 so excg  thrillg! JK Rowlg really let's loose wh this book breaks all the rules she made   the past books  wres a book that''ll keep you readg f hours once  you fish the chapter she always ends them wh clf-hangers you just  want to read the next one  the next one!In the 4th book Harry comes  back to Hogwarts after the Wld Quiddch cup wh Ron  Hermione   the Weaslys gets a girlfriend Cho Chang experiences the Tri -Wizard  tournament  a dear character  the sty won't live to see the end of  the book so read !It's great i give  five  stars!
Wds cannot describe how absbg  mystyg this book is I just fished  after readg almost nonstop f the past 8 hours  have found I can do nothg but marvel at the amazgness of this book
The kids couldn't wa   was wth   They have been readg -   the summer!  They love the sty  although only the oldest has fished  they all are enjoyg every chapter  It's wth gettg   givg to help spire the excement of a good book  kids I get to read   next
Among the twistg plot JK Rowlg has yet aga contued the sty of Harry Potter  his unbelievable  humous friends  Harry has returned as strong  as magical as ever  has repeated the spell as strong at   was the first time the one that kept me up all night readg  left me  tired but happy come mng  Fun  allurg The Golbet of Fire has  defely found a home on bookshelf
Once aga Harry Potter does not fail to enthrall his fans  This is the most adult of all the books  the only danger is that small children who shouldn't be readg 700 page novels will be overwhelmed by the dark  frighteng  utterly absbg fale of this sty  If you don't let  your children watch PG-13 movies don't let them read this book whout  you!  I don't thk the news media will contue callg these books  &quotchildren's sties&quot after this addion  Older children   young adults fally have a series to sk their teeth to  Once aga  the sty is full of good agast evil conflicts of characters the idiocy  of (some) adults  the penalties of their own misbehavi  Enjoy   be ready to read this one aga  aga just like the others!
Ms Rawlgs is not lettg up as she moves on  The sty 700 pages  so though  may be moves fast  I couldn't help but stay up all night to fish  I wouldnt dare give away the endg here like so many  reviewers do  wh this book  would be a travesty suffice to to say  that  will be hard to keep a dry eye  you've followed the novels  Its  too bad she will only be wrg seven of these but I guess we cant have  everythg we want
you  your kids will engoy this book i guarenntee
I thoughly enjoyed this book The clusion of the Quiddch Wld Cup  the Triwizard Tournament at Hogwarts gave this book an excg twist The only problem I have is now I have to wa another year f Harry Potter  5!Also I was sad to see the only Quiddch game played beg the Wld Cup   not seeg Harry  the team try to defend the tle(not to mention  who would replace Oliver Wood!)
J K Rowlg has done  aga  I ran down to buy the book after oversleepg  rushed home wh   my arms  Fally i got home sat down on the sofa  opened another magical book  I read all day knowg  that i wouldn't be able to sleep until i had reached the end  I knew this  book was gog to be as spectacular  not me than the other three  Harry Potter books i had already read  It lived up to my expectations  The book had even me gasps (wh the Death-Eaters dragons   underwater scares) even me plot (wh Rs Skeeter Ld Voldemt  returng  surprisg twists wh the Polyjuice potion)  Yes i would  have to recommend  to anyone who is addicted to Harry Potter   fact anyone who is strange enough not to have read Harry Potter  I just  can't wa f the next one to come out  I am the same age as Harry  Potter so that perhaps makes the books even me realistic f me  But  anyone child  adult is guaranteed to enjoy the delights of HP
I just fished readg this book  It is wonderful but  would be a ltle b too scary f younger children because 1  There is lots of violence 2  All of the swearg All  all I like this book better than the rest  I cannot wa until the fth one
I cant believe JK Rowlg did  aga  I bought the book  stayed up til 7:00  the mng readg   I couldnt put  down  This is the best of the Harry poter books I have read
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a really good book The sty contues wh Harry gog to see the Wld cup wh the Weaselys  Hermione Voldemt rises to power  gets a body We see a return of  Pettigrew aka Wmtail We hear me from Sirius  Harry gets to  compete  the Triwizard Tournament wh Cedric Diggy It has been  rumed that someone  the book was gog to die  's true I'm not  gog to say who  is but I WILL say a few thgs: the person is a  Quiddch player  is not  Gryffd Most of the Harry Potter books  so far had happy endgs This one didn't because the death of a character  happened near the end Although the endg was kd of sad I liked this  book the most of all because sce I'm a fast reader I usually read HP  books  about 1-2 hours but this one took me about 5! I recommend this  book to everyone of all ages I've read many masterpieces  I must say  that this book is the most amazg book that I've ever read! (And that's  sayg a lot too!)
'The Goblet of Fire': such a name conjures up images of a Grail quest  Rowlg's prose has dealt wh such dark issues befe  she herself announced that a character is set to die  this novel  And also that  Harry has a growg terest  girls  You can't help but try to speculate  what's gog to happen  this book the clues are so tantalizg  I st  of guessed crectly who Harry's squeeze was gog to be but Rowlg  completely surprised me wh the identy of the deceased  The secrecy  surroundg Harry Potter 4 was done very well  the book me than lives  up to your expectations  There was the creased secury f all  bookshops although one resourceful girl sneaked a copy out  read   (she must have done a gone back  time charm)  Grgotts are most  displeased that she managed to steal a copy past the massive three-headed  dog that was guardg   However  may have been unwise f them to  choose Fluffy  The girl was seen carryg a gramophone player at the  time  Never md  Harry Potter himself has placed a silencg charm  upon her f she has not yet revealed the plot (although this may also be  due to the sheer vastness of the book which seems to be double  even  triple the usual Potter)  Secret preparations were  place f the  dispatch of the book  The Hogwarts Express was pressed to service   every owl practiced wh weights f a ftnight  Even Buckbeak was  allowed back from exile  der to do his b  The passwd had to be  changed from 'Pig Snout' sce muggle secury guards seemed to fd this  offensive Everythg had to be right f the biggest spell of magic ever  The muggles thk 's fiction but we know better  I thk the ma  appeal of Rowlg's books is not the character of Potter himself (most  often the visg protagonists are much better sketched than the boy  himself)  Sce all the novels revolve about Potter I sometimes thk  that  would be better to see Hogwarts through his eyes  the first  person  However Rowlg bewches you wh her plots which are superb  I hear 's a seven book series  I believe that Rowlg knows exactly  what's gog to happen  the end  Each volume seems to have clues f  future books  now appear to be much me open ended  thus me  compulsive  Certaly pre-ders f Harry Potter 5 are gog to break  even me recds  bookshopsHogwarts self seems to have come  from Walpole's 'Castle of Otranto' wh s ghosts  lively patgs  However Hogwarts is both far me benign  malign than Otranto  that  makes any sense  Certaly Rowlg's prose is me polished than  Walpole's  Although the narrative is very modern there are que a few  healthy references to the past  I love Rowlg's use of Lat her playg  wh wds  If anythg though I would probably want to branch Rowlg  off to the me adult wrg of Christopher Fowler  Joanne Harris  Harris certaly has the same love of the Gothic the Pre-Raphaele  patgs  last but not least chocolate  In 'Blackberry We'  Harris' latest novel there is just about the same high regard f the  media as Rowlg produces here  'The Goblet of Fire'  I thk that most  auths cannot but help put what they know to their wrg  I thk  Rowlg's sudden celebry has added a powerful gredient to these novels  especially this one  What's most attractive about this series of novels  is the narrative progression  Rowlg lets Harry Potter grow up befe our  eyes so the books should become me mature as they go on  Harry Potter's  certaly no Bart Simpson  Peter Pan fever trapped  childhood - but  there's no doubt that he's every b as immtal as they are  I thk his  appeal lies not  his beg a fabulous wizard but  the fact that he is  so human  He's not a totally virtuous hero he's not wher than whe   is me than capable of spe  mischief  This makes him a far me  terestg protagonist  his fight agast evil a battle he only  conducts due to the dire circumstances of his parents' murder  But  Rowlg's proved befe that she can make you twist  turn wh her  fiction  There are plenty of surprises  this new book which I'll not  reveal  Let's just say that you hope that Harry Potter has much better  fm than most English sptsmen seem to have at the moment Of course you  have to read all the books   sequence to get proper enjoyment out of  them  The Goblet of Fire is a very long book but like Harry himself  you'll be racg towards the end  This is the best book  the Harry  Potter series -

If you've ever read a book  liked  alot you'll have the same feelg wh this but times 100 It is mixed wh lots of emotions Sad funny happy scared It is a great book overall Defately get !
First  femost i must say that this is an credible book  I picked up a copy of the fourth Harry Potter book today  i was taken aback at the sheer size of the book  I planned on readg just a ltle  b at a time (the other books  the series were sht enough to read   one stg) but one hour of readg turned to two  three i  fally fished around midnight  was left wh the satisfaction of  readg the best book i have  a long time  It excells as the  others have at immersg you to the Harry Potter wld captivatg your  senses  sendg you through the emotional roller-coaster of Harry's  fourth year at Hogwarts The book deals wh many issues that the others  have hted at: friendship trust love  death The strikg presence  of death is what changes the wld  this pivotal book Rowlg has opened  the do past bluffs  threats to a villa who is believably   truly evil This has opened up new levels of fear that made the book me  tense to read The broader range of emotions has made this a deeper   me somber book but even better  me thought-provokg than the  last  Rowlg has once aga  a brilliant book brought the wizardg  wld to le aga
I'll adm  I was wried  #4 would live up to the hype After fishg  though I am not sure why I did The book did not read like most 700+ page novels I have read - there were no long drawn-out passages  that should have been on the cuttg room flo It lived up to the  wonderful heights JK Rowlg has achieved wh the previous three  stallments F those of you who have been readg the rums of what  occurs  &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot on the Internet-some predictions  were accurate  some were not In the end however the only thg I can  really say is 's gog to be a long wa until next summer  book 5
I liked Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire because of the excement  the thrillg suprise endg  I really liked the big event that happened at Hogwarts (It has somethg to do wh the goblet of Fire)  It was a  great book  Ron Harry   Hermione are better friends then everHagrid  has another dark secret  Voldemt is wag f his chance  Dumblede  has his ways  Fudge is blunderg along The Harrry Potter books are my  fave books
Fally 's here!  This book was fantasticI read  cover to cover the day  came out  If you've read the first three books be prepared  The Goblet of Fire is much me serious than the others however  is  beautully wrten  rich  character  The plot is an tricate  suspenseful oneI won't give anythg awayread  f yourself!  Excellent summer readg although you may not be able to put  down once  you pick  up
This is defely the best Potter book so far! I don't want to spoil anythg though The book's 754 pages  I read  3 times  a couple days!
Our family woke up today at 8:00 went to the ste  picked up a copy of this great book Lucky me i got to read  first It is the best Harry Potter book  the series so far i thk I just loved  It was way  excg  not at all predictable I spent from 9:00 this mng to 5:00  tonight readg  i fished!   was a great book!
The fourth book of the Harry Potter series  is very good  Irated  five stars because of s outstg detail  very goodplot  The Goblet of Fire really plays a small part  the sty I thk  should have been called Harry Potter  the Triwizard Tournament  This book is 734 pages 37 chapters long  I would recommend this book to people the like Sci-fi  Fantasy
The first book was great  The second was amazg  The third was stupendous  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is so great  is nearly describable  It has the best plot that I've read  all my le  JK Rowlg has come out wh another best seller!  I just can't wa to read  the next three books  get further caught up  the adventures of Harry  Hermione Ron the Durselys  of course Ld Voldemt all of the  professs at Hogwarts  anyone  anythg else that stumbles to the  plotle!  Simply spectacular!
I've just fished readg &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot   is just as amazg ( not me) as the earlier three edions It had me riveted from the begng to the end I like the way Harry seems to  be facg the same problems as nmal kids such as dealg wh loneless  to misunderstgs wh his friends  havg beg rejected by a girl  besides havg to cope wh Ld Voldermt :0) I would highly recommend  this book because 's not just another book on wchcraft  scery but  a sty which touches the heart as well Besides descriptions of dancg  veelas disastrous magic classes  slherg serperts are altogether  spell-bdg!
I am a ten year old girl (Eddy's daughter Nicole) I picked up the book at the release party at midnight  read the whole thg  one dayIt was so excg! The suspense was great At the Triwizard Tournament (my fave part) Harry had to fight a dragon go underwater to save Ron   get through a dangerous maze  All my fave characters were back  It  seemed like Hagrid might get fired Harry could have died several times  Hermione was her usual self  Then of course I was anxious to see who   was that was gog to die (We all knew someone would) The biggest scare  of the book is when Voldemt rises aga  a new body  duels wh  Harry I don't want to spoil the end so I won't tell you what happens  If  you love Harry Potter you have to read the Goblet of Fire  It's  fantastic!
This volume  the Harry Potter series is the best one! Fromthe thrill of a new event to seeg other students from otherwizardg schools the whole thg is a great read It's also a good laugh from the Floo Powder escapade to the Ton Tongue toffeesyou'll have to read  to fd out me! Also a b dark after the death of a character
I thk that I speak f everyone out there when I say howexced I was to fally get my hs on this book!  I just fishedreadg all 734 pages  JK Rowlg has truly outdone herself wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  Year four is a very dferent one f all the Hogwarts students- There will be no school quiddch(gasp!)  Voldemt  his followers contually ga power throughout the year there is a particularly troublesome news repter  many other mysterious  odd charachters f Harry Ron  Hermione to ponderThe plot was entertag wh a very suprisg yet ftg endg  The book has all of JKR's humour trademark creative names  new quirky charachters The Goblet is another one f the recdbooks  f the enjoyment of children of all ages!  After The shock at the end of the book JK leaves us wh a b of a clf-hanger f book five(sigh) we will all have to wa patiently( impatiently)until next time!  We will at least have a vague Idea of where the plot has to go next year after all the myriad happengs this year at Hogwarts!
In her latest Harry Potter book JK Rowlg once aga brgs vividly to le the fascatg wld of wches  wizards  Yet on this go-around the characters are a ltle me sophisticated a ltle me telligent   even a ltle funnier  Ron Weasley seems to have grown up the most   his sense of hum is a delight throughout the book  Even Hermione  takes thgs a ltle me  stride  The developg relationship between  these two is even me proof that Rowlg is aware of the changes  her  readers On the whole this book is filled wh fascatg magic fierce  struggles between good  evil detailed characterizations  pla old  suspense  Harry Potter might be the ma character but he would be  leless   were not f the enchantg wld  which he lives  This  is another excellent book from JK Rowlg so don't let the length bother  you 734 pages fly by  no time  soon you're left wag f the next  adventures of Harry Potter
The fourth of the Harry Potter books begs dferently than the last two which makes f an excg new twist  the sty  Harry is joed once aga by familiar characters  some new ones Ron's older brothers are  great addions to the sty I expecially liked the return of Dobby   Moang Myrtle  the way they helped Harry wh the tasks set befe him  It was not too surprisg to fd that Lucius Malfoy is still a suppter  of Voldemt  that once aga Harry survived his latest encounter wh  him  Almost twice as long as all the other books all the pages are wth  !  All secrets are revealed at the end but this one has a b of a  clfhanger which will have everyone anxious f book #5
F younger readers's a b scarybut a very imptant book  the seriesI read this book  13 hoursI just couldn't put  down!And as Harry's wld at Hogwarts becomes me  me dangerousI don't thk  you'll be able to put  down eherbecause Voldemt is becomg  stronger!
The fourth stallment of Harry Potter defately lives up to all the excement  anticipation Despe the 700+ page count I read the book  mere hours: I simply could not stop readg I am an avid reader   never befe has any other book cludg the previous Harry Potter's  affected me this much I was shakg when I fshed  was that good!  There are plenty of dangers  excement a suprisg plot twist  characteristic of Rowlg  even plenty of laughs (Fred  Gege go at   aga) I was especially delighted when characters from previous books  showed up aga (I won't say who though :) ) And the endg is by far the  best  most tense  also the most leadg wh just enough strgs  left to make you go crazy f the fth I yelled when I fished I was  that anxious to read the fth one!  In sht this book surpasses any  other that I've read  I've read a lot I am now gog back to my room to  reread 
Harry Potter IV is the best book yet  In the very begng  entrances you  pulls you  to read  me  me  From start to fish i couldn't put  down  Everybody should have this book
I just fished my copy of Harry Potter # 4 Goblet of fire  I am very impressed Not only does the book come off just as good  better than the last the series seems to be &quotheatg up&quot to some serious  action between Harry  Voldemt (is that spelled right)  Defately a  wthy success to the previous books I see the openg of a larger  plot on the hizonGreat book f anyone 10  up ( my humble  opion)
The Harry Potter books are all awesome!  They all deserve five stars  The books are wrten  a way that once you start readg  you can't put  down because you want to know what happens next!  By my opion the fourth  book is the best so far!  I read the whole fourth book (734 pages)  one  day  The best thg that I liked  the fourth book is the Triwizard  Tournament  Harry gets picked mysteriously to be  the tournament even  though he is not old enough  I thk everyone should read the Harry Potter  books!
This book is undoubtedly the best of the series  If you liked the other ones you will doubly love this one *PLUS*  is extra long!  It's got everythg you could want  a book so read !
the fourth harry potter book is dferent from any of the books so far  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is much me frighteng  serious than the last three  It is sad scary funny  a fabulous book  It has  romance the first time we've seen 
The day that I got this book I couldn't put  down  read well to the night This book though very long had no wasted wds This book was certaly excg rivg  kept me on the edge of my seat A must read f everyone even  you haven't read the rest of the series oeoe
Wow JK Rowlg has aga wrten a novel not to befgotten The crazy adventures of Harry  his friends aga supriseeven the most methodical readers I'm 11  today at 9:00 am we received our copy of Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire via FedEx from Amazon Five hours later I fished the book Many new adventures confront Harry from the rise of the Dark Ld Voldemt to Harry's first school dance Harry also discovers girls  sees his first Quiddch Wld Cup Keep them comg JK! This series is the best although I must adm the book is rather slow until about the 25th page  the endg was a b disappotg Hope you enjoy !
Rowlg has done  aga Once me she lets us vis wh her wonderful friends It's a lengthy tale which one would be hard pressed to fish  one stg but well wth your time Rowlg uses her own magic  the  fm of her wds to weave a sty  characters that appeal to both the  young  old I'm a 28 yo man who has proudly recommended the book  series to not only my friend's children but to my friends as well This is  truly somethg that can be enjoyed by both adults  children alike  (lerary equivalent to a trip to Disney) Pick this one up  you wont be  disappoted (you also wont be able to put  down until your done)
This is JK Rowlg's best so far I loved  so much I fished   one stg!  (I received the book from Amazoncom on July 8 2000) Excg thgs kept on happeng so I never wanted to put my bookmark  the bookHarry has to deal wh many new problems  go on three  unexpected adventures All the new characters create new twists  turns  that make this a memable styThis is a must read f all Harry  Potter fans! Buy this book you will want to read  over  over aga
I should give this book 3  1/2 stars firstly But anyway  the first three Harry Potter books events were maly concentrated around the gogs-on at the school friends enemies teachers  annoyances Thgs  happened that helped them Ick I knew I couldn't say this right This is a  good book has some funny parts  some cool ones besides 's  Harry Potterbut  is very dferent Very much darker It is all about  Voldemt comg backhe needed Harry to complete him He  killedsomeone he called back his Death Eaters The creeps  thaterick! Seeg Voldemt's sign is a creepy experience  the  book leaves you wh the feelg that there is me to come much me  was creepy However J K Rowlg was right when she said that everyone  fell  love wh the wrong people Also Ron  Hermione's relationship  changed The book just was well creepydarkerme evilurgghhh! I  don't know! In my opion the other three were better It's pretty long  but I read   6 hoursI should've gone to bed but  was too creepy  after seeg the skull  the snake
Harry Potter  The Goblet Of Fire is the best book i have read  years! Wh wonderfull  characters  brgg back some you know from the previous books  even gettg rid of one (fever) this book as all the  thgs a good book should a nice sty wonderfull characters  the magic  that makes you never wanna put the book down  I give Harry Potter  The  Goblet Of Fire 5 stars wich  defly deserves!
i loved every part of this book  i thk harry goes really well wh cho chang  the tournament  the quiddch wld cup both were really neat  i learned a lot about the wizardg wld outside hogwarts
JK Rowlg's 4th book is wonderful Even up to the 3rd chapterthe mystery is still there So many weird  suprisg thgs arehappeng  this book And I'm only up to third chapter The way she wres keeps you terested  what the rest of the book has  ste This book is truly one to buy f kids who don't really like to read  even yourselff some laughs  thrills!
An excellent novel recomended f both Muggles  Potter fans  The begng is a b tedious wh backwrg but the book soon reaches a high level of excement which mantas throughout  The endg is a b  of a surprise but wh the typical Rowlg twist everythg turns out OK  Or so  seems
It's rare to fd a book series where each stallment keeps gettg better  better but the Harry Potter series is one Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire doesn't just contue the Harry Potter mythos  broadens   deepens  Clockg  at a hefty 700-plus pages  might be a ltle  too heavy to peruse  the bathtub but 's such a swt read that I  knocked  off  one afternoon Part of the fun of a series like this one  is that you get to meet old friends aga like Ron Hagrid Hermione   Dumblede while you also get the opptuny to meet new Rowlg  creations like Mad-Eye Moody the new Defense Agast the Dark Arts  Teacher who has a magical eye that can detect falsehood (very convenient  f students makg up excuses about their homewk)  see through  visibily cloaks (much to Harry's alarm) Harry contends wh a host of  new challenges  this book both magical (of course)  non-magical  (Harry's crush on the pretty  popular Cho Chang offers him as many  stomach-clenchg moments as a Quiddch match)I was afraid that as the  books got darker  me complex  their themes the hum might be lost  but never fear: Rowlg's w only serves to make the darker passages me  effective   some cases very movg Verdict: read !
This book was very thrillg  I read  every moment possible! This book was most defately the best  the series I recommend this book to ages 7  above This book is a b deceivg but  was rewardg to read
This book is great! After readg the first three I was hooked  had to get the 4th  read  right away! Wonderful book f all ages!
I got to the bookste 10 mutes befe midnight  I reserved the book 3 months earlier knowg  would be huge  It was all over the news  Fally I got   I was the 5th person  the ste to get  at  approximately 12:04 AM Saturday mng  I began readg  when I woke  up at 9 am  I sat there on the `crouch' readg  until 7:02 PM  This  is a huge book  From the first chapter `The Riddle House' to the last  chapter `The Begng'  We learn so much (the followg is NOT a  spoiler!) We learn why Hagrid's so tall who Harry has a crush on why  Snape is on his `second chance'  If Lucius Malfoy is really evil I could  not put the book down  JK Rowlg has done  aga  Wh the  side-characters such as Dobby  Moang Myrtle makg a return  We learn  of rival wizard/wchg schools  YES there are American Wizards!  The  sty ends  a clfhanger but I will not tell you how
If you had any doubt that JK Rowlg could produce anotherbook as sensational as her first three put them to rest rightnow &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is  the eyes of this Harry fan perfect  It's darker scarier  me excg than the first three books  But  spe of girls  other perils Harry is still the Harry we all loveHighlights of &quotGoblet of Fire&quot clude the new characters from Durmstrang  Beauxbatons Fred  Gege Weasley's hilarious ventions  -  case you're still wonderg - Hermione's lessons on how to pronounce her name  The best part though is the end  Whout givg too much away let me just say we're left wh the sense that Harry's wld is about to become substantially bigger  The only downside is that now we have to wa f book 5    but  the meantime I thk I'll go read this one aga
(actually this is from Soo Sun's 12 yr old who's read all the Harry Potter books  Yes we waed  le at midnight to get our copy  he has DEVOURED all 700+ pages  the last two days) Yes  lives up to the hype  The new Harry Potter book is excellent  The imagive  creationsterestg styles  plot twists are amazg  The  character teraction is superb  they act  respond to their  surroundgs just as children their age should  If anyone tells you 's  not wth  igne them because this is a wonderful book f anyone
The &quotGoblet of Fire&quot lives up to all theprepublication hype There's enough action  adventure  this tleto delight  enthrall any reader I was up until 4:00  the mng because I could not bear to fall asleep whout knowg how the book ended The adventures of Harry Ron  Hermione  their fourth year at Hogwarts will be sure to keep you readg I am keepg this review free of details so that each reader will be able to experience the sty f themselves But  you want specics there is enough magic adventure  hum to make you wish to read Year 5 right away!
Ms Rowlg has done  aga wh the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot begs wh Harry  his muggle family the Dursleys then to the Quiddch Wld  Cup wh the Weasleys  His start of the fourth year there is a new Dark  Arts teacher Mr &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody who is a friend of Arthur  Weasley  It weaves us through a tale of Harry's classes  le durg  his fourth year Instead of a Quiddch match wh each house of Hogwarts  there is a Tri-Wizard Tournament volvg two other Wizardg schools  that contues throughout the school year  There is a Yule Ball too to  add some awkwardness f the young wizards  wches livesMs Rowlg  also wres of new an terestg characters a house-elf named Wky (yes  Dobby makes an appearance) a yellow journalist named Ra Skeeter  a  wonderful Quiddch player named Vikt Krum just to name a few  There is  the usual sprklg of wizardg tools (ptkeys omnioculars etc)   treats too  In addion we are also given the crect pronounciation of  Hermoe's nameThe book is much darker  longer than the previous  three  If you are considerg readg  to a child who cannot read   herself/himself I'd suggest you look elsewhere f somethg better sued  f the age of your child
Recieved the book at 8am yesterday mng(thanks Amazon)  read  every chance I got It almost lives up to the hype but  here's a big but 's much darker  sister than the previous three If you have read  Harry Potter to your children you may want to read  first(good excuse   what!) I'm not talkg about Stephen Kg dark but 's somethg to be  aware ofAnyway Enjoy  I did!
This book is by far the best of the series so far  JK Rowlg has spent me time weavg the sty  addg many elements that weren't present  the earlier books  Even though this book is geared f children I feel  that older teens  college students will enjoy   It is wonderful  children's fantasy whout beg childish
The fourth book  the magnicent Harry Potter series is as good  not better than the others We meet the other Weasleys we go to the quiddch cup  we expierence the Triwizard competion an event that hasn't  taken place  over a century The endg of the book is que frightng  but well wren There is a death that was very sad I really loved the  book  I couldn't stop readg  f ne straight hours! It is long  (734) but no wd is wasted
a great book that will have you sad  happy (mostly sad) I thought that  was too long (754 pages)  could of been shoarted
JK Rowlg has done  aga  She's produced anotherspellbdg sty (I read this  one day)  the series  The styis well-plotted  tricate--wh some very funny bs-- the style is maturg  True  is a somewhat darker tale than the three previous books but that's only to Ms Rowlg's cred--anythg less would be an sult to her readers  All  all a wonderful read
When I started readg this book this mng I was  factpretty bed but after I got past the begg of the novel I couldnot stop readg  (truely I fished  the same day I got ) Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire was well wth readg  At a surprisg 734 pages the fourth Harry Potter book is a delicious book  I advise everyone to read  It was wth everry penny
I recieved the Harry Potter book at 9  the mng  didn't stop readg  until 11 at night It is spell bdg you get caught  the magical wld  you just can't escape This is the most complacated of all the books so i recomend  f older children
July 92000 Dear people Once you start readg this book you'll be glued to  This book is comic suspenseful  most of all FANTASTIC!  Harry Potter is a full on epic  unbelievably awesome sty Don't give this back to the book ste f NOTHING Do you hear me? NOTHING!  This  book gives children a wonderful motto I thk  says &quotDreams can  come true Even  you don't believe they can&quot And also remember  the real magic exists  your heart Hope you enjoy  treasure this book  ALWAYS!
And yet amazgly  does! JK Rowlg once aga proves that she is one of the most creative auths of the century weavg her magic to create a dark new chapter  the lives of Harry Potter  From an almost  simple tale  Book 1 about a po young boy who makes good Rowlg has  h her stride  Book 4 troducg us to a whole universe of Wizards   Wches some good some evil  a complex plot that contues to weave    around self wh so many details that readers h thier heads   frustration wh a &quothow could I not see that comg&quot sigh It is  nothg sht of Brilliant Thank you JK Rowlg f givg me 24 hours of  pure page-turng pleasure
I absolutley loved this book from the moment my eyes touched the page I liked  because Harry Potter is one of the most wonderful  well rounded  characters that one cannot help but be engrossed Harry  his 4th year  at Hogwarts is saddened that there will be no Quiddch this year but  delighted that a TriWizard Tournament will take 's place There is only  one problem only students over 17 can enter their names  the Goblet of  Fire which is the Goblet that a student enters his  her name To ensure  this rule Dumblede draws an age le around the Goblet But  somehowsome way Harrys name gets  sure enough his name is  called No one knew that this this simple friendly tournament could be  lked wh the Dark Ld that could lead to Voldemt full power  This book filled wh excement  hr will have you hooked from  begng to end
JKRowlg outdoes herself  this genious way of addg to the magical saga  I will refra from sayg any me about this book f fear of rug  f others  A must-read f all  Rowlg delivers an extremely  good tale  700  so pages
The fourth book of the Harry Potter series  is very good  I rated  five stars because of s outstg detail  very good plot  The Goblet of Fire really plays a small part  the sty I thk  should  have been called Harry Potter  the Triwizard Tournament  This book is  734 pages 37 chapters long  I would recommend this book to people the  like Sci-fi  Fantasy
This has to be the best book by far i really enjoyed readg  the climax was trully amazg i must say  was very good I recomend this book to any one that is 1-100 years old Harry Potter will go down   histy  is a true clasic
Tryg to review this whout givg away anythg is gog to be dficult so bear wh meThe Harry Potter books are growg up  Compared to this newest offerg the first three books were all sunny days  at the beach  All of a sudden we are thrown to the middle of a  tumultuous wld of wizards  We discover a WHOLE LOT me about the Harry  Potter backsty  we realize that not even Dumblede has the answer  f everythgThis book is the turng pot  the JK Rowlgs series  From the first chapter  gets very serious deed  As JK Rowlg  herself said this book is where the series turn serious  People will  start dygAll this said the same credible wld that existed  the  first 3 books is presented aga here although this time  is clouded  wh the shades of grey that we all start seeg between good  evil when  we start to grow up-Daniel B
Harry Potter is even me amazg than ever! He  his friends always have an awesome time!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is defely the best book I've ever read Once I started readg  I couldn't stop
I give "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" an "A++++++"  On a scale of one to ten I give  a 50  I couldn't put  down  I started the book at noon July 8th  fished  the next mng by 10:00 AM  Defely better than the other booksMgan age 10
I was of two mds about this book One I was afraid that  might not live up to my expectations (which after months of wag were fairly high) On the other h I was hopeful that  would be just as much fun  as the others Well thankfully  was the second! Wh ten mutes of  openg the book I was back  Harry Potter's le where you're just as  likely to get an earwax bean as a peach-flav where Floo powder rather  then cars are the nm  where magic is part of everyday le There  were the twists  turns we have come to expect from this auth  a  few -jokes  of course the hilary that keeps us readg I did a  marathon read after recievg  at 915 this mng  fished at 11  pm Like the end of Prisoner of Azkaban says  was as though I'd  swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer  one gulp It was that good  The  sty specically the end was me tense then anythg Harry has  experienced yet Parents especially might want to read the end wh their  younger children (8  under) I refuse to give away any spoilers sce  this book MUST be read first-h to get the full effect  Five stars  because sixteen million is not an option!
I must adm I was very exced to recieve  read this book But when I fally fished I knew somethg was dferent about  from the other books  that was that  had a sad gloomy depressed attude from the first page There were no real wisecracks from Fred  Gege Weasley no  comments from Ron etc Yes someone does die  I was pretty sad when I  found out who  was because I got to know him/her pretty well durg this  book One big dissapotment was no Quiddch except f the Quiddch  Wld Cup which hardly lasted I have a certa feelg that the books  56 7 might contue  this depressg manner which I thk could  very well ru the series Overall this was might least fave  the  series beg 734 pages of gloom But  you like those type of sties  you'll love this book
Fally s here! Harry's next adventure! This book like the others has many twist  turns  is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat The first chapter starts off wh You- Know- Who  Wmtail plottg their  next move There will be the Quiddch Wld Cup- an excg chapter not  to be missed  also changes will take place at Hogwarts As Ms Rowlg  promised someone that everyone likes will die which will change the lives  of the wches  wizards at Hogwarts Will You-Know-Who rise aga? Who  will die? And will Harry fall  love wh Hermione?  Get the book to fd  oout
This book is one of the best books Ive read  a long time Its by far the best harry potter book Its also much me suspenseful than the other ones  This book is impossible to put down once youve picked  up Isuggest   to anyone anywhere any time
I read all three Harry Potter books  I liked them all but this one is the best The only problem is that  is a book f children   has 734 pages Otherwise 's a great book
This is the best Harry Potter book yet!  It is full of suspense  surprises that you could never image  It gave me goosebumps made me cry  had me gaspg me than any other book i have ever read!  This is  a must read! If you haven't read the first three do so  only so you can  read this one!
When I read Harry Potter  was trash I cant believe that someone would waste their money on a book like this I've read the other Harry Potter Books  they were great but this one stks so bad Dont waste your  money
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a compellg sequel tothe other 3  is a masterpiece wh a longer sty than the othersgrowg the plot as  goes along  Truly classic  the last 3 are truly beg kept  everybody's mds  J K Rowlg has captured everyone's hearts
I got this book Saturday noon  I couldn't stop readg   (I fished  LATE Saturday eveng)  This is as good as all the other books  the detail surpasses even &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot  This book leaves you hangg to the end  As always wh Rowlg's books the big climax is   the last few chapters  Rowlg troduces some new characters such as  the Defense Agast the Arts teacher  others  I fd all of Rowlg's  books very humerous  this one didn't disappot me  The threads of  romance that she weaves throughout the book are not serious  they make  you laugh a great deal  In the Hogwarts' ball everybody goes out wh the  wrong people  Thank You J K Rowlg this book was great!
JK Rowlg said this was the pivotal book  the seven-book series She was right The first three books as great as they were as now nothg me than extended prologues to what is the begng of the real sty - Harry Potter startg to realize his purpose  his potentialA true  page-turner the 734 pages simply fly by  I was left wantg me -  now! The troduction of the Triwizard Tournament  the existence of the  other two wizardg  wchcraft schools set the stage f what will  certaly become a broader stroke wh which the fces of Ld Voldemt  will eventually be faced ( from which they will ga addional power?)The one disappotment wh this book  frankly wh the series so  far is that  lacks character development  the darker characters -  Draco Malfoy  his ilk However given events  the fal chapter those  characters may take me substantive roles  the comg booksThe death  of one character was quick  stunng yet will undoubtedly serve as a  foundation f thgs to come The last few chapters actually had me choked  up - rare f a book The emotions that come pourg out of everybody at  the end is a notable release f a series that to that pot was nearly  emotionlessA great read good fun thoughtful trospective  most  of all leavg the reader longg f me I thought I would be anxious  f the next Star Wars movie  Matrix 2 Nonsense The only future date I  care about is Harry Potter book five
Usg the wonder that is Amazon I managed to receive the new Harry Potter early yesterday  usg my Special Readg Techniques(TM) I managed to read the whole thg  around ten hours As  is the size of a small  brick  wasn't easy The rumours say that Harry falls  love   someone dies And Rowlg seems to know that everybody knows this cruelly  makg several people look like the cidates f thisHarry goes to the  Quiddch Wld Cup  thgs go a ltle wrong there Meanwhile Hermione  tries to claim equal rights f house elves several characters from  previous books reappear  Voldemt well that would be tellg But  read  unless you can sleep at night not knowg how Hermione deals wh  pesky tabloid repters
This is certaly one the best books I've ever readContug upon the last book Harry Potter gets  me trouble  he meets up wh his dreaded enemy I can't wa until the next book comes out I'm certatly  gettg 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is just as good  better just as terestg  suspendg as all the other Harry Potterbooks  JK  Rowlg keeps Harry Potter as an terestg  unpredictable character you can never guess what's gog to happen next  JK Rowlg is a great auth  should be recognized as one of the best auths of all time  Her books have been recognized as &quotGreat&quot  &quotThe best series I've ever read&quot by everyone I know
As eagerly as I waed to read the new book there was a partof me that was dreadg   What   was too long to keep myattention?  What   was not as good as the others?  As I started to read the book all of my fears were assuaged  I could not put the book down  fished this bulky masterpiece  two days  And this book is even better than the other three  It is legimately scary  parts  wonderful  others  It's full of surprises  likeable characters  It strays from the fmula that the other three held by  this time delivers a new  wonderful experience  These books keep gettg better  better  now I can't believe I have to wa a year f Book 5
the rule is nearly always that the sequel(s) are bound to be wse than the igals  however jk rowlg has broken the rule  thank god!  every harry potter book has been better than the last  this is no exception  do NOT let the size daunt you!  i bought the book at eight this  mng sat down to read  didn't stop til i fished  at two this  afternoon  apparently i had an entire conversation wh my parents durg  this time (so they say) but i don't remember i was too engrossed  the  bookthe plot just gets deeper  deeper  you can't put the book down  because you want to you need to know what happens next  the characters  are also even me developed than  the first three books  rowlg  does an exceptionally good job of conveyg how they're all growg up   while  doesn't end wh a clf hanger (  did half the wld  would die  anticipation) rowlg artfully sps the plot so as to make  way f the three books than will eventually follow  absolutely amazg  i can't remember readg a book  years that has held me so spell bound  buy this book you will NOT regret 
When I first read the Scerer's Stone back  August 1998 I had no idea what was  ste f the entire wld But I do now These books are easily wh no doubt the best books I have ever read They are so action  packed humous  yet they have somethg somethg hard to detect I  thought that the third book was the best but now i thk the Goblet of  Fire is defately number one They just keep gettg better  better   I cant wa until the Fth one comes out
The magic contues  JK Rowlgs wonderful series I fished the book  two evengs (despe 's length)  I contue to be enchanted wh the series Rowlg has done a wonderful job contug the tradions of  whimsy  terr she has established  previous books  I'm already  lookg fward to her next book Fans of Harry Potter should purchase this  immediately you won't be dissapoted
Yes 's over 700 pagesbut I still fished   one night You won't fd yourself countg pages left I promiseYes 's up to par Rowlg contues wh some threads she'd started  earlier books (we do  get to see me of Sirius Black)  starts some terestg new ones (I'm  especially curious about Hermione  the house-elf liberation front)If  there's anyone left who hasn't read the earlier books 's best to start  at the begng  wk your way through but Goblet of Fire does have  plenty of remders  explanations of what happened  the earlier books   case you've fgotten anythg  Goblet of Fire is a ltle darker than  the earlier books (the death Rowlg warned us of is not who you thought   would be) but I still found myself laughg out loud  several spots   You won't be disappoted
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire should the best children's book of all time!  It is awesome  Readers beware you'll be readg f a long time!
This was the best yet! Even though  was over 700 pages  ended too soon I can't believe I have to wa so long f the next book I don't want to say too much about the contents because I wouldn't want to spoil  anythg but I will say hts of romance  death come  the most  unexpected places to the most unexpected peopleIt is filled wh all  of the elements we've come to love  expect  the first three books  Advebture suspense  a big dash of JK Rowlg's wonderful  imaignation!Anyone that likes Harry Potter will love this book If you  haven't read HP yet what are you wag f? But start wh Harry Potter   the Scerer's Stone  read them  the der they were wrtenBy  the way I'm the mother I got hold of  befe my twelve year old  daughter who's readg  now
I thk was very very very excg! You couldn't predict what would happen next! Harry has a girlfriend!  Someone dies!  I found the new Harry Potter especially terestg because  doesn't start wh Harry My only  complat  that the next one can't come soon enough!
I love all Harry Potter books  i read them all the time over  over aga i was  a spell!  I spent all my money f the new book but  was wth !  Its a great book  has twists  turns like you cant  emage!
I am an English Education undergrad  have just started my jouney to the wonderful wk of JK Rowlg I found her new sty to be extremely rich wh language  dense plot two maj gredients  any great  sty Furtherme I love the impact this series has on the younger/new  generation of lerature Maybe we'll be able to fally get away from the  MTV generation after all
I fished this book  just a day! 's credible!  I can hardly wa f the next one! I recommend Harry Potter to all muggles: young  old!  :)
 you like harry potter this is the best book yet Please read  I love when harry fell  love f the first time
I throughly enjoyed the book  I could not put  down There are many excg action filled moments  new mysteries to figure out  Those makg  dferent  me excg than the first three  the series  Defatly a book you need to read
This was a great book! I loved all the action  magical mayhem that took place! So far this was Rowlg's best HP book wh HP two comg  second The characters plot  settgs wked so well together that   was hard to put the book down! I cannot wa f HP book five to come out  probably next year I found this book to  be darker dealg wh much me  tense issues then the other three HP booksRowlg did warn that   would be this way but I was a ltle surprised at the endg It seemed  hric: blood-lettg decapation the risg of a dead body but as an  older reader I could underst these elements  how they f to the  plot however I would caution parents of young  younger children I  don't recommend this book f any child under the age of twelve! Please  read the endg of HP four befe allowg your kids to! Some might get  really scared  not underst what is gog on! But all  all a  fantastic  book
Great Book The tradion contues Go Harry can't wa f the next book Good Sty!
We got the book this mng at 12:01  just fished !Nearly all your fave characters return  THAT is part of theproblem -- this is one long book! 734 pages!  Rowlg throws  a lot of back sty to keep new readers up to pace but really    who hasn't read the other three books? All the background might get a ltle bg f Harry's adult fans  will almost certaly do so f the kids  the readg group! Rowlg should have a ltle me fah  her readers to discern the backsty f themselves rather than rehashg  book after book How long will book seven be? Eesh!JK Rowlg's &quotEmpire Strikes Back&quot Goblet of Fire is a dark chapter  the Harry Potter saga settg us up f what will undoubtedly be an excg  harrowg rally by the fces of good to overcome Voldem    (He who cannot be named! )Learn me about Hagrid's family!

Harry  friends contend wh hmones  trigue  this fourth book  the seriesStudents from *other* Wizardry Schools appear (I thk I was as surprised as Harry was by the idea of schools other than Hogwart's)   Ms Rowlg kdly cludes a scene  which Hermione spends a ltle  time tryg to teach a feign student how to pronounce her name crectly  - 's Her-MY-oh-nee  (I can't be the only one who's been mis-pronouncg  !)

I have been anxiously awag this 4th Harry Potter book   does not disappot  This book is a great addion to the series  does a lot f furtherg the series' mythology however a good ed could have removed at least 200 pages whout harmg the content of the sty
This book is just a sign to show us all that our culture  children are readg trash where they should be readg much other material Its a shame that even 15+ teenagers are callg this 'The best series of books  ever' Give me Tolkien  Dante any day please
Another great stallment of the Harry Potter series  I felt that the pre-publication hype prepared us f the death of someone far me central to the series  frankly I felt a me than a ltle manipulated on that  pot  But overall the book delivers  The plot elements that make this  series so wonderful were all  evidence--great characters the reader  really cares about imagative suations a suspenseful endg  me  clues to the mystery of Potter's past  What's the publication date f  book 5?  I can't wa!
I had recently reread the first 3 Harry books  my maj concern was that the 4th wouldn't hold up to the first 3 but I was defely proven wrong It was actually better The plot is well thought out no last mute  &quot throw s&quot to keep us happy Harry Potter is growg up  he  is defely changg but he has the same spir as ever Despe the ever  contug crease  length of the books I was as drawn to the Hogwarts   Quiddch wld as ever befe  hungry f me when  ended The  book is described as pivotal  so  is wh me depth beg given to  Harry's  the people around him's past But the bottom le is that 's  a great sty  JK Rowlg has managed to wre a better book than  befe rather than start to water down the plot ( I adm I was wried )  Hoay f Harry!
Absolutely fascatg book so wonderful that I'm sure they haven't prted enough copies  Very excg wh lots of action  puzzles to solve  Unfgiveable cantations that will put you to Azkaban f le   used wonderg who is after Harry this time  Unftunately Harry is  gettg a ltle terested  girls which is bg
I've just spent the day readg Harry Potter  the Goblet ofFire--now how long til Book 5?  Harry seems to be growg up  Ithought all the ma characters were much me terestg  complicated  this book than they have been  I suppose there's que a lot of dference between 11  14  Harry Ron  Hermione are still entirely likeable  there are some imptant changes  their relationships brewg  Many new characters are troduced here as well  obviously many of them will be recurrg characters  Harry's last years at Hogwarts  I was particularly terested  what happened wh Snape!The book is tightly plotted  very tense I wouldn't recommend  f young readers-- you thought the dements were scary wa until the end of this book!  But 's defely up to the hype  will have readers wag f the next stallment
JK Rowlg has done  aga wh the fourth book  the Harry Potter series The Goblet of Fire  However readers should beware This volume has a far darker aura than any of the other books so far  In fact 's  probably not appropriate f many younger childrenThe fbodg element  begs  the first chapter wh the first death  Voldemts scheme to  reste his health  kill Harry Potter  this feelg contues through  the rest of the bookThe plot revolves around the &quotTriwizard  Tournament&quot which hasn't been held f years due to the deaths of the  contestants  Three rival schools (cludg Hogwarts) will have one person  from each school chosen by &quotthe Goblet of Fire&quot compete f the  w  However the contestants have to be 17  The three contestants are  selected  then to everyone's surprise Harry Potter's name comes out of  the goblet  is to compete  the tournament as a fourth contestant  From there the plot becomes me  me volved  eventually  volves the death of a semi-recurrg characterThe book was an  excellent read  will defatly appeal to the me mature reader  But  the subject matter is such that  would be best f parents to make the  decision on whether 's appropriate f their child to read
This book was great I got   fished the same day It is the best  the four part seris so far I can't wa f the next  It will keep you rived until the end
Yet aga JK Rowlg has wrten a clever entertag book!  I'm glad to see that under what must've been enmous pressure  anticipation to produce this fourth book the auth has not failed  The book shows no  evidence of beg rushed n does  leave out the good character  development I've come to expect from the first three books  Rather  is  as enjoyable as any of the other books  not me  It is full of  surprises w suspense mystery  a long list of other tras that  make  a readg experience that is excg  wonderfulI couldn't  put this book down (which is a rather over-used phrase but  gets to the  pot)!  I won't give anythg away because that would be unfair but I can  say that this book is an excellently wrten fantastic masterpiece that  will keep the whole wld cravg f me!  (If however you cannot wa  f another book whout extreme sufferg I would defely suggest  readg books by such auths as Diana Wynne Jones Sherwood Smh Susan  Cooper  Patricia C Wrede who are all terric fantasy auths)

I got this book  I read  nonstop untill I feshed  It was so good! I read untill 4  the mng the next day!  This is a must read
   I don't give  five stars 's mostly f that reasonMy Amazon copy arrived at 1:30 pm  I fsihed readg at 1 am havg fgotten to stop f dner until I had been readg f eight hours  straight If the previous books hypnotized you as they did me be sure you  have nothg on your schedule at the pot you pick this one up!And yet  of course 's not as good as the hype but how could  be? The character  who gets killed isn't que as signicant as many had thought All the  previous Potters had plotholes but this one's holes were maj enough that  I noticed them *befe* I fished readg That beg the case so  what? If you're gog to be subjected to the kd of crazed hype that  Potter is attractg at least let  be f books as well-wrten as  these
This book has been the best that I have read  my entire beg  Everythg grows me  me omous  this book as 's settg the stage f a Voldemt me powerful  future books  JK Rowlg overdid  herself  I still feel as  I am  her magical wld simply stunng!  I encourage everyone to read this
I vaguely thought that JK Rowlg might be able to produce another Harry book of such fe calibre as &quotThe Philosophers(Scerers) Stone&quot &quotThe Chamber of Secrets&quot  &quotThe Prisoner of Azkaban&quot but of course I was wrong  JK Rowlg hasn't produced the  same qualy book - this time she has surpassed herself  This was my  reaction as I walked through my shoppg center wh &quotThe Goblet of  Fire&quot  my hs  my stunned reaction as the first chapter  brought excement  fear  It took me 5  a 1/2 hours to fish book  four (my mum warned me that I would get digestion  I read  too fast)   every moment of  made me wish that I were closer to the end not  because I wanted  to be over but because I wanted to see how Harry would  cope wh the new battles that JKR was settg out f him  To be que  honest I cried f half an hour when I had fished   It touched me so  greatly that I am not sure that I will be able to fish readg  to my  ltle brother when we get there  So beware all you mums  dads you'll  need to have a good old fashioned cry wh  your kids when you've fished  this one  f the teenagers out there you like me will want a hug  from your mum  dad Trust me:  Harry will live fever  what has to be  the best book yet
J K Rowlg has created a suspensful  well crafted middle book  her Harry Potter series  The book is 734 pages long f a reason  There is me action than ever befe  this stallment we see the maturg  personalies of Harry Hermione  Ron  we ga excg new sights  to the mysterious pasts of Profess Dumblede Profess Snape   He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
Harry  his friends are defely growg up yet this fourth  a series contues Harry's saga seamlessly New characters from two other schools f wizards are troduced  the Triwizard Tournament succeeds  the Quiddch Wld Cup as the centerpiece of suspense  excement  Rowlgs series is a delight f young  old alike Hope we don't have to  wa as long f number five!
Well this is what everyone has been wantg to know - was  wth all the hype? Well I have been askg around all the people I know ('s only a day sce  came out but we've all fished  already)  the answer  I've been given is a resoundg YES!  I thought the plot was as JK  Rowlg warned us &quotdarker&quot than the first three books but   did have some funny moments as well which nicely balanced out the book   left us  even me suspense  As wh the first three books  Rowlg gave hts all the way through as to the endg - but never que  enough f us to wk out what that endg could be  she once aga  brought the suspense slowly to a climax leavg me lerally unable to put  the book down I thought nothg could be better than the third HP book  but she has proved me wrong  I won't give the endg away but  is  me of a clfhanger than the other books  already one day after book  four came out I am eagerly awag book five In conclusion I thk that   was defately wth all the hype - this was the best book  the wld  but how could she leave  like that?
JK Rowlg has once aga cast a spell over her latest book She is a master at pullg all of her details together I enjoyed this as immensely as the first three  not me I was captivated by the tense moments   the triwizard tournament  the scenes wh ld Voldemt She also  brgs  some new characters that give the book some great twists I LOVED  IT!
You will never read somethg so dazzlg beautul richly told  It was edge-of-your seat excement all the way through!
I found that the wty dialogue  the wonderful settg enchantg  I received by book from Amazoncom yesterday  could not put  down  This book will soon go out to my oldest nephew back east (he swear's he's Harry  carnate)!  This is an excellent read f anyone who wishes to live the  magnicent adventures that we used to cook up as children  And f the  kids wow they are truly gog to love this book  Congratulations to Ms  Rowlg she's done  aga!
I thought this book  this first place was que long nut I'm not biasg my review on that  The begng of Harry Potter 4 started off que dry  my opnon  also had almost nothg to do wh Harry  The first  pieces really eher could have been skipped  the reader would not have  known   could have been shter  a ltle me excg  Hearg a  guy speak f like two chapters about himself  plans is not exactly  excg  the Harry way  Goblet of Fire then starts to focus on Harry a  b me  When the trio gets back to Hogwarts (fally)  seems like  right off the bat that Ron  Harry aren't friends anyme  everythg  crumbles  Hermoe  Harry become me of friends but  wasn't like how  most of the Harry readers like Ron's friendship wh Harry was much me  humous  plus you got a third sight to everythg  When you  fally get to the end of the book everythg starts fallg apart  Evil  rises but when the book closes almost none of the answer were solved   the endg really left you wag f me: a lot me!
Fally s here! Harry's next adventure! This book like the others has many twist  turns  is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat The first chapter starts off wh You- Know- Who  Wmtail plottg their  next move There will be the Quiddch Wld Cup- an excg chapter that  will have you cheerg f your favoure team Changes will take place at  Hogwarts that may affect everyone! And as Ms Rowlg promised someone  that everyone likes will die which will change the lives of the wches   wizards at Hogwarts Will You-Know-Who rise aga? Who will die? And  will Harry  Ron fall  love wh Hermione?  Get the book to fd out
I thought the book was really good except that part of  was st of sad  scary  I liked that  was a lot bigger because I could spend a lot me time wh   (Even though I fished   one day)  I don't want to say much me because I don't want to give away what happens
I got the book from Amazon at around 2:00 PM  fished at 1:18 am that next mng my first thoughts after readg the book (other than sleepess) were &quotI LOVED IT!&quot  &quotOMG OMG OMG!&quot  repeated several times  my head  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  most certaly the best book of the series  is a b of a clf-hanger  as well  The suspense betrayal danger death  even a b of love all  put together made this book the best I have read  a long time  In this  book we see a return of the fact that Harry  Voldemt's ws are from  the same pheonix  we fd out the pheonix's name  Sirus Black   Crookshanks make a return as well as Wmtail  I recommend this book to  all who have not bought  yet as  is truly a classic  Kudos to J K  Rowlg on her superb wkhurry up on the next book please!
I just fished the fourth Harry Potter book  I really liked  The begng has an terestg twist that someone who's read Harry Potter  the Chamber of Secrets might notice The neat thg is  puts  pieces  from the other books that are fun to figure out like I AM LORD VOLDEMORT   the name  comes from The whole book was great not bg like you  would image a 734 page book beg but the endg really had my heart  beatg FAST It was terryg! I kept tryg to convce myself that   was only Harry's dream
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a book that will succeed regardless of s qualy Hence wrg a review f  is fundementally a futile task And that is OK This is fundamentally a nice solid engagg   very cute adventure  mystery sty sat  a very pleasant millieu It  manages the restrictions of a semi-mystery que well  ends  a  unexpected but very reasonable way There is nothg hribly wrong wh  this book The characters are wh few exceptions que endearg  the  wrg style is que entertag When  comes down to  I que  liked the book  Not that  lacked faults In my humble opion cute  ltle entertag books like this should be fairly sht unlike this 750  page tome And so many of these pages could easily be shed There is a  fairly long subplot about an anti-slavery campaign which is almost  completely superfluous  is only resolved  a very uncomftable way  (they LIKE to be slaves) Take out this  a love terest done wh a  very heavy h  you are down to a reasonably sized 500 page book  And  I get the feelg that this book would not wk well whout readg the  first three novels  the series There are plenty of unexpected references  to thgs magical which are explaed  previous volumes However those  who have read the previous books might struggle wh how fmulaic they  really are The plot le &quotSomeone is tryg to kill Harry who is  ?&quot Is gettg a b tiresome  while characters from previous  novels do reta their charm newer addions seem dry  leless It is  possible that this book wrgs the last le out of Harry Potter but  personally I prefer to thk the igaly present  the first will  reappear  the next sequel
As an adult I thought  was a great read but 's so much darker than the first three especially the resurrection of the (mostly dead) evil villian Wh killgs cuttg off of body parts  the drawg of blood   deserves a PG ratg This stuff is not f ltle kids But then aga   you can actually read a 700 page book you're not really a ltle kid are  you?
The first three Harry Potter books shocked astounded  touched me The unique Brish style has delighted me throughout this trio of novelsThe fourth is  a whole new ballparkWhen somethg is flawless where do you beg? When there are numerable impeccable qualies to describe where do you start? Those are the queries I face as I beg wrg this reviewRowlg's wrg style is whimsical yet contre It is comprehensible by children  the third grade  higher but enjoyable by adults of all walks of leThis book like the others  the series is able to depict the humans humously dubbed "Muggles" as well as the wizards wh impeccable hum  emotion Truly delightful The 700+ pages may seem dauntg at first but befe you realize  you're done wh this wonderful book all too soonSometimes people face decisions  le These decisions can be febodg dficult  timidatg This is not one such decision Don't hesate to click the "Add to Shoppg Cart" button at the top of this page Not only is the book good--the [] price is too (trust me--I've shopped around)Get this bookYou won't regret this book
The wa is fally over I fally bought &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot   read the book wh hours  It starts off wh Harry gog to watch the Quiddch Wld Cup game wh the Weasleys   meetg some imptant folks that show up  this 734 page book  Harry  then returns to Hogwarts  fds out that there will be a new  competion held at the school called the Triwizard Tournament As usual  there is the dark loomg of Ld Voldemt that hangs over everyone   Harry's circle his friends Sirius  adults cluded Yes true the  rums of teenage love  a beloved character's death are true  However  this book contually has funny scenes  touchg moments that can keep  any child entertaed  The sty ends on a very suspenseful note  I won't  ru  f anyone who hasn't yet read the book but now I can't wa until  book 5 comes out so the sty will contue  This is defely a book  that you would want to read over  over aga just as the other books   the series were
This book is the best of the 4 so far Wh s 700+ pages  doesn't look easy to read I am a Harry Potter fan  I love all of the books This book has a twist endg that you won't want to miss! And Amazoncom has a  really good price! Order  today!
You know about Harry Potter HP # 4 is awesome Me twists magic than the 2nd  3rd books combed! I loved this book fromstart to fish I'm wag f #5!
This is by far the best potter book yet!  It was a real page turner! I Read   less than 6 hours yesterday (the release date) out of all the books  reads the most like an adult piece of wrg There is only one problem  that is that  is over much too quickly even though  is the  longest book!
The book rules! I couldn't put  down once I started ! When I first saw  I thought  would be too long but every one of the 734 pages were wonderful! A must-read!
The 4th stallment of Harry Potter books is absolutely adventurous grippg  fun  I dont know why the age f readers of these books are set from 9-12 years old  Everyone can read these books  I can't wa to  read the 5th one  This is a must read f all ages!
This fourth stallment vastly exceeds expectations keepg readers guessg until the end!  Rowlg never loses a thread  this tapestry  weaves them- dare we say- magically together f a brilliant endHowever as anticipated this volume is much darker s  predecesss  I am not entirely sure of s suabily f small  children  At risk of spoilg any surprises (which are well wth wag  f) let me just say the book does not end wh the same &quotgood  triumphs over evil&quot euphia as the previous Harry Potter booksThe  begng of the boy/girl fact is brilliantly done-  you will be  surprised at where romance blossomsIf you are expendg energy tryg  to guess who dies- stop- you are wastg your time  When readg the book  gives no hts until  actually  sadly happensF such a long  book  is a very quick read  I found myself readg faster  faster  desperate to fd out what happened next!  I hope you all enjoy  as much  as I did  The only part I hated was fishg   realizg how long   will be until number five
JK Rowlg is a wrg genius  This has to be one of the greatest books ever published  Her talents as a wrer are astronimical  It was well wth the wa to be able to read this gret book  She has a keen sense of hum  adventure  It is a must have f kids of all ages
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a fantastic page turner -- I lerally couldn't put  down  It's size may be dauntg to younger readers but f those who love a good sty packed wh adventure mystery   magic 's wth The book has a darker feel than the other three  Potter books sce Ld Voldemt's power begs to build  his evil  fluence is spreadg  He is not above murder dece  dark magic  There are plenty of new characters  this one  you're never sure who  is friend  foe right up until the end  Meanwhile Harry has plenty of his  own problem to solve everythg from impossible tasks to gettg a date  f the Christmas Dance  The plot is too good to give away so I won't  spoil If you're a fan of Harry Potter this is a &quotmust  have&quot  My only problem now is havg to wa until book 5 comes out  particularly sce the last chapter  &quotGoblet of Fire&quot is tled  &quotThe Begng&quot  Harry come back soon!
This is possibly the most tense fantasy read I've ever experienced  Thanks to the fact that I'm a b walkg-impaired at the moment I had a three-hour block  which to read the book  needed another half hour to recover  Not a page is wasted  this sty--every sgle wd means  somethgThe plot is darker than any previous book  It starts out as  always wh Harry stayg wh the Dursleys over summer break until he  receives an vation from his best friend Ron to go to the Quiddch  Wld Cup  However  seems that there's followers of Ld Voldemt  afoot--called Death Eaters-- they've decided to mess thgs up me  than a b  The sty begs to become me  me convulted as  goes  along so I simply suggest that you read the bookMy own personal  comments?~There is *defely* somethg between Ron  Hermione  ( the way to pronounce her name properly is  this book! 's at the  very top of page 419) although Hermione fds herself a boyfriend that  isn't Ron  It's an terestg subplot :)~Yes a character dies--  the scene where  happens reduced me to tears  I had to put the book  down f a few moments  But 's done really well~The new  teacher--Mad-Eye Moody--is a great fascatg character  as always  there's a huge backplot gog on volvg the Defense Agast the Dark  Arts teacher that I only caught a glimpse of as I read the book but made  perfect sense when I came to the end~Ra Skeeter is possibly the most  annoyg character ever created the most backbg  She's like all  the supermarket tabloids rolled up  a bright maroon wches'  robe~Dumblede has maj guts  Wow  That's all I'm saygIn  conclusion?This book is a well-thought out well-executed all around  captivatg piece of fantasy lerature  It's defely not f any kids  under ne (too dark  tense  creepy!  let them read the first three  over  over  when they get older give them the fourth to read) but  everyone else will alternatively have a blast  have shivers over this  bookAw fget me just go out  read !over  over  when they get older give them the fourth to read) but  everyone else will alternatively have a blast  have shivers over this  bookAw fget me just go out  read !
My vision is blurred from stayg up all night readg but Goblet of Fire does not disappot!  I was so wried I would have to reread all the other books to brg myself up to date but Rowlg does a superb job of  remdg you ever so gently of past crucial episodes  the characters  lives  And speakg of characters!  There are several new complex   very compellg wizards on the hizons both good  evil  Harry Ron   Hermione are growg up  terms of their romantic terests but thank  goodness not too fast - there's no tense mushess to be found  all  700+ pages  The whole book centers around an terschool (wizard school  that is) competion   gives a fabulous edge of tension to the entire  volume  You are CRAZY  you don't read this book as soon as possible -  you will not be disappoted
Although this book is long  will keep your terest all the way wh Ld Voldem oops &quothe who should not be name&quot  his sidekick tryg to get rid of Harry once  f all  Everyone one should read this  book from adults to children
I just got my copy deleivered yesterday mng by FedEx  fished readg  that night  You won't be able to put  down! As usual JK Rowlg draws you to the wld of Harry Potter  the most disappotg  part is fishg the last page I wish book 5 was out already One bonus:  we learn how to pronounce Hermione
I loved this book I really did despe the excessive number bad guys plottg disaster but there wasn't enough quiddch   to su me If  is truly the wizardg wld's fave spt  everyone is  fanatically devoted to  why don't they make the time f friendly  skirmishes between friends?  This seems odd to me The spts fans I know   love don't content themselves just watchg other people play the game   wag f someone else to play 'the big game' they get a ltle  spts action of their own gog on their own time Come to thk of   why don't Hogwarts' students have any st of physical education course  requirement?  (They certaly seem to study everythg else under the sun!)
Thkg that Harry Potter couldn't possibly get any better than the previous three books I started readg  fished &quotGoblet of Fire&quot seven hours later beyond satisfied  dyg to get my hs on  the next stallment (Beware: clf-hanger endg)  This is easily the  best book I've read all summer  Not to be missed even  you lost your  childhood years ago  Here's your chance to fd  agaF returng  Harry Potter fans not only is the plot as engagg as ever Rowlg also  manages to develop Harry's personaly further whout losg her deft  touch  combg previous action wh new adventures  F new readers  the seamless clusion of Harry's previous adventures makes  easy to  underst the plot&quotGoblet of Fire&quot is me similar to  &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot than the first two books  far me  ambious  Not only is  a much longer read (not that I md!) Rowlg  also further blurs the le between the muggle  wizardg wld  especially wh the troduction of the Quiddch Cup  Old characters pop  up  ex the novel wh me depth than when they entered the narrative  quietly exhibg their abily to hold their own agast Harry's  flamboyant presence  From Ron  Hermione to Sirius   He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named prepare to meet these characters who have grown  sce the previous books  And just when I thought I'd hate Snape  feverIf you haven't already gotten this book GO OUT AND BUY IT!  And  you already own  I hope your adventure is as much fun as me!
OK  This book IS big  But don't let s size fool you!  It starts off wh a bang (somebody gets murdered!  Honest!) bogs down just a ltle b  f a while  then  THEN but that would be tellg!

Wow! I don't know what other wd to use to describe Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Harry returns to Hogwarts f his fourth year  a book that grabs you  the first chapter  keeps you until the end The  Quiddch Wld Cup Voldemt Sirius Black Death Eaters the Triwizard  Tournament - all part of what will certaly become the essential volume   the Potter series Aside from several new characters (Profess Moody! )  we also meet a few we have until now only heard about (notably Bill   Charlie Weasly) The tension-filled endg where les are drawn   characters choose their side  the battle of good (Dumblede)  evil  (Voldemt) will have many people jog me  cheerg Ms Rowlg f  another superb thrill-ride of a book  beggg her to hurry wh volume  five!
I have to say that this is by far the best book  the series  The plot twists  turns like a maze throughout the Tournament  Hogwarts grounds  Many old friends are brought back  many people are examed  explaed  a new light  I won't give too much away f those who  have not read  but nothg is as  seems  this book  As the  characters are fced to exame each other we ourselves are fced to do  the same  The battle of good  evil is fought aga perhaps me direly  than befe  The endg surprised me  I closed the book wh many  questions left from previous books answered  many me new questions to  take their place  The book made me laugh  really made me cry    certaly left me wag f me  I hope you enjoy   I know I will  be eagerly awag book 5
Another great stallment  the Harry Potter series This book tells the tale of Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts wh the same engrossg language  charm of the previous three I would highly recommend this book to all lover's of the Harry Potter series While  is a lengthy 700+ pages  is  a very enjoyable read
All I can say is WOW! This book is better than the last three put together! Harry has que a frighteng experience when he dreams of Ld Voldermt  Wmtail murderg a man  wakes up wh a bldg pa   his scar on his feheadHis summer gets me complicated when he  goes to the Quiddch Wld cup  somethg very unexpected  Erie  happens And when he gets to Hogwts he's hried to fd out that  there's NO QUIDDITCH but stead somethg just as excg Who knows what  will happen to Harry  this book Wh a new Defense agast the Dark  teacher  a nosy repter  Padfoot on the sideles Harry defiantly has  his hs full this year!

don't get me wrongi love the harry pottter series but the fourth book is the exceptionthe sty  plot are great but while readg the book i found parts of  that i already read beg put later back  the book  stead of the crect chaptersi give this book -5 stars
All the hype all the wag all the speculation - all wthwhile!  The new Harry Potter novel is terric!  The Goblet of Fire seems to be a pivotal novel  the direction that the series will take  the future  This series has grown  developed over the four books but the essential  message of friendship  teamwk remas  this newest book  Harry is  aga a reluctant hero one that kids  grownups can relate to  cheer  f  I read   one big gulp 's impossible put down  The Goblet of  Fire sets the reader up nicely f the next stallment (oh no! I have to  WAIT f the next one!)  Rowlg is wrg some of the most addictive   excg fiction f kids  adults of any current auth  I hope she  keeps  up f long long time
I thought was very Very VERY excg! Harry has a girlfriend!  Someone dies!  He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back!  I thought this Harry Potter was especially terestg  the way  doesn't start wh Harry  sted Voldemt My only complat is that the next one won't come soon  enough!
Harry Potter is back! Wh me adventure! He befriends students from other schools alas the wld cup is great  amusg but a ltle bg All the same  is great! Rowlg produces a high stard of english on  the Potter saga!

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is me than twice as long as the other books which gives us twice as much readg pleasure  There is a lot gog on  this book what wh the Quiddch Wld Cup the Triwizard  Tournament year 4 at Hogwarts  the plottg of Ld Voldemt  As  usual even the most seemgly m of characters is imptant to the plot   s resolutionAs a parent I will warn that this book particularly  the latter 20%  so is much darker  me deadly than the pri books  If read to smaller children there will be serious matters to be discussed  It may not be appropriate f sensive younger children who are not able  to easily separate fantasy  realyThat said  is a wonderful book  which entertas mightily  While very long this book leaves many matters  unresolved f the remag books  I already am eager f the next one!
I found this to be a wonderful transional book  The dos are now open wh lots of tricate plot threads hangg f future novels  There is no denyg that this is an tense book that deals wh dficult issues  I  believe the young readers will be better f the exposure  the skillful  hlg of these issues<BR>This book has wide appealeven to 32 year  old Muggles
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a book that had a lot tolive up to And  did exceedg many expectations JK Rowlgoutdid herself this time not only makg the book extra long but packg  wh danger action suspense  thgs that are sure to surprise you There are many terestg twists to the plot along wh some side-plots that add a b of hum Thgs that are sure to give you a smile are found all through this book along wh thgs to make a chill run down your spe Elements from the first three books tie  wh the fourth  along wh ltle touches really gives scope to Harry's wld  makes a person thk  is real Book four will make you want to read  right through from the begng to end whout puttg  down And no matter how long  is when you fish you just want to keep readg me When the book does end there's a thous questions you'll want to know  number one is 'When does book five come out?' somethg that every Harry Potter fan will be countg the days to There is so much to say about this book but not enough space Anyone who wants a good excg sty to read buy this book You won't regret 
I got the book at midnight on July 8th  fished readg  by midnight on the 9th I couldn't put  down Book 4 is the best one yet  Not only are you able to read about the same familiar characters that we all love so much Rowlg manages to troduce several new characters who you will fd  just as unfgettable such as the new Defense Agast Dark Arts teacher  You also fd me background  about characters such as Snape  Hagrid  she also gives me details about the time right after Voldemt lost power   what happened to his followers Harry  the gang are growg up   start to deal wh issues like boy/girl relations Herimone even gets a  boyfriend  someone is a ltle jealous And yes- a recurrg character  does die which is a sad part  the book It is still full of hum like  when the Weasleys go to the Dursleys  Gege  Fred get hold of  Dudley  You also fd out that there are other schools like Hogwarts The  end is fantastic but she leaves many issues unresolved that will leave you  clamg f book 5 I am a 30 year old wh no children  would  encourage any adult to jo  the fun  read this  any of the Harry  Potter books
I am exasperatgly amazed!  By far this is the most excg of the Harry Potter books  The books starts wh a wonderfully entertag Quiddch Wld Cup match complete wh enchantg cheerleaders who  mesmerize you to pullg f the other team  Then a near disaster wh  the Dursley's as Dudley fally gets his come-uppance  Speakg of  come-uppance Malfoy is fally put  his place when he is turned to a  -- well you'll have to read to fd out  Wh dragons merpeople a giant  squid dements  Blast Ended Skrewts this book is defely wth  your time  READ IT NOW!   Beware though of the poison penned Ra  a  very violent endg when Harry is face to face wh You-Know-Who  The  twists  turns  this book will keep you up at nightmaybe several  nights  Read wh caution you never know who may be lurkg   those  you see are their true selves  Danger lurksbe preparedCONSTANT  VIGILANCE!
Rowlg has topped herself I'm very impressed  lookg fward wh great anticipation to book Five  The Goblet of fire contues Harry's quest to become a full fledged wizard In this the pivotal fourth book  Rowlg succesfully ups the anti f Harry-- ld Voldmt  every one  else--as we are troduced to a wider globe of magical creatures   peoples  places as two histicaly ternational events (The Quiddch  Wld Cup  the Trernatonail Wizard tournament) open both harry's   the readers hizens As usual Rowlg's great gt of character keeps the  plot sparklg as we never know until the end exactly who is who  the  battle f good vs evil  we are troduced to a spell that blurs the  les of responsibly  culpably even further Highly recomend I  stayed up until five  the mng to fish my only regret is that I now  have a LONG WAIT f book five
I thk that I speak f everyone out there when I say how exced I was to fally get my hs on this book!  I just fished readg all 734 pages  JK Rowlg has truly outdone herself wh Harry Potter  the  Goblet of Fire  Year four is a very dferent one f all the Hogwarts  students- There will be no school quiddch(gasp!)  Voldemt  his  followers contually ga power throughout the year there is a  particularly troublesome news repter  many other mysterious  odd  charachters f Harry Ron  Hermione to ponder  maybe even a love  terest f Hagrid! The plot was entertag wh a very suprisg yet  ftg endg  The book has all of JKR's humour trademark creative  names  new quirky charachters The Goblet is another one f the  recdbooks  f the enjoyment of children of all ages!  After The shock  at the end of the book JK leaves us wh a b of a clf-hanger f book  five(sigh) we will all have to wa patiently( impatiently)until next  time!  We will at least have a vague Idea of where the plot has to go next  year after all the myriad happengs this year at Hogwarts!
This is a great book The stie justs keeps gettg better  better sry I can't gieve  away  Read  f yourself
Anybody could tell you that the Harry Potter books arewonderful The latest Rowlg novel however proves  &quotHarryPotter  The Goblet of Fire&quot contues the adventures of Harry  his friends at Hogwarts   keeps the reader guessg at what's comg next JK  Rowlg's amazg style of wrg is extremely detailed she leaves no loose ends! I dare not reveal any of these fe pots to those who have not read this masterpiece yet but I will say  is defatly wth your time
My sons  I eagerly anticipated &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  I was certaly not disappoted! Thanks to Amazoncom's speedy delivery I spent a better part of 18 hours readg this wonderful tale Harry is better than  ever now that he understs his powers better  all of the characters  are becomg much me 3-dimensional-cludg evil Ld Valdemt! All of  the friends of Harry are back-RonHermione the kdly Mrs Weasley  The  first chapter is rather tense but sets the mood f the entire book   prepares you f what is to come As usual you are not sure whom Harry  should trust at all- even the end leaves you guessg I cannot wa to  read  out loud to my youngest but told my older one that he has to  fish &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot befe he starts &quotGoblet of  Fire&quot-he plans to do so immediately Now we have to s back   patiently wa f Book 5!
Although the book weighs  at over 700 pages there's not an ounce of fat on  Rather the extra length just gives the reader the wonderful opptuny to wallow  Harry Potter-dom f that much longerRowlg's tight plottg is all there I thought that the battles wh Voldemt   the first two books were a wee b too similar but every twist  this  book caught me by surprise Although the tone could be described as  &quotdarker&quot I see  me as Rowlg takg very seriously the  concerns of her young characters  her never doubtg that they are able  to make the brave  imptant contributions that they are called on to  makeBut f all that the book is still filled wh Rowlg's hum  Socks that &quotscream loudly when they became too smelly&quot Fred   Gege's &quotTon-Tongue Toffee&quot And the immensely gratyg sight  of Draco Malfoy transfmed to a ferret bouncg up  downAs wh  the last three books the end just leaves you wantg the next book Right  Away
Well The expectations f this book are almost unreal Regardless I just didn't like  as much as the first 3 I thk my problem lies  the pacg of the book It's just sooo long And while the book needed to be  that long to set up all the plot tricacies that makes Rowlg's book so  enjoyable the book's length keeps pushg the reader's expectations higher   higher It took 200 pages f the book to really get gog  500  (yes 500 pages) f  to beg to reach the level of tensy that made  Harry Potter 3 so credible It's dficult to contue to wre books  that are always  the same time frame (one school year)  Rowlg tries  to play wh that but the effect is me disarmg then anythg else You  want Harry to get to Hogwarts already! (not take 200-odd pages to get  there) The last 200 pages are excellent albe dark (i almost cried 3  times) It just took awhile to get to
This is one of the best books I've ever read JK Rowlgcombed several elements that when put together is sure to guaranteeher another year at the top of th NY Times bestseller list She wres  such a way that you can que lerally seem to feel what the character feels F stance when Harry is  danger I fd myself fearg f his le  However I won't spoil the book by revealg any details I recommend this book to all Potter fans   you're not a Potter fan 's high time you become one
I fully enjoyed every one of the 700+ pages  the fourth stallment of the Hogwarts saga Harry is a young man on the verge of adulthood wh his cohts at school  the evil doers at the do all set to do battle  (lookg fward to seeg how  all comes head to head  the 5th/6th/7th  books) The plot doesn't veer very far from the structure of the previous  books but there is a darker edge to the sty wh death  the first few  paragraphs twists  turns when you try to figure out who is Voldemt's  fahful servant  the memies of Azkaban trials  I probably won't be  the first to question Rowlgs' choice f the &quotbeloved  character&quot who dies (he didn't register the first time I read him   the previous books) But I did like the fleshg out of several of the  m characters wh questions  their future development as the books  evolve Get your copy  enjoy readg  wh other people!
This book was by far the best yet It kept me guessg aboutthe plot to the very end I can't wa until the nextstallment Nail bg suspense  a me grown up Harry transends from this book's pages
I'm 15  I have read all of the other Harry Potter books many times This book is the best so far I believe It has a lot of suspense  surprise   I couldn't put  down Two characters from the second   third books reappear- Sirus Black Harry's Godfather  Dobby the House  Elf The book also cludes the tradional encounter wh Ld Voldemt  only  is me tense than usual The only bad thg that I can thk of  about these books is that the fth one isn't out yet!
Wow!  I bought this at one  the mng on Saturday read  yesterday at the beach  fished  at two this afternoon (on Sunday) It's credible all seven hundred somethg pages of   Like the previous  books  the series  covers a year  the le of Harry Potter as he  goes through his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry  Wchcraft  Harry is now fourteen  has to deal not only wh the trials of  adolescence but also wh the growg power of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  Ld Voldemt  Back to help- hder- Harry  his trials this year are  his friends Ron  Hermione the headmaster Dumblede  many others  from the previous books cludg his godfather Sirius BlackI don't  want to spoil the book f those who haven't read  but the excement  this year at Hogwarts concerns the Triwizard Tournament a competion  among Hogwarts  two other rival schools of wchcraft  wizardry  Compets from other schools not only provide excement  the  tournament but also among the hearts of some students of Hogwartsbut  I'm not tellg who!  Suffice  to say this is a necessary read f  everyone who has read the others  the series  even those who haven't  will still enjoy   Though many may thk this series is just f kids  I'm livg proof that adults enjoy  too The layers of this book provide  a good sty f those just lookg f that but there are also ltle  nuggets f adults that kids may not catch especially  names  F  example Sirius Black Harry's godfather that we met  &quotPrisoner of  Azkaban is an Animagi who can turn to a big black dog  In astronomy  Sirius is the Dog Star  Ltle thgs like this make the books even  richerSo closg GO READ THIS BOOK!  In my opion  me than  lived up to all the hype surroundg s release  This fourth stallment   the Harry Potter series only makes me anticipate the next all the me
I wh the millions went  bought Haarry Potter IV Once I picked  up I could not help but read That night  I read from 5:00pm almost non stop until 2:15am the next mng By 2 I was at page 432 a wild recd f  me I fished  by the next eveng I am now considered a teenager at  age 13  appreciated the common suation an adolescent boy  this case  Harry goes through I highly recommend this book to all fellow readers  Although take my advice  don't read to much on the first day  you will  be downright angry at yourself f not spoilg such treasure
I recieved my copy this at 11 this mng(release date!)  could lerally not put  down This book was the best yet Rowlg is showg great new depths The Harry Potter series is really gettg good If you  even liked the first three this one you will *love* The characters are  fresh the plot thickens nicely  there are surprises around every  cner I read this book  ten hoursIt's still July the 8th  I'm  wonderg when I can expect the next one out already Is Amazon ready to  take pre-ders f the next book? Perhaps they should thk about !
Those who love Harry Potter are not to be disappoted  Great sty lots of trigue  new elements make the Goblet of Fire a must read  I was a ltle disappoted by some references  the novel which seemed too  commercial (Harry Potter mentions PlayStations) but the novel was genue  Rowlg
Havg waed  anticipation f months f the fourth part of the Harry Potter saga I was deeply disappoted Obviously aimg f an older audience this time the lengthly book was not anythg like as good as the  first 3 Not to give too much away the death of 'one of the ma  characters' was a real let-down as they could hardly be described as a  central character The middle part of the book where Harry  Ron's  hmone's kick  was remiscent to the previous books   my opion  the best part of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire However I still feel  JK Rowlg could have made better use of   extended  But the  rest of the book wh 's far darker undertones was a disapotment to  say the least I can only hope that this is not the way that JK Rowlg  will contue wh the 3 books  the series to come Although a good book  on s own comparg  wh the other 3 books  has none of the  brilliance that made Harry Potter such a phenomenal success
This book is the best Harry Potter book yet!   sce I thk that those books are the best that makes this the best book ever I bought  yesterday (july 8)  had fished  by the time I had to go to bed (9:30) Sce I had to pack f camp that afternoon AND go to a swim  party that's not bad I would most defely recommend this book to  anybody who likes books If you haven't read haarry potter yet now is the  time to start (Only you should read the other ones first) I hope i'm the  first person tto wre a review f this book bye jessica h
The fourth book is  my opion the best of the series It offers action gale a ltle b of mystery comedy romance  a chillg endg It is everythg the first three books were  so much me A defate must  read
The new Harry Potter book is deed a triumph by JK RowlgAs always her character development plotles  imagery shethrough Harry comes face-to-face wh some of his darkest fears  at the end of the book  becomes evident that the sides are beg drawn f the next three to come  Indeed this is a pivotal book  the series!By far the darkest book so far ( fact I'm a b concerned over the reaction my 10 year old may have wh some of the me vivid scenes) JK Rowlg neatly troduces young readers to feshadowg Some may guess who ends up dead I did only a few pages befe  happened Many old suspicions are answered  que a few me laid downHarry notices girls f the first time  predictably acts exactly as most 14 year old boys would act on a first date!  Ron creasgly becomes me uncomftable wh the dferences between he  Harry  Hermione also &quotre-creates&quot herself!The biggest developments of course occur wh Harry In all of his previous &quotle--death&quot struggles&quot he has been assisted somewhat by the &quotchair of the gods&quot technique ie  Fawkes arrivg at the EXACT spl second he needed him Hermione revealg at the last moment her &quottime-turner&quot This time there are no last mute rescues by friends but rather a much me mature Harry dealg wh evil himself  And at the end the reader can see the boyish layers peelg off  revealg me than a ht of the man to comeAn excellent read overall but unlike the other 3 I did not put this down wh a smile but rather a feelg of unease as the wld that JK Rowlg has vented feels creasgly me real wh each book
I purchased this book at ne am on July 8  read  nonstop until I fished at 7 pm This is by far the best of the Harry Potter books It certaly has a me developed mature voice to  than the others but  s' magical charmg tone is as wonderful as the first three books  Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts brgs all kds of new adventures as he is  chosen to represent his school  a Triwizard competion ptg him   dangerous tasks agast champions from two other wizardg schools Despe  s' great length the sty never feels overlong  the plot is fresh   engagg All the great old characters are back plus some good new  ones- we fally are troduced to Bill  Charlie Weasley! And  you  thk the first three books were excg this one is simply drippg wh  suspense I thk Harry's older me mature fans will fd this to be the  most pleasg Harry adventure to date due to s' tense themes  newly  troduced hmones between the Hogwarts students Wh traces of violence  romance  tragedy this book will defenly appeal to Harry Potter fans  young  old but I thk the readers like me around Harry's age of  fourteen will sk to  the most Don't miss this one- get your h on   as quickly as you can!
'Goblet of Fire' is my fave of the HP books so far - I'mreally impressed wh Rowlg's abily to 'grow' the texture of thesty along wh the characters  We learn me about Hogwarts' histy  place  the wld ga me spells me characters ( fabulous fantastic creatures) to adventure wh  me tightly woven details constructg the wizardg wld but the context of that wld (from Harry's view) also becomes me complex  Good still battles evil but now Harry begs to discern distct factions armg both sides  that not everyone is willg to choose a campTo make character development even me terestg he  his friends discover their own relationships are not as cleanly defed as they were last year  I laughed  wried as they struggled wh their unstable adolescenceI really admire Rowlgs' abily to 'grow' her level of stytellg along wh the complexy of the plot  characterization  I found this to be the funniest book so far temptg those awag their turn wh the book wh my frequent laughter  It also has the scariest consequences of the series so far as Rowlg reveals me details of exactly how Voldemt operatesAlthough I thk those 8-9 year olds tearg through the series will be me than satisfied wh Book 4 they may well appreciate  from a dferent vantage pot should they reread  later - but then all of the HP's benef from a second  third turn -  you can get them back from whoever you lent them  Brg on Number 5!
Harry Potter is terric! The book is full of suspensesurprises  's very long which is a good qualy  a goodbook It's a total page-turner   keeps you trigued right up to the last wd JK  Rowlg is a genius! She's done  aga!
I was wried that wh all the success of the series  the fact that this book was wrten  less time than the others that The Goblet Of Fire wouldn't be as good  Wrong  The 4th book may be my fave one!  It's nearly twice as long as the others wh all the fave characters from  the first  even me  The International Quiddich Cup  the Triwizard  Tournomant would seem to be wonderful thgs f any other young wizard  but when you're Harry Potter nothg is ever as  should be  Me of  You-Know-Who's suppters are lurkg but Harry has his friends Sirius   the new Defense Agast the Dark Arts profess on his side  Even me  mysteries abound  once aga who is friend  who is foe will  surprise you  Don't want to give too much away but 's dately a  must-read f Harry Potter fans  everyone else!
Yes 's true Harry Potter  the Goblet Of Fire is not as good as the first 3 books 's better As an spirg auth myself I found the book extremely good I bought the book on s first day  have already  completed :  surpassed all expectations However as the auth  promised  is darker than the first three- much darker We fd the Dark  Ld returng  all his power an unexpected death  terrible curses  The first three books were &quotfun&quot but this is truly darker even  sister but still betterI would recommend  f anyone above 10  (And I'm 14 myself)
This book was well wth the wa auth JK Rowlg has done  aga I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasies  lots of action at the same time You may thk that all the hype people were makg was so they  could hide the fact that the book wasn't great but guess what  is  excellent I have not read such a great book  all my le
My overwhelmg reaction after gettg this book was of heft The book is heavySo my question is: do the contents justy the weight? I was pretty wried sce successful auths frequently lose the self-control to  pare themselves down as see Kg's later wksYes  no On the  negative side I thk about 200 pages from this book could have been cut  whout feelg any ill effects This was the only one of the four Potter  books that I sometimes skimmed over  that I felt were a b slowOn  the other h the book sure kept me up all night turng the pages  Rowlg is one of the hardest wrers to put down sce I don't know  Asimov  somethgI felt there was a b of a disharmony between style   content: the style was aimed at very bright 12 year olds but the  content was aimed at 16 year olds  me I mean  was me than  "dark":  was paful gloomy grotesque hric - wh scenes  of tture  tragedy that would not have been out of place the Odyssey   even at times Dante But the vocabulary  sentence structure didn't at  times seem up f I f one could have used a ltle me brightness  - this book after a while was like spendg a couple of hours wh a  dement
Though I havn't fully read this book s meetg the igals aga I used to fish the Harry potter books of an avrage of 5 hours straight! This is an exeption So far s great!
Alright I adm I'm one of the post-pubescent fans But I love the Harry Potter books There's fally a mass followg f somethg wth-while Amazon kdly Fed-Exed Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire to us  I just  fished  about a half hour ago I don't usually s around  read a  734 page book  one day but I was so anxious to see what happened Though  this one was a b darker than the others  defately me mature-as  Harry  friends are growg up-JK Rowlg still held me captivated Her  characters were as great as usual still had me thkg &quotOh I hope  he/she isn't the villa!&quot The wrg still had me predictg thgs  occassionally my predictions were on-track And though my eyes were gettg  tired I was disappoted when the sty was fished I guess I shouldn't  have read  so quickly Who knows when the next one is comg out? Anyway  I highly recommend this book as wh all the other Harry Potters They're  pure enjoyment

I thought  was great It is surely a 5 star book If  is possible  is even me exg than the first three i defely recommend buyg !
Joanne Rowlg has done  aga! In this book Hazza P displays his courage  tacklg the hrs of beg a totally nmal teenage boy  a crowd of ignant idiotsHe is my hero! Through bravely takg on the  dficult task of lettg her charmg character grow up to a mature man  Joanne Rowlg has shown her competance as a biographical wrer  made a  place f herself among the greats  the histy book of le I thk i  can talk f the whole of the uned kgdom  sayg that Joanne Rowlg  takes the place of Prcess Diana as our English Rose! I love you!
This book was very terestg  Much longer than the otherprevious books  is the climax of the series so far  I should notspoil the book f new readers but I thought that the use of the polyjuice potion  a deranged news repter were a very lethal combation  Therefe I give this book a five-star ratg
I thought Harry potter  the goblet of fire was a super bookIt was so good I read  all  one day you could not put  down  was so rivg I hope the next book will be out soon!
I won't give away the plot -- 's too good! -- but Jo Rowlg's wrg just keeps gettg better  better!  This new sty has enough mysteries  red herrgs to please an Agatha Christie  Raymon Chler fan  enough hum f readers of Roald Dahl  Beverly Cleary enough magic f  lovers of Diana Wynne Jones E Nesb  Edward Eager  enough  adventure f fans of Lloyd Alexer Susan Cooper  Brian Jacques  And best of all --  has all the special enchantment that only JK  Rowlg creates!  Suspenseful hilarious excg magical  touchg  by turns this sty is clearly the pivotal tale  young Harry Potter's  adventures  In a book filled wh surprises the biggest one of all may be  that this 734 page book ends much too soon!
this is by far the best stallment of the harry potter books  starts out a b slow but picks up towrds the middle i would recomend this book to any one who has read the other harry potters

If I could give this book 10 stars I would whout a doubt Some thk that Harry Potter is childish  only f children That is not so Harry Potter is f all ages Incase your wonderg Harry Potter is a 14 year  old wizard that goes to a wizard school named: Hogwartz There he meets  his many friends Ron Hermoe Hargrid  many me This book is  suspensful funny emotional  just pla stupendious!

I'm 10 I just got the book today I'm  the 300's! This bookis great --  gets kids readg f pleasure stead of bg schoolreadgsI love this book  'll be  my collection f a loooooooong time!
I just fished readg this book moments ago  I must saythat I thk  is just as fantastic as the last three! There are awhole bunch of new characters  the sty has a surprisg twist at the end I can't wa f the 5th book to come out now!
I'm not even done wh  yet  i thk  is by far the best book  the series    you fd out about the other wizardg schools a triwizard tourement  some new  fasatg characters  i can't say too much  give away the fun of readg   He-who-must-not-be-named is  back to his old tricks though  Dobby the house-elf is wkg at hogwarts  Hermione is once aga livg  the library  ron  harry are  a  fight   Harry once aga stumbles to trouble when his name suddenly  pops out of the Goblet of Fire f a contest that only 17  older could  enter!  What will he do next?  Don't you wish you knew? hehehe :)
This Harry Potter book is truly the best of the series  It is a pageturner I couldn't put  down  I thk anybody who love fantasy will love this book
This is by far the best of the Harry Potter series  JK Rowlg grabs you  the first three chaptes  causes you to laugh uncontrollably catch your breath  fear  tears will undoubtably fill your eyes wh the  credible kdness of Mr Weasley  It only gets better from there  I  know that you won't want to wa til July 2001 to fd out what happens  next eher!
Rather than beg by summarizg the sty I shall straight off say that this book Rowlg's most expensive most lengthy  by far the most  anticipated  (I don't remember any all night parties f Book 2 do you?)  defately gives the reader a run f their money  The 700 page novel is  filled to brim wh action though as one might expect wh a book of such  length runs on a b  But take note  DEFINATELY does not drag  In  fact the sty is a page turner right to the very end  As wh many good  books the reader is dragged   the size of the book is fgotten   the tensy of the sty  Personally I liked seeg the magical wld  exped as new nationalies of wizards  wches are troduced  I do  not consider this the greatest novel of all time  does exhib lerary  weaknesses  Some characters stead of takg on me depth as the sty  unfolds are merely reerated somewhat cessantly  Is the endg  needlessly complicated?  I thk that once unfolded the villas' evil  plans are extremely confusg However Rowlg is dealg wh an  imagary  magical wld none too simple  s wkgs  which must  be explaed whout contradictg self  The books many adventures may  be a b confusg  drawn out f younger audiences but  is certaly  one of the most excg children's novels to come along  a while  Above all Rowlg exhibs a defate flair f hum  suspense  Whout a doubt her imagative  colful stytellg are her greatest  assets  The characters  the wld she creates reveal an imagation  rivalg that of Gege Lucas  This 4th stallment is a wthy addion  to the shelf of previously acclaimed Harry Potter novels  lives up to  the illustrious legacy A good buy whether you've read all the books   not Indeed Rowlg hasn't lost her touch
This is the best book I've ever read  my le JK Rowlg is sure to sce another bestseller  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot The details are amazg I purchased this book at 's midnight release  read until mng!  I don't want to give too much away all I  can say is 's fabulous!
JK Rowlg has done  aga! The fourth book is the most enthrallg book  the series  As Harry competed  the Triwizard Tournament agast Cedric Diggy Fleur Delacrou  Vikt Krum I got a feelg of excement that had never befe coursed through my ves  The  climatic showdown  the end is truly the best part of the book I believe  that this is the best Harry Potter book ever

This one is a fair b darker  much less simple than the earlier books  Thgs are not what they at first seemIf you've grown up wh the series (ie you read ( you dad read to you) the first one when you  were six  then you read each subsequent book as  came out) then you  are necessarily older  me wldly  this book's edgess will not  overwhelmIf today you are 6 years old  haven't read any Potter  yet  read straight through all four tles then this one might scare  youIt does leave you desparately wag f the next oneAnd from  seeg all the kids wh their parents at the Crown Books this mng  this series is dog wonders f the leracy level of Generation Z

I had anticipated the release of this book ever sce I had started the Harry Potter series This time Harry does not struggle as much wh the Dursleys as he is only there f two weeks He spends the rest of the  summer wh the Weasleys who take him  Hermione to the Quiddch fal  Bulgaria vs Irel After the tournament a dark sign is seen  the sky  It is the sign of the Dark Ld Ld Voldemt There is much wry about  you-know-who comg back to power As Harry arrives at Hogwarts there is  the disappotg news that there will no house quiddch games Instead  Hogwarts will be hostg the Triwizard Tournament  two feign wizardg  schools will be comg to Hogwarts to take part There has not been one f  a hundred years because of contestants beg killed Students age 17   over are to subm their names to the Goblet of Fire  that will choose  the three contestants one from each school As the three chosen  contestants march off the goblet shoots another name from s mouth  &quotHarry Potter&quot Everyone was astonished because Harry would not  have been able to get past the age barrier the headmaster put around the  goblet to keep younger students out Harry himself did not subm his name   he did not ask anyone to In the book you re-meet many characters  cludg Moang Myrtle Dobby the House Elf  Charlie Weasley One  warng  the begng there are many new characters to keep track of  so pay attention!
Harry Potter is off  runng aga  this wonderfully wrten saga of his fourth year at Hogwarts  The new characters are as rich  excg   all of the ones we have come to love  The Triwizard Tournament is  suspenseful yet hum  adolesencent fun are there too  I hope you all  enjoy this book as much as I did  I can't wa f the fth year at  Hogwarts!
Although this book was long my daughter  I loved   We got  this mng  couldn't put  downWhat I like about Rowlg's sties is her consistency  use of the characters  She weaves new  old  characters  the fabric of her sties  Most of the rums were true  about this book but as always the endg was dferent than I had hoped  My daughter missed Harry Potter playg his fave spt Quiddch  However sce there is so much to this book to tell me wouldn't be a  good idea In every school year we like Harry learn so much about this  magic wld of Rowlg's  She really keeps the action gog  her  sties like the Sirius Black suation She captures her audience  this  wonderfully wrten sty about a boy  his journey to become a wizard  This truly is a magical series that will take you where no imagation has  gone befe You can picture this wld of magic excement mystery   enchantment all rolled to one sty  After readg this sty I now  me theies about the seventh book  However I thk Ms Rowlgs will  surprise meBy the way PETA might have some grievance agast Sirius  I was very happy to see him backAlso I changed my opion of Snape   this book  Snape  Sirius - start of beautul friendship?
How could any auth's wk match the hype that has surrounded this book?  She pulled  off  Great new characters me tensy  better constructs make this an stant h  This has many of the familiar rhythms  of the first three books  the series but manages to be fresh  new at  the same time  I got the book at midnight last night  couldn't put   down until I devoured   A fun read

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  starts off from where Book 3 Prisoner of Azkaban ended wh Harry at his  Uncle Vernon's home A startlg nightmare awakens him  he is confused  as to s meang It turns out that all is not well  the wizardg  wld  that an evil plot is brewg  the shadows All the time  avoidg his enemies ( fdg time along the way f a b of romance)  young Potter must fd a way to quell the problem  set thgs right  aga If you have read the other three books be sure to pick this one up  right away You'll be pleasantly surprised
I bought Harry Potter IV f two ma reasons:  my children  I enjoyed the first three episodes  a desire to fd out which of the many rums floatg around happened to be true I found this episode even me  enjoyable than the last Harry is growg up  capable of dog many  thgs-even  he has doubts about beg able to do them The book never  seemed to get to a slow pot that was hard to get throughbut smoothly  went from chapter to chapter wh ease When I fished the book I was  still ready to keep readg  will have to wa patiently until the next  stallment is released F all those unfamiliar wh Harryhe is  enjoyable f all ages  wth the read
well she did  aga J K rowlg made another AMAZING harry potter book she just throws somethg else  's amazg!  what I wouldn't give to see what goes on sdie her bra this large book starts off much dferent from the rest but somehow just like them It's the best yet  read   you WON&quotT be dissapoted
i cant belleve  jkrowlg has done  aga she has made a book better than the the last
J K Rowlg has accomplished a task every b as dficult as apparatg  summong a Patronus:  she has wrten a book which exceeds the hype surroundg s release  I couldn't put  down  read   one  stg befe turng  over to my eleven-year-old daughterRowlg's careful plottg of her seven-tome series is nowhere me  evident than  this fourth stallment  She ties together events from the  earlier books wh tantalizg hts about what is to come  Her characters  stay true to themselves while contug to grow  mature  Many auths  struggle keepg this kd of consistency  a series but Rowlg succeeds  beautully  Fans of the series will particularly enjoy how Rowlg starts  to flesh out secondary characters now that Harry  his friends are well  establishedA few warngs: although Rowlg recaps some elements from  previous books a reader begng the series  the middle will no doubt  be confused  This is one series that really must be read sequentially  Also the evil elements become even darker  scarier  this stallment  Some events might be too gruesome f younger children to hear  Any child  mature enough to read a 742 page book though should be able to hle the  darker materialAs the pivotal book of the series The Goblet of Fire  really leaves the reader  suspense at the end--much like the end of The  Empire Strikes Back  the Star Wars Trilogy--meang that there will be  even me hype surroundg the release of volume five which can't happen  too soon to su me!
I loved the book I don't wanna give to much away but  is great Lots of new twists  some love put  there Makes a great new addion  a wonderful book
I just watched an terview of JK Rowlg the auth of Harry Potter I can't believe this shy woman wrote the series books of Harry Potter a boy's advanture The book is imagative Well I must be excg  I  were 10 years old  less
It's hard f any book to measure up to this kd of hype -- but Rowlg's fans will be happy to know that Potter IV is every b as good as s predecesss (at least so far -- I wre this half-way through the  adventure)  In fact so far 's my fave of the seriesI don't want  to post even the smallest spoiler but the premise is excg   unexpected but  volves the usual mix of boardign school drama magic   mayhem Rowlg is really great  I love what she's done f  children's books Now  you'll excuse me I have to get back to The Goblet  of Fire
Fed Ex delivered at 1:30 pm  I read straight through (wh a sht break f dner) to fish this book  one day! This book kept me hoverg on the edge the whole time I liked  because I could relate to  some of the thgs that happened to Harry (You'll have to read   yourself!)  &quotShiva's Fire&quot was equal wh this book  This book  is just as terestg as the other  Harry Potter books but I don't  reccomend  f kids under the age of 4/5 because there are a lot of  fights  deaths (I am 13)
I fished readg this book today  I must say that  is the most tricate  best Harry Potter book yet It is a must read f people who have read the first three Potter books
In this book Wmtail reappears along wh the evil Ld Voldemt Harry is  contact wh Sirius  develops a crush on Cho Chang If you haven't already gotten the book GET IT NOW!
Befe I got this book I was wried that  would not be as good as the other three  As soon as I read the first page I knew that I didn't need to wry any meI really like all the new characters the plot is extremely terestg (just like the other ones)JK Rowlg has done   aga!
the fourth harry potter book is dferent from any of the booksso far  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is much me frighteng serious than the last three  It is sad scary funny  a fabulous book  It has romance the first time we've seen 
this is great!  the first chapter doesnt make sense to later on but i love this!  i hope all the books are this size- great plot le  chacters! i loved  sooooooo much!  whens the next one?
This book was a okay book but  kept remdg me of Fan Fic no one we care about died   harry doesn't go out wh some one as hted (but  you count one dance wh an odd weirdo gog out) there was a mistake JK  said that fred  gege where 15  then after dumblede said stuff  about beg 17 to enter they claimed that they only needed a few me  monthes to enter the triwizard tnament! But the book was okay
JK Rowlg has woven another tail of pure joy excement  suspence The new stallment  the 7 book series is 734 pages of nothg but pure delight A must read f all ages I recieved my copy not 5 hours  ago  I have failed to put  down sce HARRY POTTER 4 is a must f  all
I started readg this wonderful book  could not keep my hs off  It took me about 18 hours to read this magical book  Harry is  luck this summer  The Dursley's have willgly let Harry stay wh Weasley's  Durg his vis they discover a dark mark that tells them the Dark Ld  will be me powerful then ever befe  But Harry has me problems then  Volderme  F one thg Harry's name was picked to compete agast  dferent schools f the goblet of fire  As Harry reveals his adventure  he fds secrets about his friends  Secrets that would be better left  untold  Like most of J K Rowlg's books the Defendant Agast the Dark  teacher has somethg imptant to do wh the sty  This is defely a  must read bookSamantha Woodwth  (11years old)
I really enjoyed this book  There is not a lot I can say  detail  Savvy readers of the previous books will fd themselves unavoidably reachg premature conclusions  I say anythg other than this was a very  good book  As has been stated  the press this book is a turng pot  f the series  It matas all of the familiar elements while contug  to grow  a constantly maturg fashion  I hope you all enjoy the book as  much as I did
Rowlg has surpassed herself wh Harry Potter Four The plot was genious however I was left wh a feelg of despair at the end of the book  I was lookg fward to me adventure  ended up distressed about where the series was gog I  hope that the febodg mood at the end will be resolved
I'm 10  not a big reader but I ABSOLUTLY LOVE HPotter books! I couldn't wa f the 4th book to come out  I'm half way through the book  less than 24 hours I've noticed that there have  been a lot of d**ns  the book It bothers me because most of her readers  are kids even ltle kids 4 years of age have thier parents read these  books to them It might be offencive to some people who read H Potter  books I dont see the need f swearg  childrens  leratureespecially wh an auth as tallented as JK Rowlg! Even  though I made this complat this 4th book is the best book the best  series I've ever read!
Surprisgly this book was even better then the first three I bought the book yesterday (July 8th)  could not put  down yes  was que long but I manged to fish  by midnight (I read under the covers) The  plot was very excg  even though  was 640 pages (I have the  Canadian/Brish version)  did not drag on The sty takes us back to  Hogwarts School  Ms Rowlg once aga amazed me wh her vivid  description of the magical wld that Harry is a part of Ron  Hermione  are back helpg Harry  his latest adventure Insted of Quiddch the  ma event f this book is The Triwizard tournament a competion  wh  two other wizardg schools Rowlg keeps the reader guessg to almost  the last page as to who a follower of You-Know-Who  who isn't I really  enjoyed this book but I wouldn't recomend this book f anyone under ten  because the end this que scary I'm fourteen  i was que frightened  Over all this was a wonderful book that encourages children to read  use  their imagenations
I loved the igal Harry Potter books The Prisoner of Azkaban beg my fmer fave The Goblet of Fire is now my fave of the four by far This is The Empire Strikes Back The Godfather 2  The Termat 2 of  the Harry Potter books the sty is a darkly satisfyg tale documentg  Harry Potter's 4th year of Wizard school  the return of Ld Voldemt  Rowlg goes all out to wre the sty that needs to be told stead of  tryg to please all of her young  old readers a like wh a happy   predictable sty I could not put the book down  ended up readg this  734 page novel  about 1 day I recommend this to any fan of Harry   any fan of lerature  general
I would like to start off by sayg that I could not put this book down after I bought  at 12:15 AM  I spent Saurday July 8(no sleep volved) readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  It was impossible to put the  book down  I found myself sprtg between the bathroom  my Bedroom so  as to spend as ltle time as possible not lookg at the Book  Now I will  tell you WHY  was so amazg  Ever sce 'The Prisoner of Azkaban'  came out I have been wonderg so many thgs about the wizardg wld  'The Goblet of Fire' has unshrouded all of this mystery  I mean all  you  learn about the Stg hat the other houses Hagrid Dumblede the  Weasleys the mistry other wizardg schools how the magical wld  wks  yes even me about the dark days 13 years ago(If you don't  know what i'm talkg about read books 1  2  3)  It is almost as   JK Rowlg took a tantalizg steak cooked to perfection  allowed me  to enjoy all 734 pageserr I mean bes of   If you ever had a  dream about beg a hero wizard wch  vigilante this is the book f  you well at least until book 5 comes out
Whout a doubt the Harry Potter books may by themselves brg back quiet afternoon readg I received this 734 page missive via Sat delivery (thank you Amazon)  settled  f several hours of readgThe Goblet of  Fire contues the tradional events of the previous books but wh me  character development  The pace is unfunately slower  will lack the  excement found  the Quiddch matches of the previous books  The  appeal of real-le however wh the fallg out of friends the dreaded  &quotfirst-date&quot scenario will resonate well wh the equivalent age  group as well as the adults who remember this book It did lack the  credible visual imagion appeal of the eaarlier books where people  nearly lived scenes (Quiddch facg down Tom Riddle  his snake)  leavg us to wk harder to make  sgHarry's usual le--death  dealgs do keep you readg but I found the endg to be tamer than  earlier books All  all a slower pace me emotion  characer  development me teraction will make this a satisfyg read f older  readers but the excement  thrill of the earlier books as well as the  escapism of Hogwarts will make this a tougher sell to younger readers like  my son Indeed certa aspects might lead to real-wld discussssions on  death  dyg on hon  on fairnessI'd still recommend this book  I read  straight through  The only headache I have now is wag f  the next volume to appear ( tryg to decide  the movie is a good  idea
A great book The plot was astoundg I was totally engrossed  this book  I read  non-stop through the night just to see what would happen I know this review seems pretty stupid but man! The book was the  best I've ever read!
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is the best book  the Harry Potter series so far  Some parts were funny  other parts were st of scary  I fished readg the book  less than 22 hours after my  dad bought  f me!  I can't wa f the fth one!
While I will not reveal who dies  the ma focus of the plot let me say this  It is well wth the wa  the long read  Rowlg shows the depth of emotions wh hercharacters from joy fear srow   treachery  This book is the midpot of the series  sets the stage f  the next few books well  I am already wag f the next book
I have just fished readg the new Harry Potter book: Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  I enjoyed  tremendously  I would like to reccomend  to all the Harry Potter fans  to those who have not yet  caught on to the wonderful books I will not go to details on the book  because I do not wish to spoil  f you  Deffately get this book!  You   your child(ren) will read  aga  aga!
I liked the book except f s length (but that might be because I stayed up all night to read   was grouchy the next day) There were a variety of reasons f my likg :1)It had the usual twisty endg --  who you thk  is ( who I thought  was although f maybe lack of  sleep) really isn't  whatnot2)You fd out a lot of terestg  tidbs about characters like Snape Hagrid Malfroy the new DAtDA  Voldemt  Neville (as to why he lives wh his grmother I thought  this was so sad)3) We meet new schools!  And new animals!4) I  learned how a Wizard repter can wre like a Muggle Tabloid wrer  :-)5)Two of the Mauraders make imptant appearances thoughout the book   one Maurader  his company prove to really help Harry  a tight  squeeze (which two I'm not tellg but you can probably figure   out)6) The truly wonderful details  realistic-ness7) MY fave  character didn't die!  I can't tell you who though8) This book SCREAMS  f the 5th There are these ltle details that are left danglg wh  those oh-so-subtle hts Ms Rowlg leaves! Man a whole new year to wa!  Back to the rum boards   There are probably many me reasons that  have just eluded my memy right now Aside from the length there was only  one thg that really made me sad -- I didn't get to hear that much about  my fave Profess Guess who!
I adm I was a b wried Wh all the buildup  hype  so fth f the release of the 4th stallment  the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up that all the excement would be f  nothg But the brilliant JK Rowlg has done  aga- wh a book  that  my opion is the best  the series so far In this book Harry  sees the Quiddch Wld Cup discovers girls is entered  a st of  spell duel meets some new friends  foes becomes farther  then  closer to his friend Ron  once aga has a brush wh well  You-Know-Who but I won't give  all away After hungrily devourg  over 700 pages of glious fiction  about 4 hours I was left wh a gr  on my face a feelg of triumph f Harry  a pang that told me the  book was over  that alas I would have to wa a while f the  sequel Thank you JK Rowlg! What a wonderful magical phenomenon you  have created
Wow! i read this book  i loved ! (f the most partanyways) i couldn't put  down  the plot was very clever terestg (though  dragged  a few parts) the book was defly darker  scarier but  still retaed the charm that was  the first 3  J K Rowlg has this knack of leadg you to believe one thg  twistg  all around  wonderfully done!
Harry Potter seems like a great book f kids to read  is except f the fact that harry potter has the EXACT same style  characters as books called narnia The chronicles of narnia are the true Harry Potter books I REALLY ADVISE YOU TO READ THEM FIRST  It makes me really sad [that the auth] needs to copy an idea from a not so popular series of books  Please read Narnia!
When I first picked up the latest  the Harry Potter series I wondered why  was so thick  comparison to the other books The reason f this is that 's full of action as well as imptant character developments I  read  as eagerly  quickly as any of the other booksHarry Potter   the Goblet of Fire is longer  me volved but 's appropriate  as Harry has just turned 14  his le has become me volved The  changes  the lives of Harry  his friends are addressed really well  Though they are wizards  wches they are young teenagers now  deal  wh the universal adolescent themes of flirtg  appearance However  this book has not turned the series to a series of romance novels by any  stretch of the imagation! There's still me to be discovered at  Hogwarts  me evil to be fought As Harry grows older  me  complex so does his battle wh evil  his search f the truth It can  only get me terestg from here
Befe I started this book I was afraid that  would follow the trend of disappotment which usually accompanies sequels  However all my fears were f naught as I can honestly say that I thk this is the best Harry  Potter book yet  I could not put  down  I don't know how JK Rowlg  can come up wh these sties but they contue to have a richer plot  than any other book I have read  What makes THE GOBLET OF FIRE better  than the first three?  Well I found that not only is the plot deeper but  Rowlg also has advanced  her abily to express the suations   emotions that accompany her characters  She nails the personaly shts  of her characters perfectly  they seem to float off the page  act  out the sty  front of you  It is as  she has experienced the sty  personally  is just describg what  was like The endg of this  book is credible I don't thk I breathed durg the last hundred   fty pages  If any kids out there are timidated by the size of this  novel don't be  It is well wth the efft
It's a really great book Harry notices girls He's constantly beg bothered by a daily prophet journalist Harry notices girls Black is back!  Hogwarts hosts the Triwizard tournament Voldemt strikes harder than  ever but Harry escapes  Voldemt remas  not only does he  remas but he's back to full power  his own human body  all
I love this book! I could notput  down ! Harry(our beloved hero) is gog back to his fourth year at Hogwarts But first he is ved by the Weasly's to go see the Quiddch wld cup! After the terric game they go  back to their tent  Harry has his first  run  wh the Death Eaters!  ( Old Voldermt followers ) Harry goes back to school  fds out that  there will be a  Triwizard Tournament Harry is picked to participate after  an excg twist He then has to complete 3 darg tasks On the fal  task he meets LORD VOLDERMORT !  He who must not be named is back! The  sty ends  everythg unfolds
This book is GREAT!  I read the whole book  one night after wagan hour to get  by the time I got home  was 1:30am I just decidedI would read a couple pages then go to sleep after I read the first chapter I couldnt put  down!  I kept readg  readg  readg I looked at the time every so often by the time I was  the middle  was 3:00am i wasn't tired at ALL!  The book was so terestg  excg I couldn't put  down I was on the last chapter not even carg what time  was i fally fished the book at 6:50am!  I stayed up the whole night readg the whole book cover to cover!  wh only one break  that was  the bathroom  I even read  there  you thk you wont like this book thk aga!  i HIGHLY recomend !
Harry Potter number 4 is possibly the best books yet! I was thrilled when  came out  was so exicted when I read  This book was full of hum There were times when I couldn't stop laughg I didn't want to put this  book down Parts of this book make you want to cry  laugh I am thrilled  that is fally out  because of the clf-hanger I cannot wa f  number 5!
As enjoyable as I have found the Potter series I had sensed a levelg off  my terest  Book 2 had a similar plot to number 1  while book 3 was me entertag than 1  2 I felt as  the series wasn't gog  anywhere  Well thgs have changed mightily  book number 4  You can  now sense an arc to the overall style (as I'm sure everybody knows  Rowlg already has an outle of how the 7 books  the series are gog  to go)  I found this book to far me excg  much darker than the  rest  There is now a real sense of danger  the series that I didn't feel  -despe attempts by the auth - befe  I believe this book vaults the  series once  f all to a series that can be appreciated by adults as  much as by children  Though I am a fast reader  took me less than a  full day to fish the book  You won't want to put  down  The only  complat you may have when you're done is that now that the series has  become truly grippg you have to wa  agony f number 5
The new Harry Potter is absolutely outstg  JK Rowlg has outdone herself wh this 752 page masterpiece!  Harry Potter fds himself  new suations wh the same fascatg friends to help him through the hard  times  Although he doesn't try to attract  me  me people are  awestruck by Harry ( not just us real Muggles)  Harry fds his love  his courage  a whole lot me  this stunng new book
Wow! Took me a ltle less than 2 days to read the whole bookas the only time I put  down was to fall asleep I don't want togive anythg away but I have to say Ms Rowlg contues to weave a great sty about Harry his friends  their adventures True to fm the plot is wonderful  has all of the big  ltle surprises at the end that ties everythg together which I believe is her trademarkThe only bummer about the book was fishg   realizg I have to wa till next year f the 5th book
OMG! This is truly the best book that I have ever read! The moment I got  yesterday to a few hours ago I had lerally been hooked on JK Rowlgs every wd! This book is better then the first three no doubt  the others were awesome too so that should tell you somethg! I will be  wag wh anticipation f her next book! Thank you so much JK Rowlg   keep wrg!
The latest stallment  the Harry Potter series is a fantastic book Ms Rowlg weaves a complex plot which leaves you guessg to the very end of the sty The Goblet of Fire is much darker  scarier than the first  three books Voldemt has a large part  this book where he tryg to  rega power And f all the Quiddch fans the only Quiddch played   this game  is the Quiddch Wld Cup(Irel vs Bulgaria)! However there  is somethg equally excg to replace Don't miss the Goblet of Fire!
This highly excg new book is most likely the best one yet  It tells the sty of the wld famous wizard Harry Potter  Harry was phaned when he was one year old by the most evil wizard of all times  When the wizard tries to kill Harry the spell bounces off of Harry  redoubles on the  dark wizard  Harry grows up wh his aunt  uncle who  &quotfget&quot to tell Harry what really killed his parents In book  one Harry is taken to the Hogwarts school of Wchcraft  Wizardry where  he is traed  becomg a wizard  F those of you that don't approve  of books about magic the book is credibly light-hearted  humous  Magic just makes the hum  the book me funny  I mean how often are  you verbally sulted by your mirr?  This book has the same touch of  style as all the other books  There is an creadible amount of hum that  makes you want to come back f me  The book plays as hum fantacy  mystery  adventure  This book apeals to most everybody  Harry  lives a nmal le wh a twist  He has to get along whh his evil  cous fish homewk keep out of the way of various ghosts hauntg his  school keep away from a killer wizard  avoid beg turned to a  canary by enchanted desserts his trick-playg friends provide  Harry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a book everyone should love  It has all  the elements of a great book plus a suprise endg that is sure to leave  you stunned
I thk that these Harry Potter boooks brg a new light to readg  at first i thought the Harry Potter books were f ltle kkids but thrn i got the first three fr christmas  i couldent put them down  i used to hate  readg now at scool i cant wa till i get to read my Harry Potter books  I also thk that JK Rowlg shoudent just make 7 books but me to see  what Harry  hhis friends do  le  see of he gets married  to Cho  Chang   they have kids then have her wre about Harrys kids gog to  Hogwarts
i thk that the goblet of fire was her greatest book yet   was longer than all the other ones  that made  even better  It was also  slightly darker  me adult than the other books although  did have  s share of funny moments  I would defely recomend this book to  anyone kid  adult
I only read Half of  so I can't say much but to not buy  would the biggest mistake of your le I can only wre a ltle because i have to get the book F those who say &quot way to long f  me&quot I bet  you  you like the Harry Potter series you will fsh   2 weeks I  promise Cause Harry Potter is #1!
WOW!  JK Rowlg is amazg  The first three book were great but the fourth surpassed my expectations  The excement starts  the first chapter  doesn't end  We get to learn me about our fave  characters(Hagrid's parents) meet some new ones(we fally get to meet  Charlie  Bill)  discover a much bigger wld of wchcraft  The book  is funny(Dudley on a diet) excg  tragic(yes someone does die)  I  laughed  cried  I couldn't put  down  The next year at Hogwart's  looks to be even me amazg  All I can ask now is when does the next  one come out?
I was thrilled to see that Amazoncom had sent the fourth Harry Potter book right on July 8th  I vowed to read  all on that very day! So I set to my task  I did fish  at 8 O'Clock But I found  rather  dissapotg There was a lack of depth  the characters the depth that  had been there befe The plot was good but weak It seemed too much like  all the others &quotLd Voldemt is after Harry&quot aga As the  other plot's held me throughout the book this one didn't What did keep me  gog though was the fact that I was gog to fd out who the Death  Eater's wereHowever JK Rowlg does tell us me about Voldemt's  past  even his family She also expled how Harry's status can falter  Wh that annoyg news repter that is who put's up all sts of rums  about Harry  turns all his peers agast him (&quotPotter  Stks&quot) I enjoyed that because 's obvious that not everyone can  like Harry (Ex-cludg the Dark Wizards)I would give this book 2 1/2  stars but obviously you can't do that on Amazoncom (So I put three  stead) So do get the book  is wth  but just don't come to me  when you see 's not que as good as the others But never fear JK  Rowlg one semi-good book does not turn me away from Harry I am still up  to readg the rest as I'm sure the rest of you will be
Fans of Harry Potter who stayed up till the clocks struck 12:01on Saturday mng will not be let down The latest enstallment hasall the thgs that make people of all ages come back to these books aga  aga  The sty will be a disappotment f quiddch fans though there is flyg  quiddch players throughout the sty However the tournament which takes the place of quiddch matches me than makes up f the lack of quiddch The Triwizard Tournament is what this book revolves around   pleasgly fills the 700+ pages this book encompases  This book does take a slightly darker turn   will probably get some flack over some of the darker issues (sany tture)  exples However  a fantasy series there must always be some danger  evil  these issues are dealt wh  the same expert manner that Ms Rowlg has dealt wh all other possibly objectionable themes  her books  Overall this book seems to contue the trend of a slightly me grown up attude both  s audience  the manner  which  treats the characters It is only ftg that as Harry  the gang grow up so do the books  Overall well wth givg up a day a week a month whatever to read this book!
I have read all three HP books to my two boys ages 11 &amp 13 all of which we have loved The first  third  the series were our faves This series is f young  old brgg the reader on a magic &quotfire  bolt&quot ride through fantasyl We have just heard that #4 is &quot  the mail&quot  we're on the edge of our broomsticks wag to read !  What a delightful way to spend summer evengs Don't miss out on Harry  Potter!
JK Rowlg certaly doesn't disappot wh her new tale of Harry's adventures at Hogwarts  She creates amazg new magical creatures f Hagrid to care f  keeps the reader guessg at every turn  Who is  truly Voldemt's servant?  Who will w at the end?  Defely a darker  feelg than the other three books but well wth the efft  takes to  get through the sty! I was astounded  many parts when dferent  identies were revealed  Rowlg gives lots of background fmation  regardg the bygone days of Voldemt's reign of terr  Overall a  fascatg book that I tend to read aga soon!
Well s brilliant just like all the others Its hard to wre about  whout givg away the plot but harry is 14 now  JK Rowlg has obviously decided that s time he  the books grew up a b Its a lot  longer  also darker than the other books have been but just as  excg Wh seven books  the series somethg me than quiddch  matches have to happen to get the plot movg Some of you might be  f  a shock but we all knew  had to happen! If you're dherg about  whether to buy   not go f  s well wth the money  the  subject matter is gog to st the test of time
I've loved all of the first three Harry Potter books Wh this one the authess has surpassed herself -  lerally takes the series to a new levelWhat a stunng book! Much darker than the first three disturbg   even frighteng  places but keepg the same sense of humour   fun that has characterised the series the Goblet of Fire is a wild ride   bodes well f the future The one fly  the otment is gog to be  the long long wa f book 5I can't recommend this book highly enough
This book is defately the best of the four! JK Rowlg is the best auth that i have ever heard of  her imagation shows so much  this book  is amazg!

F those of you who can't get enough of Harry Potter this book is absolutely perfect  My only complat about the series so far is simply not havg enough to read but the 734-page fourth book Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire solves that problem  It has all the appeal of our  beloved three igal books wh tons of new characters excg twists   me sights to Harry's past  This book almost reads like a  mystery as the reader is not completely filled  on present events   hts dropped along the way can be used to piece together what will happen   the end  Consider yourself warned: the only displeasg aspect of the  book is the somewhat dropoff endg  The other books of the series end  wh some kd of triumph on Harry's part  you walk away knowg that  me problems may arise but thgs are all right f the time beg  However the problem presented  Book Four has only begun to be solved by  s conclusion  Enjoy!

This has defetly been the best book  the series so far! It was full of action  adventure The plot was really good because  had many ltle twists to  I was a ltle disappoted that Cho  Harry didn't get together but everythg else was great!

WARNING: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T READ BOOK 4 IT GIVES SOME MAJOR SPOILERS!In a change toward darkness from her first two novels the fourth book  Rowlg's Harry Potter series is a wonderful book which not  only lives up to the legacy of her first three books but also lives beyond   From the begng of his summer thgs are strange Harry has a  strange vision that makes his scar a souveir of the time he survived  Voldemt hurt Then there are other strange thgs which happen  cumulatg to when Harry's name is chosen f the triwizard duel even  though he didn't put his name   he was underage He then had to  accomplish three tasks  the last was the hardest of allf there he  meets his greatest enemy VoldemtThis book is considerably darker   me scary than the previous three However  is still an excellent  piece of lerature It leaves the reader ( at least me) cryg from  Cedric's death to the very end Buy a box of tissues  pick up this book  NOW!
I am 34 too old to be readg this series I read the first book because I liked the characters  enjoyed the plot I don't have any me excuses f readg these books I read a lot as a child  I would have enjoyed  these sties much me then Yet the series is good enough that   contues to hold my terest The wrg is predictable now but the  sty still remas a surprise  there was only one event  #4 HP   the goblet of fire which I had predicted So overall I was very pleased  wh the book  thk  is great  these sties hold the terest of  any children I heard the sty would be much darker than the others   that was not  true However the end of the sty suggests why future  books may be darker But cleary Rowlg is wrg to delight not to  scare
In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire we once aga meet wh our friends Harry Ron Hermione  the entire cast of unfgetable characters which make these books so special  In this book  is Year 4 at Hogwarts   the event of the year is the huge wizardg tournament beg hosted by  Hogwarts between   two of s rival wizardg schools the first such  competion  over 100 years  While each school is to have only one  representative  that student must be 17  older somehow Harry is  entered as the FOURTH champion of the year-long event  To top matters off   appears that Ld Voldemt is tryg once aga to rise  take his  place as the dark ld  How did Harry get entered to the tournament?  What means will Voldemt use to exact his revenge?  Who does one trust?  All told this latest book of Rowlg's is me of a mystery  less of a  fantasy than her previous Potter books  She admirably manages to convey  the growg matury of Harry Ron  Hermione - you can believe that they  are 14  not the 11 years olds started  the igal book  The double  meang behd the new characters names is still there   is fun to see  how the character will evolve to f his/her name  However I found this  book to be far darker than the previous ones - I would not feel comftable  givg  to a 9 year old to read  The fal climatic battle is tense   disturbg  Perhaps the most disappotg aspect of the book f me  was that the endg was less of completion  me of a harbger of what  is to come  the next book  While each of the previous books did ht  about what to expect  the next each had a very satisfyg conclusion  It is clear that we are beg prepared f a gr fal battle between  good  evil  And who is servg on which side has yet to be determed  On the posive side I enjoyed the numerous plot twists  I found this  book was able to draw me  completely I could not put  down until I  fished  Considerg the 700+ pages that is que an accomplishment  I  would recommend readg this book but only to a slightly older audience -  no one under 11 pleaset down until I  fished  Considerg the 700+ pages that is que an accomplishment  I  would recommend readg this book but only to a slightly older audience -  no one under 11 please
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best yet! The Suspence the Excement  the coldness of Ld Voldemt (shivvverr!) is me evident  this book than ever befe J K Rowlg's genius wrg has me  believg whout a doubt  the wizard wld  my fear of Ld Voldemt  has grown to another level OH! how  I want to jump to the book  help  Harry! You thought you were impatient to read Book 4!  Wa till you read  this! The wa f Book 5 is gog to be tturous!
As most of us remember this book was a long-waed addion to the Harry Potter saga  I myself was just chg to get my hs on a copy of one  well  was wth the wa!  This superb fourth book returns us to  JK Rowlg's tale about magic muggles  the famous school Hogwarts  Rowlg promised a darker sty  well she delivered  There is a  death of a Hogwarts student  teacher  the endg was so terryyg   parts so while readg  you fear f po Harry's safety  (Don't  wry there are three me books to come though)  I fished this   one day  was so grippg  I could not put  down until one-thirty  when I had fished   This was a marvelous book that is defely wth  a read  Trust me all the hype is well deserved!  I would recommend Harry  Potter  the Goblet of Fire to anyone- kids adults  doesn't matter  You'll love this book
As the books progress so does the diction  length of them If your young Muggle is lookg f a good read I say go wh Harry! You cannot do any wrong wh this outstg series by Ms Rawlg who really makes  anythg seem possible! Want to learn how to play Quiddch? Or how to cast  a spell? It's all here  this marvellous series a must f all children   maybe their parents too!
After wag months f the next Harry Potter Book Goblet of Fire is a disappotment  The paful deteriation of the characters clude:  Mr Weasley has taken to sayg &quotGOD&quot casually  the use of  &quotdamn&quot to punctuate the speech of the &quotGood Guys&quot  the  change from mischievous to &quotevil&quot to describe the Weasley tws'  grs  I cannot recommend this book as a  good one f grparents to  purchase f their loved ones
&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is one of my fave books After you fish   gives you a lot to thk about I thouroughly enjoyed every chapter But I wish someone didn't have to die Still this  book is really great- packed wh suspense excement  surprise This  book is just as good  not better than the other Harry Potter books I  can't wa f the 5th one to come out!
The first ltle b is kd of not cool f fans of HarrPotter who have read the other 3 books because  retells the pastcharacters  their relation  their personaly  everythg but once you get past that s SWEET!
If you loved the other three Harry Potter books you'll love this one even me The first few pages were confusg but they started to draw me to the magical wld of wizards as i'm sure they will f you too Harry goes  on many adventures wh his friends Ron Hermione  his other classmates   faculty
A great book! I loved all the magical mayhem  plot twists not to mention the new characters! Harry really gets to  wh this new book! Rowlg's best HP to date wh HP two comg  second! Can't wa f HP  5 to come out next year! But I found this book to be darker  dealg  wh me tense issues then the other three HP books I enjoyed the  action packed excement but thk the book should be rated f 12 years   upnot 9 years  up! To the parents out there you should read the  endg  see   would be appropriate f your younger kids because of  the blood-lettg decapation  resurrection of a dead bodyBut all   all I loved !
JK Rowlg has wrten a thrillg  volvg new Harry Potter book  I started readg the moment  arrived  could hardly bare to put  down until I had fished   It is the longest of all the Harry Potter books so far but the plot is much me volved  f the first time a  Harry Potter book does not end on a happy note  It has all the wonderful  magical elements of the first three Harry Potter books that made them so  engrossg plus me emotional drama than I have ever seen  a Harry  Potter book  I laughed  I cried  This book had a deeper effect on me  than any previous Harry Potter book  My first thought upon fishg the  novel washow will I survive until the 5th book is released!
once aga jk rowlg does a magnicent job all should read this book
I really enjoyed Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  It's terestg to see Harry Ron  Hermione gettg older  movg to adolescence  Their magical abilies are also maturg  The series defely took a turn to the me serious side of thgs wh this book  The characters all  ga me depth  you get to know them better  I enjoyed this a lot   am lookg fward to the next book
As Harry grows so do the sties  their depth  complexy  This may be a challengg read f younger readers wh some scary parts However modern kids have seen far wse on TV   the movies   should not have trouble dealg wh the me mature elements of the  styThe sty unfolds a b slowly  comparison to the other tales  but befe you know  you're stayg up late to fish   wrg  your review  Amazon when you should really be sleepg!I won't give  away any sty details  Grab a tch (flashlight)  hide under the  covers f another entrancg readCan I der book 5 now?

Ladies  Gentlemen this book is defely not just f kids The darkest book  the series yet Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire will enchant you  draw you  We see Harry at fourteen becomg me   me mature  gettg drawn  further  further by fces he cannot  control Fced to participate  a wizard tournament which many believe he  is capable of Harry overcomes new obstacles wh the help of his  friends old  new But this time Harry has a new enemy close to him  who will not rest until he is dead This book does not leave you wh the  emotional high the previous three did It has a &quothappy endg&quot  but the negative developments outweigh the posives  leave you wh a  keen sense of febodg  a thirst f me JK Rowlg wres to your  emotions  leaves you feelg as though you have been struck  the chest  wh a 734 page book Only the most talented of auths can direct your  feelgs wh their wds  Ms Rowlg is to be counted among the  greats Keep up the excellent wk
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is  yet another extrodenary book by J K Rowlg  We got  earlier today I haven't been able to put  down all day  It is just as wonderful as the other books wh wonderful charcacters  that make the wld of magic seem as real as ever  If you have read the  other Harry Potter book that you will surely want to put this one on your  list  even  you haven't  is a wonderful book f all children   Adults no matter what their age
J K Rowlg has created a suspensful  well crafted middle book  her Harry Potter series  The book is 734 pages long f a reason  There is me action than ever befe  this stallment we see the maturg  personalies of Harry Hermione  Ron  we ga excg new sights  to the mysterious pasts of Profess Dumblede Profess Snape   He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

Rowlgs has done  aga  She has made a book that is so excg  so sad ( so big) that  kept me readg f 10 straight hours  F those of you that want to know the full sty this is not the review to  read  I will give no spoilers  Harry potter  the Goblet of Fire  is to the first three Harry Potter books as The Ld of the Rgs is to the  hobb  While the first three books are excellent they are really just a  set up to troduce the wld  of Harry  The Goblet of Fire is Rowlgs  first Masterpeice  my opion  The Goblet of Fire has to do wh  The Triwizard Tournament where Hogwarts  two other wizard schools  Beauxbatons  Durmstrang compete f the Triwizard Cup  Voldemt  (sry)  his suppters play a much bigger role  this book than any of  the others  Overall this book has a darker feelg to   To put some  questions out of your md  1 Someone does die  this book 2 There  are dragons volved  this book 3 There is a quiddch wld cup  this  book 4 Harry does have a maj crush on Cho  this book  If this  book is any dication of what is to come from Rowlgs There are at least  three books to look fward to  I will defately be first  le f 5  6  7

I never was a big fan  of readg  once the Harry Potter books came out I was so to  Thank  You JK Rowlg f creatg the wonderful characters
I don't want to give away too much of the plot but this is an excellent book Goes much deeper to the long runng style of Voldemt  his dark followers  the battle of good vs evil It's wonderful also to see how the characters we all love (Harry Hermione  Ron) are growg  up  developg to strong brave young adults while still retag  their own distct personalies This character development is truly  impressive  the Auth is a cred to her craft This book is a ltle  b me mature readg than the previous 3 - a ltle scarier at times  (You-Know-Who is a pretty scary fellow) - but after readg all 735 pages   one day I'm left wantg the next book even me than I was droolg  over this one Be warned: the endg is surprisg  the clfhanger  endg of open questions  this one is far me juicy than the last 3  books 
Does this book really need a review?  I blasted through the pages barely able to put  down  JK Rowlg has done  aga  The plot thickens as the Dark One once aga attacks Harry  I can't say me whout givg  away me of the plot  But CONSTANT VIGILANCE  motherly love save Harry  f Book 5  Please don't let  be as long between books
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was defately wth wag f It's a must read f anyone who loves fantasy wh a ltle twist of mystery If you haven't already bought  make sure you do because 's a great book!
Harry Potter  his friends sce aga  their  quest f wizardry  justice  Rowlg's wonderfully rich characters span the generations of her readers  create believeable well-developed habants of her wld In  this book we see a much me mature Harry  wness the delight   hr of a teenager comg of ageThe plot holds together well f a  700+ page book  ought to keep even the most cynical Muggle reader  enchanted by 
JK Rowlg has outdone herself this time  This 700 page sequel to the first three Harry Potter books is the first sequel that I thk outdoes the igal  After books two  three came out I still throught book one  was the best  But now wh book four I have changed my md!  This book  is great!  Everyone should take the time to read !  Every page will make  you laugh gasp cry  move you to the edge of your seat  Defately  darker than the first three this Harry Potter has me attude  is  me suspenceful than any one befe  Reccomended f all ages!
The 4th Book is very very terestg  although JKRowlg said the end was very frighteng I thought that  was not as frighteng as the 2nd  3rd The endg surprised even me I was misled by some Harry  Potter se about what would happen I thk that  was made terestg  by beg so long (752 pages) JKRowlg could expla everythg   detail I just can't wa f the next book to come out  Befe you read  the 4th you must read the 1st 2nd &amp 3rd  you might be a ltle  confused  Check the cover f hts about the book Mary Grpre has  hidden them very well
I thk this is one of JK Rowlgs best books ever  I thk  is the best book even to wa f  I truly love 
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  is one of the best books I have ever read In this sty Harry fds out me about his past He also fds out  about Voldemt the dreaded wizard I fished this book the day I got   I have read the three other Harry Potter books not just once but eleven  times but this book out does them all I love readg  was delighted  when we bought Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire My younger sister was  very upset that I got to read the book first She is still very mad that  she got to start  after me My mother is also  le to read ! I  thoughly enjoy readg the Harry Potter books  can't wa f J K  Rowlg to fish wrg the next three books  the series Harry Potter   the Goblet of fire is a must read  was wth the wa!
The 4th Harry Potter book is amazg!  It starts off wh adream that harry has  then is drts off to when he ends up wakgup from this dream wh his scar hurtg  When his scar hurts somethg about You-Know-Who comes around  He goes on amazg thgs like the Quiddch Wld Cup that the Weaslys take him to  Choas also comes out  this book when fightg of wizards to the muggles emerges  IN the other books around the 7th  8th chapter Harry is probably at hogwarts wh he new term  Well  this book he gets to Hogwarts  the 12th chapter because JK Rowlg has fally figured  the book is longer then she could put me details  awesome adventures  the book  Belive me you got to buy this book  It probably will be suable f people  the 6th grade through adults because the vocabulary is me hard to underst  there is me gruesome events  this book  Harry Pottter is one of the best series  book histy  Buy this book to release the magical wld cludg the new Defense Agast Dark Arts Teacher!
JK Rowlg delivers f the fourth time wh Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire The book lives up to the exceptional stards set fth  the first three books of the series We fd Harry preparg to enter his fourth year of Hogwarts (but not befe attendg the Quiddch Wld Cup)  The book is wonderfully wrten but not overly  simplistic The vocabulary is on a fairly adult level  Brish idioms   allusions abound Children however should have no problem gettg  through this 752 page epic -  can't be put down! I hope the next three  books  what the auth has dubbed a 7-part series come out soon as I will  be first  le
Beg an avid fan of the notious Harry Potter books I sat up most of yesterday devourg Our Hero's latest fay to the wld of Muggles magic  mayhem And to my delight JK Rowlg has once aga outdone herself The book is a gem: 's funny 's sad 's wonderful 's (dare I type ?) magicalConsiderg the enmous publicy surroundg the publication of this book the fourth of an anticipated seven book series I was a b wried that the book might fall sht of s credible build-up Never fear though because "Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire" is the best book of the series to date True s length may seem a b off-puttg but  moves briskly  the plot doesn't get as tangled  bogged down as parts of the third book didThe focus of the plot has shted too No longer relegated to beg mere character-establishg details the friendship  creasgly tricky relationships between Hermione Ron  Harry have become central parts of the book They  their Hogwarts classmates are growg up  the tone of the book reflects this sht  s emphasis on terpersonal relationships that are given every b as much weight  the sty as the characters' usual hijksPress repts were crect  statg that this book is the turng pot  the series the end of the novel sets the stage f the comg battle between good  evil but does  whout sacricg some of the characters' me ambiguous motives  choices And yes a character does die- but never I thk will the appeal of these terric books Brava Ms Rowlg! Long live Harry Potter the boy who lived!
The fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series was well wth the wa  I thought that the &quotromantic&quot feelgs of Harry Potter would be played up but  wasn't  It is just the right amount f young readers  who are about to reach adolescenceAll the fave ( not so  fave) characters are back as well as some new wizards  wches  It  was nice to see the Weasley's take a bigger role sce they have become a  surrogate family to HarryThe endg left several plot les open that  can only be answered  the last of the series  I can't wa f the fth  one
I stayed up longer than i should have to go to the book ste to purchase the 4th stallment to the harry potter sty  I battled screamg children  pushy mothers  i was a t that bookste f one hour untill  my hs grasped the book  &quotIt is sooo thick&quot i said as i  removed the drool from the cner of my mouth   had just started to ra  where I lived  i knew that on a Friday night  my college town the  roads would be trechous  I carefully placed the book  the passengers  seat  marveled at the people just walkg  to the bookste hopg to  grab a copy  &quotBders ran out&quot one said &quotThrere was a  stampede&quot said another  I smiled a b as i turned my ignion  By  the time I reached home i found that my roommates were outside of the  house  &quotWhere did you go?&quot  one asked me &quotto the  bookste&quot  &quotAt this hour?  What did you get&quot  i crged a  ltle knowg his responce to my decision not to go out to get a childrens  book would be  but i held my head up  said  &quotI got Harry  Potter! &quot  I am 21 years old  i have been readg sce I was four  And Harry Potter books are the best books that i have ever read Period
The best so far  the Harry Potter series! This book has everythg that made the other three books so great  memuch me JK Rowlg is at her best  this book It has danger action suspense adventure  even  a ltle romance I don't want to spoil the suprise but somethg happens  at the end of the sty that volves Harry Vodemt  someone you will  remember from the last book This is a book no one should miss!
I thk Harry Potter may well prove to be the fad diet of theNaughties: the moment I purchased &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet ofFire&quot at Barnes &amp Nobles' midnight party petty habs like eatg  sleepg were put on the back burner until the last page had been turned It's well known by now that Rowlg's prose draws you  (enchants you  you will)  the fourth stallment  the series is no exception Never have I had the pleasure to read a series that has gotten *consistently better* wh each sequel not until Harry Potter that is After stayg up far too late last night I stumbled out of bed  brought the newest book wh me to the gym drawg some terestg looks from the folks around me as I kept my eyes riveted to the pages stead of the treadmill readout My only regret is that I couldn't contue to read  when I did my laps  the pool!  =) Rest assured those who doubted that Rowlg has once aga surpassed herself Not sce Roald Dahl have I enjoyed so-called &quotchildren's books&quot so immensely Rowlg's dark sense of hum  knack f the fantastic remd me of such classics as &quotThe Wches&quot  &quotMatilda&quot faves of me sce I was a young'n But curse the woman f wrg so well --  takes me one day to read the books  a year f the next to come out! That's what rereadg is f though I suppose
The 4th Harry Potter book is great  The dference between this book  the other Harry Potter books is that  started the sty somewhere else stead of the Dursley's house  Unlike those  the other books this time Harry was to spend a part of his 14-year-old summer wh the Weasleys  But   turned out not as good as Harry hoped  In the book he had come face to  face wh the Dark ld aga  What's new however is that the Triwizard  Tournament was added to Harry's school le  I thk Harry  the fth  book was much wiser  In the previous books he just went right to the  problems whout thkg what might happen to him  But this time he  thought  over befe takg any actions  Knowg what his next task   the Tournament might be he went lookg f spells that would help him  We may say he was growg up  becomg mature  Like those  the others  books a lot of people still wry about Harry especially the Weasleys  The one me thg good about readg this 734-page bookis that the  sties are much clearer  me coherent  I just couldn't put  down  while readg  It always gets to the best part at the end of a chapter so  that  makes you want to fd out what happens next  I did  It took  me 6 hours to fish 
I thk that Harry Potter  the goblet of fire is one of the best books I am readg  is so great I hope that everyone will enjoy this book even parents But  you  never heard of this book  you want to read  you  need to go through the  whole series first because s much  better I am  lookg fward to the rest  JK Rowlgs next cg thg that  happens to the great  wizard HARRY POTTER!
This book was the best yet  If you haven't read the first three you should read those first
After the loooong wa s fally here! I just fished The Cup Of Fire  I was delighted wh ! JK Rowlg certiantly did not dissapot me I loved Wky Profess Moody  the Nters  the endg surprised  me I love the depth of all the characters I thk s wonderful how we  learned a ltle me about Neville   was great to see me of the  famous Sirius Black The repter was evil but defly added some  controversy I just cannot believe this book I enjoyed  so much!  Now  I can hardly wa f the next one )
Rowlg weaves her magic once aga!  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is another great read!  Auths who wre series  become immensely popular sometimes fall to a p of fmulaic wrg  Given the  credible hype prepaty to this book's release  the splash that  Rowlg has made around the wld  both children  adult books I was  concerned that this book couldn't possibly live up to 's press but  Rowlg proves herself to be a wizard of wds  The fourth Harry Potter  book is as rivetg as the first  I found the book spellbdg from the  first page to the last  I'm already lookg fward to the next book
The new Harry Potter book was a dissapotment Half the bookwas unneeded potlessIt was way too evil  sister I thkthat JK Rowlg should have kept  md who her audience was  what they would have enjoyed when she wrote the bookI would have preferred a few me upltg scenes rather than all the wicked  sister ones This book makes JK Rowlg look bad  casts a dark shadow on the previous  future books
The first three Harry Potter books were excellent pieces of lerature that kept me glued to their pages until I had fished  The fourth was no dferent  This book was nothg sht of amazg  While the ma body  was about ( such a wd can be used) equal to the others surpassg them  slightly the endg was nothg sht of spectacular  Rowlg has me  entranced completely  Until the fth one comes out I will be on the edge  of my seat wag wh bated breath  As f a b me detail  I will  not give away any plot however temptg  may be  Suffice  to say that  the entirety of the sty is entrancg  I spent 8 hours straight readg   until I was done  The last chapters are not so much an endg but are  as the tle of the last chapter implies a begng  It is as  Rowlg  cluded a few chapters from the next book at the end of this one to make  sure that speculation about the next will spread until the fth book's  release Buy this book as soon as you can  It will vanish stantly once  the people who fish  first tell others about   If you have not read  the others go out  buy all four  It's no use wag until they come  out  paperback that may never happen at the rate they will sell  Don't  let a treasure like this pass you by  Get   read   try not to  go sane wag f the next  All  all kudos to Rowlg!  Thank you  f makg this wonderful wld  sharg  all wh us!
I consider &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot defately the best &quotHarry Potter&quot book that has yet been published  If you read  liked the other &quotHarry Potter&quot books readg this book  is a must  Though  may seem to start off a b slow  is just buildg  up to the sky-rocket at the end of the book  If you didn't stay up till  midnight the mng of the 8th of July to buy this book DON'T MAKE THAT  MISTAKE AGAIN!
I really love this book even   is a ltle bg  the begng the endg makes up f   also sets up the next book perfectly  I can't wa till  comes out  This book has the perfect settg  is a  thrillg read  I would reccommend  to any person of any age The fact  that  volves wchcraft does not make this book  any way evil but  only better The characters are so vivid  is almost like watchg a  movie It is still a mystery book as much as fantasy which would also make   a good adult read even   is me child iented
Rowlg still has her magic  this 734 pager probably the pivotal book  the series  The sty defely becomes darker (there are a few deaths) as she has warned  would  because of this  s length  one might want to hesate befe readg  to the very young (5  6  years old)  However  is still a wonderful book  Rowlg pulls off  another completely unexpected endg  I will not give specics as to the  plot - I will leave  f you to read but I will say that Rowlg does  beg to wer to the realm of love/hmones  does so rather  successfully  Overall I would highly recommend  to anyone who read  the first three - I fished  wh a day of gettg   Oh  you  might want to look at the English version at amazoncouk - the cover is  much better
This book is the best out of the series! Everyone was right about  beg darker but  certaly was good Ltle kids might thk twice about readg  some of the thgs that happened concerng Ld Voldemt  Wmtail are gruesome They were wrong about  beg 752 pages 's 734  The book was so good I read   a day And I re-read the end aga   aga  aga! I can't wa f the fth to come out I'll pay whatever  price necessary to get  the DAY  comes out I was really exced when I  read the part about LV (the pot thg)  the Death Eaters especially  the parts wh Albus Dumblede He  Harry are my fav characters
It was the best book of the series plus  took me than a day f me to read 
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  The latest  the Harry Potter series is far longer than the previous books  deals wh me grown-up issues of death love  betrayal  There is the usual hi-jks of Harry  the  gang agast Draco Malfoy  his gang but the ma event of this book is  not the usual terhouse Quiddch match  is the me dangerous  TriWizard Tournement consistg of 3 champions from 3 dferent wizardry  schools all competg  3 dferent tasks wh the wner takg home 1000  Galleons  Harry also has other thgs on his md thkg about Cho  Chang from Ravenclaw  realizg that she's me than just a really good  Quiddch player  We learn me about the Dark Arts   He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named  I don't want to spoil anythg f anybody so I  am just gog to say that the latest Harry Potter was wth the wa   now I can't wa f the 5th one to see where the next adventure takes us!  I thk that wh all the hype everyone  his brother will be readg  this book   lives up to the hype!**Pa
JK Rowlg has done  aga! Here I am thkg that the third book (Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban) is the best book  the series when I discover Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is even better!  In  this book the first chapter draws you  because  cludes Wmtail  (the rat/human also known as Scabbers/Peter Pettigrew)  the Riddles The  followg is contaed  the first two pages so do not email me sayg I  am revealg a crucial part of the plotle: I did not underst how Tom  Riddle could have been murdured wh his parents  a Muggle village  because didn't Tom (Marvolo) Riddle's father leave his mother because he  found  out his we was a wch? And didn't Tom live  a Muggle phanage   grow up to be Ld Voldemt? This will be explaed  the end  Anyway Harry  is ved to stay wh the Weasleys f the rest of the  summer  der to go wh them to the Quddch Wld Cup (Irel vs  Bulgaria)  they stay at a campground wh numerous other wizards who do  not have a clue as to what a real campse looks like  where a crowd of  death eaters (suppters of the Dark Ld) have gathered to bewch some  Muggle owners of the campground When Harry Ron  Hermionie are sent  to the woods by Mr Weasley while the mistry representatives attempt to  calm everythg down a skull wh the tounge of a snake appears-causg  screams of fear from the crowd watchg the death eaters-f this is the  dark mark the sign of Voldemt By the way the Dursleys allow Harry to  go due to the fact that Harry's godfather is an escaped murdurer Harry  then travels wh the Weasleys to Kg's Cross  a MUGGLE TAXI (humous  thg) When they arrive at school they meet their new Defense agast the  dark arts teacher &quotMad-Eye&quot Moody who has a magical glass eye   does not like Draco Malfoy There is no Quddch due to the fact that  the Triwizard Tnament is beg held this year a tournament between 3  schools Hogwarts Beauxmont an ele French school  Dumstrunda  school from Bulgaria known f s teachgs of the Dark Arts  Whoever's  name is pulled from the Goblet of Fire must compete  f Harry Potter   his name is pulled from the cup  could mean deathen 3  schools Hogwarts Beauxmont an ele French school  Dumstrunda  school from Bulgaria known f s teachgs of the Dark Arts  Whoever's  name is pulled from the Goblet of Fire must compete  f Harry Potter   his name is pulled from the cup  could mean death
This book is AWESOME!  I just fished Chapter 20  only stopped because my eyes are so tired I was seeg double  Harry  friends  just as good as  the first three (even better at some places)  there are lots of new friends/enemies to keep thgs hoppg!  This book is well wth the  time put to   Rowlg has a way of wrg that keeps the sty  rollg  the character's terestg  detailed  My only question:  When is #5 comg?
To quote an advertisement I heard somewhere: &quotyou can't improve on perfection But you can equal &quot So  is wh Harry Potter It is surely the greatest series I've ever read  number four Harry Potter   the Goblet of Fire is well up to stards It was brilliant as were  the other three  I've been dyg to get my hs on  ever sce I  fished HP  the prisoner of Azkaban I fd that the series is  maturg along wh me  's great to be growg wh Harry- I've also  just fished the fourth fm so I feel like I know him much better than  Nancy Drew f example who's been eighteen sce my mother was readg  the books! I won't reveal the plot I once read a book review somewhere  that told me the end of the second book  I was maaaaaadbut I'll tell  you this-  f some reason you haven't dered the latest stallment  then ORDER IT NOW!
On a ray Saturday mng  July our phone rang &quotThere's an owl  your front yard&quotclaimed our neighb We raced to the wdow  spied  on our pch: the lusciously thick Harry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire The Star Wars video was turned off The computer game was aboned  The book I was readg was set aside We all met  the livg room even  the cats I read aloud of course no one was willg to go through the  agony of takg turns They stared wh hungry eyes as I read junkies  gettg their fix at last: my 8 year old daughter my 10 year old son my  44 year old husb We read four chapters the first day So far we're  spellbound
Beyond excellant this book is completely enchantg From the moment I picked  up to the moment I fished  I was grippg the edge of my seat readg faster  faster  an attempt to discover what happens  Never has a Harry Potter book been this thrillg  I am a big fan of  the first three books so you know that is not an unfounded statement Kids  AND adults I know have been beggg me to let them read parts of the book:  they are all impatiently awag the arrival of their own copy I can't  remember the last time I was so deeply entrenched  a series: I am already  gog crazy wh anticipation f the next book If possible I would give  this book a 10-star review
Harry Potter  the Goblet of fire is an awsome book theendg is really excellent  this book beats the other three  theseries hs downIt is a must read f all fantasy fans of all ages
In the fourth book  the Harry Potter saga Rowlg remas just as captivatg as ever Furtherme this is the largest of the books to date  should keep you  s spell f a long time to come
While this latest stallment  the Harry Potter saga is very good  is not que as good as the first three books  the series f several reasons  First this book starts out pretty slowly Harry doesn't even arrive at Hogwarts until page 170  Second while we meet many new  characters they are mostly one-dimensional  Ms Rowlg also gave several  characters accents that I found distractg  Third most of the action   this book takes place wh the last 100 pages  Harry  his friends  spend too much time wryg  planng  not enough time dog  anythg  That said this book is defely wth readg  Like  the  first three books there are all sts of plot twists  surprises to make  thgs terestg  This book is a ltle scarier than the others   everythg is not resolved at the end Instead the reader is left hangg   wag f book five
As an adult I thoughly enjoyed this book but I am a ltle concerned about some children readg this book It was a b darker  much me frighteng then the previous books I found the descriptions much me  vivid  while I enjoyed them  might scare younger children That beg  said I couldn't put  down  Not to give anythg away but I love how  Harry  company are growg up  facg thgs that real teenagers  contend wh I cannot wa f the next book
After I first read book 4 of this very popular series I was AMAZED how much detail can be put to 1 book! Durg the whole book I was kept  captive my the emense detail  col of Rowlg's 4th novel  just  could not put  down f a second This book will capture your terest   heart from the moment you pick  up till the moment you fish the  last  then you'll want to pick  up  start the adventure once me  I would reccomend this book to people of all ages  although some have  crizied  I cannot fd a reason through out the book that would want  make me put  down much less denounce !
Wow! i read this book  i loved ! (f the most part anyways) i couldn't put  down  the plot was very clever  terestg (though  dragged  a few parts) the book was defly darker  scarier but   still retaed the charm that was  the first 3  J K Rowlg has this  knack of leadg you to believe one thg  twistg  all around  i  had no clue as to who was dyg until the end  wonderfuly done!
There is very ltle to be said about this book Harry Potter is wonderful  J K Rowlg deserves all the success this series is generatg This book which I have only just fished is even better than s  predecesss  was wth all the hype  has received Good luck to  Bloomsbury  keepg the tle  plot of the next one secret Now that  children have rediscovered readg lets hope they keep readg  other  children's auths take their rightful place along side those who wre  adult fiction Children's books can be lerature   would appear that  people are begng to recognise that fact Move over Mike: I Want to be  Like Harry
The latest Harry Potter book has been surrounded wh a lot of hype  meetg the expectations built up over the precedg weeks would be hard f any novel  But Rowlg's fourth has done exactly that--the Goblet of  Fire is simultaneously fast-paced packed wh the trademark sly hum   sometimes excrutiatgly on the mark about the &quotusual pangs of  adolescence&quot  It is darker than other Potter books filled wh me  implied responsibily--the styles seem to be growg up wh Harry  One small complat--very small--is that toward the end the majy of  the wrg is purely exposy  However the length of the book (roughly  three times the size of the first book) is not a negative  It's me of a  gt  After hours of readg the book all you can do is smile
As eagerly as we have all waed f this book I was tempted to read  slowly  sav  but I couldn't  Rowlg contues the magic she has displayed  the first three novels but this time on a larger scope  You get the feelg from the very first chapter that she has cast her net a b  wider this time but her control over this magical wld is still complete  There are me characters than ever befe  a bigger view of the  wizardg wld but the tale still revolves as ever around Harry Potter  He is growg up braver me sarcastic (his friend Ron is also far me  sarcastic - he probably picked  up from Fred  Gege) but still as  likable as ever  All the rums you've heard are true - 's scarier  you see the Quiddich Wld Cup (Rowlg may have taken the fan behavi  from English soccer matches!) Harry gets terested  girls (although a  G-rated terest)  someone dies  No hts here but when  happens   will be nearly impossible not to feel great sadness at this event  although as Harry you might have to wa until you can catch your breath  befe  sks   Rowlg's new characters are all vivid creations  even  some seem underused (there are promises some will be back)  many  romantic hts are given which I hope will be played out  future novels  The mystery is me complex than that of the third book  you never  know whom to trust  The fal confrontation is the most tense yet   leads to many trigug possibilies f book five  So where is the  le  where do I get  ?
this book is a greatly wrten book  I hope to see me from JK Rowlg
&quotWow&quot That was the one wd I could get out after fishg  fally closg the covers of the massive  long-awaed &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot It was everythg I've been eagerly  wag f  *me*  not just because of s hefty 734-page length  I *won't* summarize the plot here  my review--there are just too many  delights shocks  surprises that you should discover yourself This is  by far the most volved detailed  most of all *dark* Harry Potter  novel--Harry's le becomes far me complicated wh friendship problems  romantic dficulties  far me deadly threats to his le   happess than ever befe But don't be put off: there's as much of the  usual fun silless  delight to JK Rowlg's wonderful wrg that  defely had me laughg out loud even  some of the darker moments  Rowlg has planned the general structure of her entire seven-book saga  befeh   shows  the care  attention to details that pick up  plotles  characters from previous books (Tom Riddle Dobby the  House-Elf Sirius Black)  take them  dramatic  excg directions  as well as addg novative twists  startlg new characters rangg  from the frighteng to the humous As great as the first books were  Book Four is me mature me volved  me personal She has wh  this book taken the Harry Potter saga halfway through s full  seven-volume sty  I found myself thkg of another fave saga:  conceived as a sgle structure but broken to parts that captured the  imagations  hearts of kids  adults around the wld: The &quotStar  Wars&quot movies And what is generally considered the best of all the  Star Wars movies?--the *middle* one &quotThe Empire Strikes Back&quot  On the 20th anniversary of that my fave Star Wars movie I sat   read the new Harry Potter halfway through Harry's saga  was amazed at  how much  remded me of &quotEmpire&quot not specically  plot but  rather  theme At the end of both &quotHarry IV&quot   &quotEmpire&quot the villa has shown himself to be me powerful than  imaged our heroes have suffered a serious blow  dark dark times are  comg We know they'll triumphbut half the fun is accompanyg them on  their adventures We know how  all wked out f Luke Skywalker I  can't wa to see how  will come out f Harry Potter I'm already  countg the days until Book Five but  the meantime I thk I'll read  Books One through Four all over aga Harry Potter is not likely to look  back on his fourth year at Hogwart's will much fondnessbut I  his  millions of fans *will*t remded me of &quotEmpire&quot not specically  plot but  rather  theme At the end of both &quotHarry IV&quot   &quotEmpire&quot the villa has shown himself to be me powerful than  imaged our heroes have suffered a serious blow  dark dark times are  comg We know they'll triumphbut half the fun is accompanyg them on  their adventures We know how  all wked out f Luke Skywalker I  can't wa to see how  will come out f Harry Potter I'm already  countg the days until Book Five but  the meantime I thk I'll read  Books One through Four all over aga Harry Potter is not likely to look  back on his fourth year at Hogwart's will much fondnessbut I  his  millions of fans *will*
The fourth Harry Potter adventure starts off a b slowly ( at 752 pages the whole books could use a b of edg) but the sty once  starts was grippg enough that I read the whole book  a day  New  characters are troduced the clever plot twists contue  some of the  ongog characters develop terestg depths  I don't want to say any  me f fear of givg the plot away except that I'm wag f Harry  Potter 5 &ltg&gt
This is a good fourth book - despe  beg 700+ pages  There's magic mayhem  murder  terestg plot twists f which the books are famous  Honestly the book could have been shter by about half but the  wrg  ventive magic  monsters will keep you entertaed  It  leaves much me of a 'clfhanger' endg than the first three but you'll  have to buy  to fd out what He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is up to this  time
JK Rowlg is a truly talented wrer Wh such an imagation she can have people of all ages stg on the edge of their chair wag to fd out what will happen next  her books Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire  has you on edge from the first five pages You will even consider skippg  a few pages just so you can fd out what will happen next The book is  even better because Harry is a ltle me mature because of his 14 years  of age even starts to have terest  a special girl! The suprise  awas yous a perfect gt f you anyone that you thk would  enjoy thrills  laughs
Like most of you enthusiastic Potter fans out there  the Muggle wld I had been wag wh a certa amount of fear  trepidation f the publication of Rowlg's newest stallment Would she match the  imagative genius of her first three books  would the mountg  expectation prove to be too much pressure f her delicate wrer's  muse?Fear no me fellow Muggles Harry Potter is back  he is  better than ever befeRowlg has managed yet aga to exce us wh  wonderful new wizard ventions  ideas wh a host of new charms  curses  magical creatures F the Quiddch fans among you there is a  Quiddch specatular at the begng of the book  f those of you who  love the mysterious plot twists  turns prepare to be as baffled as ever  befe As usual the clues are all there but I thk  would take the  combed fces of Miss Marple Hercule Poirot  Sherlock Holmes to  discover this book's particular evil-doer befe the appoted  timeHowever on a me serious note &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is  darker than the previous books not because of any scarier monsters (I  still tremble when I thk of the Basilisk  those Spider creatures   the last one) but because of the general tone of the book  the growth   understg of our young heroes  heroes The full hr of the past  is revealed to our friends  as maturg wizards  wches they beg  to take on the srow  the responsibily of adulthood  a wld where  evil keeps us all on our guardTruly this book is the &quotEmpire  Strikes Back&quot of the Potter series  as such  shows enmous  bravery  depth Rarely do we see such creative genius especially  the  wld of children's lerature where we mostly fd questions answered   fear assuaged when really those fears  those questions are what push us  all fward to thought action  responsibiltyA challengg  thrillg imagative thought-provokg book from one of the wld's most  excg livg wrersgative thought-provokg book from one of the wld's most  excg livg wrers

Harry Ron  Hermione are prepared f the most excg event of the year-the International Quiddch Cup But dark magic happengs after the tournament feshadow events that turn Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts to  a time of suspicion  wry Harry is unwtgly drawn to the  TriWizard Tournament  ultimately is competg f his le As wh  previous books  this series the plot moves fast  seamlessly The sty  is terspersed wh touches of both true hum as well the occasional  stance of juvenile hum Rowlg's young characters grapple wh issues  rangg from first crushes to the ethical treatment of other creatures The  last 100 pages of the book are tense  disturbg Parents may wish to  pre-read this book  provide guidance  reassurance to young fans as  Harry experiences true evil  s grim effects  The ongog theme of  good agast evil is expled me fully than  the previous books Harry  is begng to learn some unpleasant realies about human nature Harry  must cope wh the idea that even those on the side of good may have  unpleasant character tras cludg mal weakness lack of fesight  cowardice prejudice  action simply to mata the status quo The  reader gas sights to the motives  histy of many fave  characters at Hogwarts cludg Neville Longbottom Hagrid Profess  Snape  Albus Dumblede Although immediate problems are resolved at  the end the reader is left hangg wh the knowledge that me trouble is  sure to come --  countg the days until the next book!
Yesterday mng July 8 I went to my local bookseller  snatched up the second to last copy of &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot  I immediately began readg  then  would have read  straight  through had not other circumstances tervened  I did fish  last  night   my opion this is the best book  the series yet  Harry  is me grown up (he's even terested  girls!)  his challenges are  growg steadily stronger  Add to this the Quiddch Wld Cup two new  wizardg schools: Durmstrang  Beauxbatons (whose headmistress Madame  Maxime is as big as Hagrid!)  a large dose of Voldemt  you have  one of the best books you'll read all year!PS  Dobby is back!
I stayed up late to buy this book  then spent half the night  almost ALL of the day readg   My eyes are tired but I couldn't wa to wre my review of this terric book!  Harry is a year older  his adventures keep on comg!  I don't know what to say as to not ru the  plot but I will say that I am already lookig fward to the fth  stallment of Harry's le at Hogwarts Aga Rowlg demonstrates her  genius wh another book full of thrills (over 700 pages wth! )   memable characters
I would like to review this book  but I'll be careful not to ru any surprises I was completely blown away by the time I reached the end of this book I am an avid reader of  fantasy  sci-fi booksAlthough I am  sixteen  the Harry Potter books often were a b below my readg level  I have  enjoyed them immensely However this book seemed very dferent to  me than the previous ones This book is much scarier  darker sce the  villians really take no prisoners (well one you'll see)  the book  starts  ends wh the deathes of protagonists I knew at least one  character from a previous book was doomed to die from an terview I saw on  TV but I was still not prepared  The twist at the end (there is one   all of the books) is the best so far not so far-fetched as the one at the  end of book 3 but enough to astonish even me though I was searchg f  clues the entire time But there is one thg that I feel will turn off  many younger readers that is because the villa achieves most of  his/her's goals However  just makes me want to read the next one even  me Despe that this book is over 700 pages I fished   half the  time of the other ones I couldn't put  down (I bought  a 8 am this  mng  fished  at 2 pm) JK Rowlg really took a dferent  approach to this book  I loved  This is the best Harry Potter book  yet
To quote from the character Profess Trelawney  &quotHarry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot this stallment  the Harry Potter series is &quotgreater  me terrible&quot than the three which came befe    It's fabulously wrten  totally captivatg 's also que a b  darker  less nocent than the precedg three sties  Harry now 14  years old is enjoyg the prospect of gog back to Hogwarts f his  fourth year after he Ron  Hermione get to go wh Ron's family to see  the Quiddch Wld Cup  Among the the school year highlights are a  special competion wh students from rival wizardg schools a new  Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher wh a strangely powerful eye   the common problems which assail adolescents -- even magical ones  Prepare  yourself f me hum  magic old  new friends  enemies  surprisg twists  a b of gut-wrenchg shock  When I fally  fished the book my hs were lerally shakg from the thrill  Once  aga JK Rowlg takes us on a fantastic broomstick ride through the  wld of the beloved underage wizard Harry Potter
A Classic just like the other potter books equally enjoyable f kids  adults
After months of anticipation Harry Potter Day arrived Like the past 3 books I could not put this one down From the openg page- to the fal wd I was entranced Every chapter brought a new twist  turn f Harry   his friends &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot answered  many questions that I had (from past books)  left me wh new ones It  made me laugh  made me cry This is defately a book (series) f all  ages
First I was one of those obsessed people who waed at midnight f the release of this book  I started readg around 9 AM the next mng  fished about 10:45 at night  (Granted I did take ltle lunch   dner breaks)  But  goes whout sayg I haven't read f 12 hours on  one book like this ever befe  Unbelievable~ that's the wd that  comes to md after fally fishg this book  The book starts  wh a scene at the Riddle house (Remember Voldemt is Tom Riddle) This   self was dferent because I have gotten  used to the books startg  at the Dursley's wh Harry over the summer  Harry is not actually even   chapter one  After this the book gets gog a ltle me though I  considered the first eight chapters to be only so-so  F me the book  really started feelg like a real Harry Potter book when Harry went back  to Hogwarts  chapter 11  At this pot the book really picks up the  pace  by now you simply cannot put the book down!  I thk that sce   so many ways this book was very dferent from her others I liked when  Hogwarts started aga because  was a chunk of &quotnmal&quot HP  books f me to hold on to  The book is very complex  obviously  well thought out as always  Interestg names like Karkaroff   creatures called veela appear  Harry Hermione  Ron have grown up a  ltle  are 14 now  I couldn't tear myself away from the book because  I defely liked   However the book was some scary parts near the  end particularily the part where the person &quotreaders will care  about&quot dies  This part upset me because the book's readg level says  8-12 years old yet some 8  9 year olds would be defely scared by  some parts  Lastly about the person who does  this book: (I won't  tell who  was)  JK did a good job even wh this because she took a  character you would have just felt bad  you knew  was this person yet  by the end of the sty you felt absolutely terrible that this wonderful  person had been killed  She managed to make  feel like a close friend  had died  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was defely a  pivotal novel  this series  And  was great a way most dferent  from other novels  The tensy is high  while some questions do get  answered this book left me wh many me questions than answers!  She  ends the book keepg the reader completely hooked f the next onery you felt absolutely terrible that this wonderful  person had been killed  She managed to make  feel like a close friend  had died  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was defely a  pivotal novel  this series  And  was great a way most dferent  from other novels  The tensy is high  while some questions do get  answered this book left me wh many me questions than answers!  She  ends the book keepg the reader completely hooked f the next one
I received my copy of this book yesterday  stayed up until 2 AM readg   I lerally could NOT put  down!  The plot twists  turns like a roller coaster there is never a dull moment  this sty  the  characters are so real  the descriptions so vivid that you feel like  you're stg there watchg the book happen right  front of you  JK  Rowlg's wrg gets stronger  me sure-hed wh each book   &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is proof of this  It's the  best one yet!
My we daughter  I bought 3 books at 12:01 AM on July 8th so we each could have one to read at our leisure  My we  I scribed: &quotWe love you&quot to our 9-year-old daughter's book We cannot return that  book because we wrote   but the other 2 are gog backThe first  three books had an acceptable balance of trigue  hum Book 4 is  offensive  certaly is not f children I can't read book 4 to my  daughterWe are very disappoted I hope book 5 is better
I just fished readg the Goblet of Fire  really enjoyed   It is a &quotdarker&quot sty than the others me serious  many parts  But  was very enjoyable when talkg about the Wld Quiddich Match many  of the classes  the tournement  I would recommend this book to anyone  who enjoyed the first three but warn parents that younger children may be  disturbed by some of the scarier parts
Arrived this mng have read NON STOP sce then  The detail  descriptions are wonderful  The sty keeps you readg on 'till the end!  I can not encourage EVERYONE to read this series wh enough enthusiasm  AWSOME BOOK!  Can I pre-der #5 now?
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was a great read  Although  was near 800 pages the book was hard to put down f even a mute  Rowlgs has put out another book that children  adults will both enjoy   share  This time as always Harry Potter's adventure was very  entertag  the Rowlgs was able to clude many sub-plots that were  equally terestg The new book has only improved on the Potter series   though  may answer new questions about what Harry Potter can  accomplish as a wizard  also brgs new mysteries to thk about Who are  his real friends?  Who is the enemy? Will he  his frds escape once  aga unharmed?  Will they ever fd a Defense Agast the Dark Arts  teacher?  Adults will enjoy this book as they have the first three  Children will enjoy the book as well although sometimes I wonder  they  will become frightened at some themes especially younger children wh the  theme of death  However I do not fd the book appropriate  any  capacy  even themes of death  hatred can be hled by young  children as long as thier parents supervise  I recommend this book to  anyone wh  imagation  cannot wa until Book 5
&quotThis book was great!&quot That's all I'l say f now as that really sums  up  not to give away the plot of course  JkRowlg Thank you once agaYours a fan
I liked the fourth book even better than the first three Draco Malfoy was meaner than ever I really liked the Wld Cup Quiddch match  the TriWizard Tournament though I missed the terhouse quiddch matches You  see me of Sirius Black  his role is terestg I can't wa f the  fth book!
Rowlg's fourth book  her series of Harry Potter promises to be as smashg a success as the first three &quotGoblet of Fire&quot though much lengthier than s precedents at 734 pages weaves a captivatg plot  wh enough side-sties to mata the trigue  build suspense but  not distract Apart from the fact that her characters are magical Rowlg  ptrays the teenage Harry Ron  Hermione as real  flawed 'people'  that will appeal to their young readers A surprisg turn near the end of  the novel promises an abrupt but pleasg change of direction f the next  three Harry Potter books to come --  is an enjoyable read  well wth  the time of any age group!
JK Rowlg creates another credible good read f adults  children alike  The reader will not be disapoted
In the fourth  so called pivotal book  the Harry Potter series his summer is troubled by dreams of the evil wizard voldemt  All this happens just befe an unexpected vation to the quiddch cup the  biggest spts tournament  the wld  After the tournament he goes back  to hogwarts  learns of a special event happeng there which makes this  his most exicg  eventful year yet at hogwarts  As  all the other  Rowlg books I liked this book because the book really makes you connect  wh the characters  It has great description  is terestg from  begng till the end  I highly recommend readg this book  may be  the best yet  the Harry Potter series
This has to be the best  the series JK Rowlg wked very hard this past year creatg an outstg 4th addion to Mr Potter's adventures It is long book but wrten well  easily read She remds the reader of past fmation which refreshes your memy  helps you stay wh the  sty I thoughly enjoyed the book I spent the WHOLE day  Harry's  wld  loved every mute of !
It has been a wonderful experience readg this book  This book troduced a very trestg set of characters  leaves me wonderg will Harry ever have the same Defence Agast the Dark Arts teacher two  years  a row  Another thk I particularly liked about the book is how  she answered some of the pressg unanswered questions  Is  Her-mi-o-nee  Granger  Her-me-own It is faly answered  the book  I Thk this is  JK Rowlg's best yet
The 5th Harry Potter book still captures the excement  fun But I thought the book was a b longer than neccessary The events also dragged a b ButHarry is still the best! This time Harry seems to have grown  up a b The book was very excg  some parts  other parts were  very funny Hee Hee Loads of new characters were put to this book   You-Know-Who makes a moveoops can't say anymeGo Read The Book! IT  IS REALLY GOOD I love all the Harry books although I still like the first  one the best I was really sad when I fished readg the book *snf  snf* I can't wa until the next book!
Once aga Rowlg presents us wh the adventures of the amazg Harry Potter I'm gog to refra from givg away any of the plot but suffice  to say the plot has just gotten thicker Harry hasn't only matured but  so has the sty carryg multi-plot les me trigue me mysteries   me suspectsMy first impression was that this book ceases to be a  children's book but rather a tale f the many adult readers who have been  fdg themselves enraptured wh Rowlgs wrgs This is not to say of  course that this book can't be read by children  still has the ease  of verse  language which Potter fans have come to appreciate Rather  the sty is engagg enough to please the me mature readers out  thereThis 700+ page tome left me entralled I could hardly put the  book down And sce fishg  I have already reread several chapters  aga just to catch as many details as I possibly couldRowlg better  get crackg there are gog to be millions of fans anticipatg the  next book as this one leaves you wantg me  me Potter's universe  is expg  what a way f  to grow Do not hesate to buy this  book  you love a good sty but I recommend walkg through the whole  series first Regardless whether this is your first Potter book  just the  latest  your collection I suspect you will fd yourself taken by this  young man  his amazg adventures
If you were as exicted as I was to get book 4 you might be a ltle b disapionted First off there  is the volume of the book self You can't help thkg &quotDoes  really need to be that long?&quot  Second  as Ms Rowlg told us  is very &quotdark&quot Just f example the  book starts out wh some one dyg Beg how old I am this does not  bother  me But to a 6 year old child  might be very disturbg Plus  thats not what we expect from any Harry Potter book At least I want a fun   easy read that takes my md to a magical wld not a book that has a  deep under-currant of death  Third there were those times that Harry just  had the answer hed to him You wanted at least Hermione to figure  out   then tell him  But I must say 's Harry Potter The Wrg   details are wonderful The plot  sty are the best yet And as always  JK Rowls abilaty to thk left   go right is un-matched
This enchantg book fourth  the Harry Potter series wrten by JK Rowlg becomes me thrillg  spellboundg than the first three Despe the astoundg length (752 pages) readers young  old will  surely read this book nonstop as they are bewched by the thrill   creativy It's a wild ride all through the book I bought myself a copy  (havg read the first three numerous times)  couldn't stop readg  until I read the last wd of the book You'll become hooked too Goblet  of Fire is wth me then 5 stars
Well here  is! The fourth stallment of the beloved Harry Potter series! Many of us have but one question on our md so when's the next one comg out? This thrillg novel of romance mystery  adventure is  a page-turner from page 1 to 800 Though an exceptionally long sty JK  Rowlg carefully placed each detail leavg not one strg untied Rums  were plentul upon the release of this book but I will answer one f you  There is a death The rest you must fd out f yourself  Severalhmemotional changes occur f the characters  this book   one may have even found true love Hey 's possible! Fally a villian  pretendg to be a friend surfaces  leads Harry right towell read   fd out! Also a friend  foe of Harry make several apperances A  fabulous sty of love mystery adventure  growg up  the  fascatg wld of Harry Potter
Some people say the Harry Potter books are f kids Nonsense They are f anyone who enjoys great plottg dry w  characters you can truly care about &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is longer than  most adult books yet kids  adults alike can't wa to read   Amazoncom was nice enough to FedEx my copy to me yesterday July 8  I  fished  befe bedtime pausg after every chapter to let what had  transpired sk  I laughed out loud I wried along wh Harry about  the safety of his friends And I even adm to a tear  my eye at one  pot Isn't that what a great book is supposed to do -- take you on an  imagative ride that's outside the sphere of your nmal le? That's what  this book did f me  will probably do f anyone who doesn't judge a  book by the age range that some reviewers attach to  Crics carp that  the Harry Potter hype has overshadowed the books themselves Nonsense  Don't read Harry Potter because the media tells you to read  because   has charm  joy  hum  everythg that makes le so wonderful!
I adm I was a b wried Wh all the buildup  hype  so fth f the release of the 4th stallment  the Harry Potter series I dreaded that the book wouldn't measure up that all the excement would be f  nothg But the brilliant JK Rowlg has done  aga- wh a book  that  my opion is the best  the series so far   In this book  Harry sees the Quiddch Wld Cup discovers girls is entered  a st  of spell duel meets some new friends  foes becomes farther  then  closer to his friend Ron  once aga has a brush wh well  You-Know-Who but I won't give  all away   After hungrily devourg  over 700 pages of glious fiction  about 4 hours I was left wh a gr  on my face a feelg of triumph f Harry  a pang that told me the  book was over  that alas I would have to wa a while f the  sequel  Thank you JK Rowlg! What a wonderful magical phenomenon you  have created
Even though I have not completely fished Ms Rowlg's latest addion to her wonderful Harry  Potter series I must say that from what I have read thus far this book is absolutely marvelous It's defely another  page turner Wrg this review has been one of the few times I have put  this book down Rowlg defely does have the touch of a great wizard  It's almost as  she's created a spell to entrance her readers to  expg their imagations wh her purely genious books I don't want  to give anythg away but I can assure you that  your hopg that this  book is just as excg as all three of the previous addions to the  Harry Potter series you will not be disappoted Harry Potter rules!
My son who is 9 years old got his copy of the book today at 10:00 am  I had to fce him to stop readg tonight at 9:00 pm  He is enthralled wh the book as he was wh the other three!  He is already on page 400!   I had doubted the wisdom of a 700 + page children's book but my son is  already hopg that the next book will be 1000 pages ( will be out  soon! )Thanks f a great book f my children (I bought the cassettes  f my 6 year old daughter who can't que read the books yet)!  My husb  is wag  le f the book (he'll probably get  tomrow when my son  fishes !)
Though I've fished the book my head is still at Hogwarts  I'm contually amazed at Rowlg's stytellg her character development  the plot twists that keep you on the edge of your broomstick  Harry   his friends have another year of potions  carg f magical animals  while learng how to be ternational ambassds of sts  And  throughout Rowlg sees f to remd us that Harry  his friends are  human -  are subject to the pas of growg up  - even some dficult  lessons It's clear that this book is most imptant  the plot which  lks all the books  And I'm almost sry I've fished - as I now have to  wa f the rest of the Harry Potter saga  Rowlg has a fresh voice that  leaves a classic impression on you
Fally s here! Harry's next adventure! This book like the others has many twist  turns  is sure to keep you at the edge of your seat The first chapter starts off wh You- Know- Who  Wmtail plottg their  next move There will be the Quiddch Wld Cup- an excg chapter that  will have you cheerg f your favoure team Changes will take place at  Hogwarts that may affect everyone! And as Ms Rowlg promised someone  that everyone likes will die which will change the lives of the wches   wizards at Hogwarts Will You-Know-Who rise aga? Who will die? And  will Harry fall  love wh Hermione?  Get the book to fd out
First -- a couple facts: I will be 26  a few weeks we pre-dered  FEBRUARY  yes I waed at the wdow  RAN to the FedEx driver (thank you Amazon!) I have bookmarks  &quotGone Wh the Wd&quot  &quotWishsong of Shanara&quot -- but I spent Saturday afternoon   Sunday mng at Hogwarts  I was not disappoted! The characters  (most) have grown wh the series  although I like Quiddich I liked  the break from  I don't want to spoil  f anyone -- but let's just  say that I've been readg daily f me than 20 years now  the endg  still got me! :) Enjoy  -- I defely did!
It was great to see Harry back aga!
CALLING ALL MUGGLES! I thk that this is another shg addion to the already very popular &quotHarry Potter Series&quot Harry has all new adventures at Hogwarts   has MANY delightful moments  But then  aga NO book is whout s not so delightful ones   This book is full  of le from the very first page all the way to the 734th I would recomend  this book to ANYONE who likes to read ANYTHING because I believe this book  is one of the best I have ever read! Be prepared f a great time readg  this book This book is really fantastic 5 STARS!
Of course the eagerly awaed Harry Potter #4 had a great deal of hype to live up to Okay that's an understatement --  had an INSANE amount of hype to live up to But have no fear my fellow Harry Potter aficionados  THIS BOOK IS GREAT I'm a speed reader  I te through this like you  wouldn't believe  I haven't left my house all day after buyg the book  at midnight at a late night Harry Potter party at a bookste  San  Francisco The length was dauntg but by no means surmountable  I  was glad  was so longthe other Potter books ended WAY too soon f me  to really sav them There are some amazg twists but there's no way I'm  gog to spoil  (I hate reviews like that!) so I'm gog to end my  review so I can start to read  aga!
Rowlg has wrten a me ambious book than her previous three  Her villians are as evil as ever but many &quotgood guys&quot (particularly  the Mistry of Magic) are not as pearly whe as they seemedThis  book starts wh Harry Potter spendg the summer wh his Aunt Petunia  Uncle Vernon  cous Dudley Dursley  The Weasleys ve him to the  Wld Quiddch Cup game  strange  dangerous thgs start  happengOnce aga Voldemt maneuvers to improve his tenuous grasp  on le  to defeat Harry --  he has no qualms about who he'll kill to  ga his endsHarry meanwhile not only has to contend wh classes  competion  girls he fds that Ron  Hermione are not mere  sidekicks he can expect to suppt him unthkglyAdd the usual  Hogwarts faculty (cludg yet another Defence Agast the Dark Arts  teacher) students from two other (!) schools of magic  you have a tale  that propels you from page 1 to 734
This book was by far the most thought provokg piece of art by Jk Rowlg Harry Potter has matured  learns many terestg thgs Watch as he meets new people  how he deals wh them =-)
I've been eagerly awag the release of Harry Potter IV f months  Needless to say I was thrilled wh the news that  had arrived by Amazon delivery on the day of s release  6  7 hours after openg  I had  fished  The Goblet of Fire was equally as captivatg as the  previous three  not me so  I was on edge the entire read tryg  to decide who was lyg who was evil  who was gog to save the day  (other than Harry of course)  Wh each book Rowlg pats a clearer  picture of her wld  the characters wh   My only problem is  this:  What am I gog to do until Harry Potter V is released?
JK Rowlg has done  aga!  Havg spent the past 26 hours non-stop readg Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was one of the most compellg books I have ever read There is nothg rushed about this book  nothg  cut sht Her new characters are delightful The end is non-stop excg  How her books get better  better is proof that she is a gt to  ourselves  our children The smartest parents will share this experience  wh their children I have already pre-dered book Number 5
The new Harry Potter book is excellent! It is a very terestg plot wh a lot of mystery behd  THe endg is a complete surprise  leads the way to an excellent new book!
I liked the fourth book even better than the first three Draco Malfoy was meaner than ever I really liked the Wld Cup Quiddch match  the TriWizard Tournament though I missed the terhouse quiddch matches You  see me of Sirius Black  his role is terestg I can't wa f the  fth book!
This is a GREAT followup to the Prisoner of Azkaban! I am very very pleased wh this book
Just fished the book Once aga Ms Rowlg has done a wonderful job enchantg the reader wh her wds  sty The hype  praise given to her are very much deserved A must read f young  old alike
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best In here Harry is  his fourth year  has many new adventures wh his friends! I really love this book!
Stayg up all night to read this book was wth  If you haven't purchased  yet please do It's the best one  the series do far! Hats off the Mrs Rowlg!
The first thg that i noticed about this book is the size At630 pages long a childrens book is unusual to say the least! So is really a tribute to JKRowlg that she can hold our imagations that long f hold them she did The book is about Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts  Harry is trapped to beg the school champion: competg  the Triwizard Tournament under-age  which many wizards have died What follows is another excg sequel There were some new characters: Ra Skeeter Mad-eye Moody  Wky the house-elf among others Widely known as the one where someone dies  Harry discovers girls the death when  comes is hardly the terrible event that many were afraid of (although the book is me serious  tone than the others)  girls do not particularly feature:  is not at all soppy  left me eagerly awag the sequel
Wow  anyone hasn't alredy read this magnicent book then please you don't know what you're misg  I loved the 1st  2nd  3rd  now I truly love the fourth  It is the most best  the four ( f me ) I love the  book so badly I just hope the book goes on  on fever
As the first review this probably means I already fished  (which is true)  I must say when the crics said  was very 'dark'- yeah right!  It's a b serious  slow movg f younger readers  but overall JK Rowlg's &quotHarry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire&quot is a 'must  reader'
Harry Potter returns better than ever!  From the Quiddch Wld Cup to the Triwizard tournament to his showdown wh you know who Harry is as amazg as ever!  But what was the best was watchg him grow up another  year I can't wa f the next  next  next
We've all been delighted befe by the young wizard named Harry Potter JK Rowlg's books are very entertag  leave the reader wh a deep sense of satisfaction The fourth book which I eagerly awaed  sat  down to read the moment  arrived has outperfmed all my expectations  I absolutely loved !  I didn't move from the couch durg the whole time   took to read the book Harry's escapades were thrillg  I was taken  completely by surprise at the endg I thk everyone should read these  books because they're absolutely wonderful I wish I could wre that  well
A fantastic chapter  the HP saga  Wth every mute of the wa  Lots of surprises  shocks!  Do yourself a fav  start readg  today
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter book yet!  I just fished  (I got  at 12:00 last night)  let me tell you that you'll be glad that the book is over 700 pages long because every page is imptant to the sty  THE BEST ONE YET!
This book lived up to all the other harry potter novels  It might have been the best one This book should be a classic  JK Rowlg did a very good job wh 
JK Rowlg did an excellent job wrg Harry Potter  theGoblet of Fire the fourth book of the Harry Potter series This booktakes you on a magic carpet ride through your imagation Every page is filled wh a new magically excg event makg you not want to put  down!You won't be able to wa to fd out what happens to Harry  his friends at Hogwarts School of Wizardry this year There is a darker plot throughout as a even me ambious you-know-who goes after Harry There is me suspense emotion  danger  this book than the previous three of the series If you haven't read the first three don't wry you won't be lost because JK Rowlg weaves  previous events to the sty le so you can jump right ! (But of course after readg this you'll defately want to read the other ones! ) This is an excellent read f anyone  everyone wh an imagation
The book is perfect bound stead of the sewn structure used on the earlier books  the series Shame on the publisher f takg the cheap route Considerg they knew  was gog to sell a zillion copies they  could have made a qualy product Even  many of their customers would  not know the dference Harry Leve  Scholastic could have done a good  bdg because  was the right thg to do The first three books are  nicely produced I was impressed that they were of better qualy than the  brish versions This knew one makes me sad I look fward to the sty  I just hope the book doesn't fall apart on us There are four people  our  family who will read 
It was wonderful Really a surprise But i though  was a good surprise A totally awsome book
What can I say about such an overly hyped book as this?  Only that is was well wth the wa!  F all of you who have never read any of the Potter books (could there really be people who haven't read at least one?) thk  of these books as a series of magical mysteriesIt's le as usual f  Harry at the begng of the book which has him spendg yet another  dreadful summer wh his hateful guardians the Dursleys  (Image Dudley  Dursley on a diet!  Try sayg that 3 times fast)  Thgs pick up when  Harry goes to the Quiddich Wld Cup wh the Weasleys  And le at  Hogwarts is as terestg ( occasionally dangerous) as always wh 's  oddball asstment of students  professs  Naturally there is a new  Defense Agast the Dark Arts teacher (my but they do keep gog through  them don't they?)  Along the way we will learn about other schools like  Hogwarts ('s about time!)  And a new villa -  should I say  villaess - is troduced Someone who defately keeps Harry on his toes  All the while Harry  his 2 best friends Ron  Hermione become  entangled wh the mystery of The Goblet of FireWh characteristic  abon Rowlg creates familiar  busy backdrop f Harry  friends as  she pushes him through a series of terryg encounters the usual  mischief  mayhem new revelations ( of course rousg games of  Quiddch)It's delightful to see how Rowlg can stay true to the feel  of the previous books  yet allow Harry  friends to mature (ex: As  the kids are officially teenagers now hmones will kick  f Harry Ron   Hermione but they all fall  love wh the wrong people!  Harry  especially has some dficulties  this area)Be prepared: this is a  darker book than the first 3  Some well known characters die -- one of  whom is well liked by readers  The endg of the book is frighteng  compaired to the previos books but is a necessary evil f Harry as the  older he gets the me he learns about his past  JK Rowlg has stated  that each new book gets progressively darker so as to  tie  wh the  overall plotAs always she wres wh a deft touch  This deliciously  suspenseful novel is every b as grippg  imagative as the previous  books -- full of unexpected twists  turns  A delight to be saved  especially you are like me already awag the next oneolder he gets the me he learns about his past  JK Rowlg has stated  that each new book gets progressively darker so as to  tie  wh the  overall plotAs always she wres wh a deft touch  This deliciously  suspenseful novel is every b as grippg  imagative as the previous  books -- full of unexpected twists  turns  A delight to be saved  especially you are like me already awag the next one
Well what can I say? This is my fave of the four Harry Potter books Kudos to JK Rowlg She has yet aga proved that Harry Potter will never get old Just like the other three this book is full of wonderfull wizardry  plenty of potions My friends this is one great book All I  know that is  you have [the money] you must buy this book   you don't  take a loan I give my guarantee that you will like this book  you're a  Harry Potter fan   will highten your hunger f book number five!
I remember when I thought I wouldnt like Harry Potter last year  boy was I wrong These books are very good f ray days  on well any day These books HARRY POTTER gets your imagionation gog You thk what  these books are based on real le  could this really happen? Well these  answers are easyly answered No they cant really happen  they arnt based  on real le The Harry Potter books are full of palm-sweatg adventure   is deffetly a fantasy Harry Potter ( you thk about ) really  dose have a mal  might be a non-(::hesatates::)imptant but there is  one there Some people might thk of this book a bad thg (parent are  cluded f this) They have their own opion to what they read  have  their child read My personal opionion is that these books help the  imagation grow  are a speration f some people(cludg me)  Theref these books are a great key to the md  we owe  all to  JK Rowlg

As a first review on a book I have discovered that this isn't as easy as  seems but here goes! Beg the fourth book  the series Harry Potter &amp The Goblet Of Fire had a lot to live up to what wh all the previous adventures at Hogwarts gag wld fame  captivatg  audiences of all ages I found only beg 13 that the book had a  confusg start which revealed self as the sty went on Although this  book is about as long as all the other three put together  kept me just  as terested nonetheless  There were as usual many dferent styles  to follow but they all connected  some way  [A]s my ratg f this book shows this  is an amazg book!
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire defely lives up Harry's ( JK Rowlg's) name  While  is a tad slow  startg the book is unflaggg  s adventure suspense  mystery  My one crisim:  Rowlg does less wh details  the day-to-day le of Hogwarts  students  I guess this would become bg now that we're familiar wh  the settg but I found  hard to believe that an entire school year had  passed f Harry when I reached the end of the book  Readers beware  however:  you thought there was suspense after book 3  a rush f  book 4 then book 5 is gog to create a stampede  The 4th stallment  does to the Harry Potter Series what The Empire Strikes Back did to Star  Wars  It presents a great triumph yet this triumph is dimmed by grim  defeat  I almost wish that I had not completed this book  the six hours   took me because now I have another long year of anxious wag ahead  of me
The 4th Harry Potter book is the best  the series  adds a new excg sty to the Harry Potter books  I would recomend this book to anyone regardless of age
JK Rowlg has done  aga Usually sequels that have this much hype attached  are as eargerlly awaed as this one tend to dissapot When anticipations are this high no matter how wonderful the sty they can never que live up to our expectationsBut not this timeJK Rowlg  manages to escape the curse of the three-time-bestseller  not churn out  lazily wrten drivel meant only to slake the hunger of the masses  make  me money as quickly as possible regardless of qualy Instead she  delivers an enchantg  engrossg enstallment  the saga that has  captured the hearts of children  adults all of the wld Wh well  ptrayed characters flowg descriptions  the entertagly  suspensful plots f which she is famous &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot is  well wth the waAll  all  is a stunng read brgg all  the imagation  vivid deatail that we've come to expect Despe s  length  is sure to be enjoyed by even the most reluctant readers Don't  be suprised to fd your children still awake well past there bedtimes  readg under the covers wh a flashlight You would too
This book is the fourth  the Harry Potter series It is easily the best of the lot However  is probably too tense f the younger readers that have enjoyed the earlier books I would not recommend  f any child  under the age of ten Older children are  f a genue treat It is well  paced wh the mixture of adventure suspense  whimsy that  characterized the earlier books The size of the book 734 pages is less  of a problem than might be expected Nothg is wasted  this book there  is no lerary fat The size is actually nice as  simply means less time  spent between fishg this book  wag f the next one to be  published

I don't dare give anythg away as this book is too new but I stayed up all night to read   I'm glad I did  J K Rowlg has packed even me perilous adventure  spe tglg spells to this latest bookIt  was defately me volved than the last three tles but wth every  mute I spent readg 
I was able to get my hs on a copy of book 4 about two weeks ago thanks to some people I know  the book busessHere are some of the reasons I did not like the book:1  I thought book 4 lacked the imagation  of the previous books2  I felt the qualy of content  book 4 was  poTo me qualy of content meansgivg your  readers your best efft  A good example is book 1  you felt you were there observg everythg  I  did not get this feelg from book 43 I felt the stickabily fact was  very low  To me stickabily is the power to get you volved wh a  character  the book  Even tho the qualy is very low I like the fact  that this book will get kids to shut off their computers  other  electronic time killers encourage them to read the 700plus pages  Please  remember to pass your copy of the book to your friends  loved ones   donate  to your school library when your done wh   Your library will  be able to share the book wh students unable to buy the book
Well not que havg fished the long-awaed fourth stallment  the Harry Potter series (I'm on page 583) I wanted to share my veiws of the book so farIt is my opion that Rowlg is gettg a ltle me  confident  you will wh her wrg  So far I have counted six swear  wds (all the same one I thk) which may not seem like much but f a  book beg read by seven-year-olds  's me than I would have thoughtIt seems that Rowlg's jokes are gettg fewer  father between but  funnier  F stance the Malfoy/ferret scene which I absolutely loved   have read time after time after time  after time  also I loved  the way Fred asked Angela to go to the ball wh him: &quotOy Angela!  D'ya wanna go to the ball wh me?&quot  I laughed out loud f almost a  whole muteAlthough the begng was a ltle b -- darker -- wh  Frank  Wmtail  Voldemt I liked the new trodution  And I  loved the endg sentence to the first chapter  However I do have yet to  fish the whole book maybe when I do I will post another reveiwAll   all so far I loved this book  am now eagerly awag the fth one  (boy I just hale these thgs ) so I would recommend   general  but 's darker than the ones befe a ltle scarier  I would say   isn't f anyone under say eight  ne
I thought that this book was the best book yet! I would read aga ANY day!  And I will probably read  aga! I was justcaptured  the book  I couldnt put  down
The goblet of fire is the best of the Harry Potter books yet It's filled wh secrets  me Harry's ever wonderful adventures These books not only encourage children to read but also iate the md to be creative   thk This book is just as entertag as the previous 3  even  though this book hasn't been out f me than a day I'm already anxiously  awag the next one
When I first picked this book up I was sceptical to fd out 's magic would rema  I was also concerned about the content Ithought  would be to childish at first I am pleased to say that I was completely wrong  This book is great f all ages because the depth is not hard to underst  but rather terestg truigg  does not allow you to put  down  This book ventures onto new grounds by showg Harry's terests as he grows older ie he is developg an terest  girls  is also startg to go about thgs me maturely than befe This book like 's elders brgs the wld of magic wizardry  down right funGET THE BOOK!
It's great!Kids will love  once they start to read It's awhole new adventure wh RonHermonie of cource HarryOnce youstart you can't stop!
Okay so I realize that 's a book f every year Harry is at Hogwarts but  would have been nice  this one could have been spl to two - 's just too longDon't get me wrong 's still a very good book but  I just don't see myself rushg to pick  up aga any time soon which I  do frequently wh the other 3  the series  And that's really why this  is only 4 stars stead of 5Igng the length how is the book?  Very  good: the characters all grow their relationships become me complex   the wld they live  becomes darker  deeper just as  does  real  le  We get a better look at the global wld of wizards  wches  (although some of the accents are a ltle ridiculous)  there is a me  palpable sense of evil  this bookAre there any complats?  Sure but  there's always gog to be a few  JK Rowlg seems to be perg to new  readers by explag previous events ad nauseum which means that there's  ltle pot  buyg the previous novels  you read Goblet of Fire  first  And the death that was so well hypedwell no spoilers but I  image there will be a few shrugs from adults as to the victimTo  fish 's a great read (maybe not 12am to 6:15am great but that's my  fault!) that would have benefed from tighter sty tellg  And   that's the only complat then 's wth your time  money
The Harry Potter books just keep gettg better  better It is longer (700 some pages) but that just means that  lasts longer It is darker yes  some people may fd that disturbg as well as the death of a  certa character but fans will still fd this an enjoyable read  will  eagerly awa the next book I know I am
VERY GOOD!  I got  at 12 midnight last night  read  all day Just got done wh  GREAT BOOK! All the secrets  rumours were true Not ALL of them SOME of them GREAT BOOK The best of JK Rowlg's wk yet!  This book got me hooked all day  night! I reccomend this to die-hard-HP  fans like myself  I cant wa f book 5!
The latest  Harry Potter's magical adventures has defelylived up to ( surpassed) s expectations  Like s threepredecesss 's a book that you just can't put down  Although  is the longest Potter book yet at 752 pages each page is packed wh terestg  imagative dialogue characters  suations  In Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire Harry  his fellow-fourth years become me terested  romances that sometimes cause conflict Harry's still wary of You-Know-Who tryg to be on guard at all times  These wries are compounded when his scar begs to throb aga  someone makes the "Dark Mark" wh Harry's w-the sign of Voldemt!  But once Harry gets back to Hogwarts there's too many other thgs f Harry to concentrate on-the usual class load Profess Snape's constant watch  of course his crush on a certa female Quiddch playerThen there's the huge wizardg event that will take place at Hogwarts f the first time  years! Harry tries to stay out of the limelight but is soon unwillgly  mysteriously thrown to the spotlight- to perilous danger And then of course are the hilarious antics of the Weasley tws the adventures of Harry  his two best friends Ron  Hermione Neville Longbottom's klutzy catastrophes the tauntg from Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy  the other reasons why JK Rowlg's books are so successful  The new characters that appear  Book 4 are just as crazy  unique as all of the others  Some of the new characters come to play as Harry's view of the wizardg wld exps  he  his friends meet wizards from other countries  Like the other Harry Potters Goblet of Fire is a must-read!
If all the Potter books keep gettg better like this we'll have to give the first book less stars!  Harry returns f his fourth year at Hogwarts  he's settg publishg recds like crazy!  He's on every news channel!  Anyway  the book Harry fds love  learns about other  wizardg schools  Who is the new defense agast the dark arts teacher?  The longest  best yet  The number of pages won't stop you from readg    an hour  The pages really fly  now I am gog to e-mail  amazoncom  ask them  they know when the fth book comes out!  Well you better read this book now   have the best read EVER! 1
I picked the book up last night a few mutes past midnight  have just put  down after almost ne straight hours of readg 's the best of the four books so far!JK Rowlg has done  aga wh the same  great characters (along wh some new ones)  a sty that you won't want  to put downIf you're a fan of Harry Potter this is one book you don't  want to delay  pickg up!
I teach nth grade English  Michigan  my students are stir crazy over Harry Potter  Yay to Rowlg f a nice thick book f summertime readg!  It's a must read f me too--one of the perks of my job!
Well OK I stayed up all night to read   I had a great time  Many moments made me laugh out loud  It is much darker than the previous three books - Harry's fourth year at school is not as fun as the pri three but Rowlg is  full fm  The stycraftg is magnicent  the way the  characters from the pri books return is que entertag  It's great  to see that Rowlg has not succumbed to the commercialism  You can tell  she's wrg the way she wants to which makes the book all the me  enjoyable
Harry Potter returns better than ever!  From the Quiddch Wld Cup to the Triwizard tournament to his showdown wh you know who Harry is as amazg as ever!  But what was the best was watchg him grow up another  year I can't wa f the next  next  next
As a 23-year-old medical student let me first assure anyone who isn't aware of  yet that Harry Potter is most certaly not just f kids  As an avid reader sce early childhood I'm thrilled to see lots of  people--children particularly--fally gettg exced about readg   certaly this is a book wth gettg exced about  The characters the  plot the settgs--all are extradarily richly drawn  thoughly  engrossg  What I fd particularly appealg about this book is the  credible emotional range which  covers  From a near-slapstick scene  featurg the Weasleys  the Dursleys to the death of one central  character the book covers a huge amount of ground  does  wh  remarkable credibily  Havg The Goblet of Fire all  the first day   was available I will now be awag the fth book  the series f what  will no doubt seem far too long a time
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the newest  best yet  the series  Detailg Harry's 4th year at Hogwarts all kds of surprises wa you:  magical curses msyterious men  the mystical Triwizard  TournamentAnd a death
The miracle goes on! Mrs Rowlg defeats TV aga! (of course probably  the near future we'll start seeg Harry Potter TV animations  teractive CD roms  movies  stuff But f now the igal Potter version tended f READING -  usg our mds- is far better the best  experience!) I was ftunate enough to have this 4th book  my hs as  soon as  was possible! And I just did fish  a few mutes ago  Well I won't spoil anyone's fun  I won't say a wd on the surprises  cluded  there And second I don't know  I'll be the first person  sayg this but I'M ALREADY EAGERLY WAITING THE FIFTH POTTER BOOK! Go  f those Gobblets! You'll feel alive  happier  me magical than  ever!Thanks Mrs Rowlg! God bless you  Harry!Carlos Sicilia  csicilia@cantvnet From Caracas Venezuela
A truly splendid book filled wh adventures  shockg excements I Read the book f ten hours straight   was not at all tedious One of the best books f both children  adults Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a book that is amazg  also a book that everyone should read!
This book was scarier then the other 3  Contrary to what JK has said only one person dies  I personally don`t really care about him  :)  F those of you who have already fished this book I feel that Fudge is  me concerned wh keepg his job than wh the welfare of the wizardg  communy
Rowlg did a superb job wh wrg this book  I just fished  at 7 PM New Yk time  I got  at midnight  It is a b scary at times  has terestg twists  Like the Weasleys arrivg at the Dursleys boarded  up fireplace  Harry meetg one of the Stars of the latest Quiddch  Wld Cup at school  I thk that the length of this book doesn't matter  at all  You might want to read  twice because there's a lot of odd  names that are hard to keep track of  the book  A superb book!  Read !  But read the series  der  It helps
thk you've been wag 4-EVER (! ) to get your copy of Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire?  well the wa is over the book is fally here AND BOY IS IT WORTH IT!  jo Harry Hermoe Ron  others f another magical tale  the series the bottom le is: 's big 's good   you won't see the sun till your done!
As always Harry returns f another year at Hogwarts Befe that he viss the Weasleys who are always amusg where they go to the Quiddch Wld Cup At the match me than a tournament takes place wh some dark  mishappgs on the camp grounds The whole year is filled wh new  characters some friends &amp some enemys Two other schools vis  -der to go to the Triwizard Tournament there are some very trestg  personalies At the Yule Christmas Ball you will be VERY surprised the  person Harry takes is probably NO ONE you would expect The death of a  character is very dark but the person was NOT a maj player Voldemt  suddenly re-arrises from the dead  almost back to power wh the help of  one only known as Wmtail This year is NOTHING like the previous I was  so enraptured wh the book that when I got  I HAD to read  cover to  cover Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a very impressive JK  Rowlg has outdone herself constantly wh each book I am lookg fward  to what will happen next  the Harry Potter series
The countdown is over  I'm happy to say that Book 4  the Harry Potter saga was wth every day of the wa Harry's growg up  so are Ron  Hermione (I fally learned how to pronounce her name--I'd been readg  wrong)I don't want to give anythg away so I'll just  mention that the plot contas the usual set of surprisg twists wh the  addion of a healthy dose of romantic terest as Harry Ron   Hermione (not to mention Hagrid) start to really notice the oppose  gender Like &quotPrisoner of Azkaban&quot &quotGoblet of Fire&quot  contas remders that the wizardg wld is dangerous scary-- often  unfair  that not everyone is playg f the same team-- is even  playg the same game I did start to wonder towards the end how Harry   his friends ever found time to do any actual wk (well besides  Hermione) wh all of their sneakg around the castle late at night  The Dursleys are as vile as ever the Weasley's as much fun    general &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot is like walkg  to a roomful of old friends  spendg hours (several at 700+ pages)  catchg up on what everyone's been dog My only question now is: when  will Book 5 be out?
I got a copy of this book early  though I haven't fished readg  I can honestly say  is an amazg book juat as magical as the past books! If you still haven't fallen  love wh Harry Potter you are  missg out! I suppose you COULD read this book  you haven't read the  others but 's best to be familiarized wh Harry's wld This book  warng is DARKER than  the rest but 's still full of the charm that  makes this series so special!
 I could'nt wa my neighb owns a small bookste  I got a copy at 12:01 AM - is now 07:02  I have just fished just fished all 734 pages  I am 14 years old  believe this series captures  the imagations of children  adults because  never talks down to  them IT IS ACTUALLY FUN TO READ! Harry Potter rules!
I waed all night  f a midnight copy of this eagerly awaed next stallment Began readg soon as I got home COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN This is the best yet  the Potter series The characters are becomg really real f me  Rowlg is dog a really good job of  makg them slowly grow up This is NOT the Baby-ster's Club Harry is  gettg older  facg new thgs here There is slightly me violence   this book than  the other ones but  ties  so well wh the sty  I'm almost tempted to call  necessary violence I would read  to a  sensive child but maybe while keepg the lights on There is also a  healthy amount of the wonderful Rowlg hum here  the fun  the  sheer happess of beg a kid wizard It's not all about the hr BUY  IT BUY IT :)
this 4th book of the harry potter series is the best of all i thk everybody should read this ook ecause  is so excg
This Book Is The Best One out of ALL of the Harry Potter books  I can't believe the suspense  thrill of what's hidg around the cner  &quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of Fire&quot os a recommended book by  everyone that has  is readg the series
I'm one of those adults who was caught by the Harry Potter phenomenon  However I wasn't sure  all the Hype over Book IV was gog to be wth   Well after neglectg other thgs  der to read this weighty  book I only have one question- when is book 5 comg out?  Throughout  the 700  some pages Rowlg brgs us the characterization suspense   hum that readers have come to expect but wh a darker tone than the  previous books  New characters such as Vikt Krum  Fleur Delacour open  up new wdows to Rowlg's wld  Ra Skeeter is a wonderful  commentary on the &quotany length to get a sty&quot attude of the  media  The return of Sirius Black  meetg Bill Weasley (the 'cool'  Weasley) were only some of the thrills that kept me up late last night  The mountg tension towards the end of the book was enough to keep me fm  that thirty page paper due  two days  A masterpiece by Rowlg  the  best so far
This is terric book wh a great sty plot Its size will keep kids readg though the summer  get back on track It is one of the best books I've ever read
EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS!  I thk the threebefe &quotGoblet of Fire&quot were fast-paced  que simplythe best books I have ever read  This new book is no exception  The 734 pages make f me fantastic details surprises  me readg of this fabulous series  A lot of new characters are troduced as well as your fave old ones  the excement  mystery is still there creatg an atmosphere unequaled  book histy  There is a new idea a tournament wh other wizardg schools which of course provides me ways f adventure f Harry  his pals  The climax is startlg  there are numerous surprise endgs like  all Harry Potter books  Harry even starts to discover girls   you like Quiddch the Quiddch Wld Cup chapter is smack around the start of the book  I got this book at midnight at a bookste  started this mng  Only takg a few shts breaks I read the afternoon away  I could not put  down  just fished   Now I can't wa f the fth one!  To all Harry Potter fans buy the book If you've never read Harry Potter get out of your cave  buy this book as to not miss the best series  the entire wld  I can't really give my real ratg because the largeness of the number would take up to much space  Just do yourself the biggest fav possible  BUY &quotHARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE&quot!

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is me mysterious than the others not to mention the fact that  has 700-somethg pages! You have to get used to all the changes throughout the book because there are plenty of  new characters! I wish Lup were  this book It seems lonely whout  him The only thg bad compared to the Scerer's Stone the Chamber of  Secrets  the Prisoner of Askanban is that there is no Quiddch at  Hogwarts
This is a great book! It starts out a b slow but soon thereis tons of excement!   I reccomend this bbook f all ages because  is excgeasy to read  is very vivid Enjoy!
This book is an amazg piece of lerature!  Make sure you buy  there is a reason why  has sold well over a million copies   keeps sellg!  Don't be skeptical about buyg  just do !  Have fun   enjoy the book as much as i did  am!
This book was by far the most amazg Harry Potter book yet! JK Rowlgs wonderful wrtg style kept me enthralled thoughout the entire book!  I loved   I recommend  to anyone who liked the first three! (And anyone else f that matter!)

Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is the best book on Earthbut  i keep wrg I might give away the whole plot  The book is not exactly 752 pgs long 's 734pgs Buy this book s wth the money  you're a Harry  Potter fan And  you never read a Harry Potter book then you should start  wh the first
I Loved this book! It is my all time fave! The plot is so enamg  excg The only part I don't like is that 's too scary But  is wonderful! I would give this a gazillion stars!
Delightful Exactly what one would expect  HOWEVER     your child is 7  younger consider readg a chapter ahead to ed selectively  to reposiong the scary parts  Every ltle boy  girl cares very much  about most of these characters  Don't risk givg them nightmares
This book is about some students at a school f wiches  wlocksIt also shows a le  what is real  le  what isn'tLike muggles means humansYou also get to expl  the advenchers of Harry PoterI also thk this one will be better  than the 123 book beacause they get better as  they go
I just fished readg this  i am lerally walkg on air!  Amazg wonderful  spectacular Harry Potter does  aga  this book! I had never been crazy about readg until I read Harry Potter  the Scerer's  Stone  from then on i was hooked!  i had so many high expectations of  this new book   met them all! If you are lookg f a good book f  the summer  f your kids  even f all you adults out there THIS ONE  IS FOR YOU!
Like many fans of the Harry Potter books I waed anxiously f the arrival of the new chapter  the series There is always a concern wh any new book  a series that the auth may have lost some of the magic  Fans of Harry Potter can rest assured that the book does  fact live up to  the hypeFrom the first page the sty grabs you  won't let go  Rowlg starts the sty off at a fast clip  the momentium carries  through to the excg climax Rowlg contues to wre  a style that  will appeal to both adults  childrenThe lessons this book can teach  both children  adults are valuable Once aga Harry learns about  loyalty friendship  facg your fearsI highly reccomend this  series to anyone who still believes that good exists  that  can  triumph over evil
The sheer size of this book amazed me but  spe of the large number of pages there's hardly one that is not imptant to the sty  just pla terestg  When I thought one chapter couldn't be topped I was proved  wrongExcept f some parts (very few!) everythg just  flowed  We  fd out me about old friends  acquatances meet yet *another*  DADA teacher  as ever there are some surprise developments -- not  always happy ones though&quotHarry Potter  the Goblet of  Fire&quot is defely a must-read  The Harry Potter sty has just  gotten much me tense  The young characters are growg up  thgs  are gog to be harder f everyoneNow the wa f Book 5 -- which  seems to promise a reunion of &quotthe old crowd&quot as Dumblede  calls them so  looks like another of my fave characters is  returng!  Yes!
This is the very best book  the series so far!  I picked up the very first copy off the shelf last ne(actually this mng  was 12:01)  as soon as i got  the car i started readg The book was so good i didnt stop readg till 9 o'clock this mng--when i fished   The  book is full of mystery  trigue  And as JK Rowlg promised us  there is a lot of dark stuff happeng rise of great evil  But you cant  have a completely scary book  We also fd out many  secrets of dferent characters secrets of people we hated  people we  felt sry f  I wish i could say me but even the smallest ht would  ru   Rowlg has put  together one of the best books ever  Keeps you on the edge of your seat  through  all Anyways i recommend this book f most anyone a b long   &quotdark&quot f a lot younger kids but even they will love nearly all  of   Buy  i can guarantee you will LOVE 
JK Rowlg has outdone herself once aga  this whopper of a sequel to Harry Potter  the Prisoner of Azkaban! An absolute must read f any Harry fan! If there is anyone left  the Uned States who hasn't  purchased this book do not delayRowlg has created a host of new   terestg characters cludg a new Defense agast the Dark Arts  teacher wh a magical eye  students from all over the wld who come  to Hogwarts to compete  a special tournament! She has stepped up the  danger  the suspense  added a splash of romance along wh the hard  lessons of le To say me would give away this special styI  thought this book was by far the best posively magical
JK Rowlg you did  aga! The book was well wth the money! Just as good as the other three this book was I thouroughly recomend this book to everyone! I can wa until number 5  I'm sure i'll cry when number 7 ends
In this the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series JK Rowlg delivers another wonderfully crafted imagative sty  Although some have cricized Rowlg f an creasg level of &quotdarkness&quot  each new book I feel that children are much better off readg about a  ltle darkness than watchg a 100 murders a day on TV All  all JK Rowlg has delivered aga  I am so happy to  see that a generation is able to share a common lk of lerature
The much-anticipated fourth book  the Harry Potter series has fally been released  As the series goes on the Harry Potter books have become darker  a lot me serious  Harry who has aged 4 years sense the first book has grown up  But this &quotgrowg up&quot may be a b too  fast f most of the series' younger fansWhen the first book came out   was a fairly good-sized book  Now wh 700+ pages  is begng to  look like a series f older kids  The characters &quotfd their  hmones&quot as the auth puts   As the series stretches on kids who have grown  to love the first three books may be surprised at the darkness -  length  of the fourth stallment of the Harry Potter series
Wow! this book really proved that JK rowlg is a wch herself  she mixes  me fantastic adventures i started this mng  have fished now  loved every page This book should not be missed!
The fourth stallement to the Harry Potter series was just recently released today  's wonderful As a 16 year old I'm amazed that I can still enjoy a &quotchildrens&quot book  It's an credibly well wrten  book much meso than even that last three  The characters are  retroduced as old friends which at this pot  the series they are to  many of the readers  My only grievance wh the book is the fact that at  least  some small part the auth is attemptg to live up to her image  as a wrer f both adults  children  The wrg is slightly me   depth descriptive  mature She even uses a swear  the first openg  pages  As a 16 year old child I have no problem wh this    certaly does not impede the magnicent sty  but perhaps a younger  person may have a problem wh that I loved   It's an excellent book   defatly a great contuation of the series  not a b long
I spent the entire day readg   's unbelievably good  As anxious as I was to get   fish  I have to adm that I'm now feverishly wag f the next one to come out  I'm especially happy that this book  will teach younger people to read longer novels  Harry is awesome  you  will not be disappoted  Rowlg is a really good wrer  firm control  of her characters  sty  I thk this series ranks up there wh  Narnia
Each stallment  this series has been better than the last  the fourth is no exception  The same sympathetic characterization  gentle w that have carried the previous episodes are present but combed wh  an creased ption of the mal seriousness  sense of danger that  marked the third volume  The supptg cast is rich  the plot is  astonishgly tricate f any novel let alone &quotchildren's&quot  fiction  Rowlg makes  look efftless  the pieces fall to place  wh a perfect feelg of rightness  This is a serious book wh grave  themes but the lightness of the style the understg of what 's like  to be a kid  the bouncy side plots keep  from feelg like a preachy   weighty tome  The Harry Potter series has been movg towards  creasg matury as Harry grows towards his desty  here  the  fourth volume the true scope of Rowlg's epic ambion f the series has  become clear  Suffice to say 's a doozy  the remag three volumes  have been set up f some pretty excg events  This isn't just good  children's lerature this is lerature that has stantly earned self  classic status  This book is wthy of the hype surroundg 
It is very terestg lot of details Laughs  crys hum  fun I thk this book is fabulos I love  I would reccomend to to children  adults
I've just fished Harry  the Goblet of Fire  under 10 hours JK has aga managed to make me never want to put the book down  the cry as I turn the last page  relise I'll have another year long wa  Harry 4  was not only comicall but serious  sad On some chapters I cryied   others I woke the household wh my laughter  We fd out the effects  journalists can have on a person's le as well as the curelty that can be  subjected from one's own peers  Harry four was truely wth the wa Now  just begs the long wa f the next wonderfully Harry book
I got this book today  I can tell  is gog to be great I already read the first chapters  I fell  love wh the book The book is about Harry Potter gog to Hogwarts f his fourth year This book has 750 pages  is almost as big as a dictionary!  you like Harry Potter BUY THIS  BOOK!
To be honest this is one of the best books I've ever read There is so much happeng at all times that you'll want to read  over  over aga JK Rowlg is a real genius  I can't wa f #5 BUY THIS BOOK NOW!  Even though  is around 750 pages you won't even notice I  fished   a day because the amazg sty kept me gog (I wanted to  turn the car light on at the drive  durg the movie so I could keep  readg!) I even skipped my oath of readg the other 3 aga so I could  read ! I repeat: BUY THIS BOOK NOW!  (! )
Well after readg this book nonstop f the past seven hours I have to say that I was very impressed Rowlg has created a perfect sty  I am now eagerly awag her next wk Parents may be shocked at the endg  but that is no reason to ban the book I am 11 years old  only found   a ltle b scary My commendations go to Ms Rowlg Another wld class  masterpiece
I am a 23-year-old college student who loves these books That said I thouroughly enjoyed the new book I started   I just couldn't stop Younger children may fd  very disturbg  scary Rowlg's  characters are begg to grow up  their lives are becomg filled wh  me concerns than just who gets the best grades The length of the book is  necessary  der f the sty to be set upshe is very obviously  tryg to set the stage f the next 3 books Harry  his friends do not  always have an easy time of jealousy death evil  social  consciousness are all subjects that they have to grow through  this book  The tone of the book is very dark wh many comedic helpgs from Fred   Gege who are startg to thk beyond Hogwarts  to what they want to  do wh their lives  A lot of this book is about that takg stock of the  present  lookg to the future Some might fd  a ltle bg but  I didn't I loved every page  enjoyed the ltle sties that all seemed  to f  wh the return ofah but that would be tellg wouldn't ?  :)
I thk this book is the best  JK's series yet! It's very imagative  whatever you thk is gog to happen-the oppose happens  It's never bg  keeps you on the edge of your seat!
I just got my copy of Harry potter today  i can not put  down This book is f old  young alike It is very rivg
One wd maybe 734 pages wth of Harry Potter is pleasgto the eye  I was engrossed  the plot  sty le of the fourthenstallment of Harry Potter  I currently now so far own the entire Harry Potter collection  I was shocked wh the first chapter  when my premontion of who was gog to be killed was wrong I was shocked because who I found out was the deceased h me hard even thoughwell I cant give everythg away  Dumblede is very serious  this enstallment  I can see why  This shows me that whatever you fear wst s comg but I am glad that there are 3 me books to eagerly awa f  be able to read all 7 books  a dayHarry Potter is an extra-dary kid   I had to give The Goblet of Fire a number between 1-10 I'd give  a 12
JK Rowlg has done  aga (was there ever any doubt?)  Of course I could not put the book down  have fally fished   It was VERY good  VERY funny--there were parts that almost had me  tears I was  laughg so hard  The book had a b me of a dark side than the previous  onesI don't want to ru anythg f those who have not read  yet so  I won't divulge any fmation but  a nutshell  you have any doubts  about buyg the book you shouldn't  If you haven't read any of the Harry  Potter books buy them ALL  fget about the thgs you should be dog   just read  You won't regret !
Another WOW f JK Rowlg!  I thoughly enjoyed  loved this book The end was terribly thrillg  imagative   really sunk s teeth to the sty!
I really have to say that the begng of the book is a b too long The Quiddetch Wld Cup is not as excg as the matches  Hogwarts where many cidents occur F impatient readers wouldn't know the ma pot of  the book-- yet But Harry has grown a ltle he even now has a crush Bill   Charley Weasley is fally showg Hermione  Ron didn't change at  all And you know the Dursleys I would say 's another excellent novel by  JKRowlg but not as good as the other three
harry potter has come a long way from a coffee shop to natonal fame  you thk this happened  a day your mistakenNow the moment we've all been wag f harry potter IV has fally come out  what a h    This bookis so bealiveable that the first time I read one  of the harry potter books  felt so real because  gradully went to the  surrealisum but sse the first part was sobelieveable you thk that   could've happened to you
This is a wonderful book! 's really 45 stars but  doesn't wk like that this book really is the best  the series so far all 700 somethg pages of   took me fever to read but was wth all the way through
This one is very dark  comparison to the other three What makes  dark is the sufferg flected on the weak  the vivid way  is described The book never goes overboard wh this theme  is always kept wh the  bounds of the sty In spe of the hype this book is a must have   you've read the other three This series is the st you can get f  someone who doesn't read often  at all The books are very well wrten   f me the Goblet of Fire is the best so far  that's sayg a lot
I couldn't put  down! This book is a MUST READ f people of all ages! J K Rowlg really knows what she is wrg  has this great way of tellg  to us - makg us feel as  we are  this fantasy as we read !I will defely not spoil the book f you you will jut have to  read  It was wrten so well I couldn't put  down!I can't wa to  see the upcomg movie- Enjoy your readg!
I don't know how JK Rowlg does  This 4th book of the Harry Potter Seris is the best one yet!  You should deffatly read  If there were 6 six star i would have given  that!
I just fished readg Book IV  can scarcely wa to crack the cover aga Just a few of the highlights  ste: Quiddch Wld Cup Triwizard Tournament  a Yule Ball The endg was terryg to me (an  adult) but I believe that  set up plenty of plot les  trigue f  the remag three books My only complat is that I'll have to wa  another whole year f book number 5!
Wasn't that a nice book?  Although Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire did unftunately follow the same general fmat (Dursleys Weasleys Hogwarts angry Malfoy rums of evil competions victy/defeat  Dumblede's explaation the evable Hospal Wg Sceneetc) I  was surprised by how terestg  was to read this book - after fear that  the hype would deaden the impact of fally enjoyg the sty - how fun   was to follow the newest suggestions of who Voldemt's most fahful  Death-Eater could be how sad  was to discover the fates of Neville's  parents  the shock of the death of well nevermd whom  the  hillary of Percy's pomposy  much else besides  Though I appreciate  the growg complexy of these tales I feel saddened to note that  Rowlg's stytellg seems to have lost much of s playful qualy so  like that of Roald Dahl that was que apparent  &quotMr  Mrs  Dursley of Number Four Privet Drive were proud to say they were  perfectly nmal thank you very much&quot  All the same  my  not-so-humble opion Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire was que  deservg of the fame  gly announcg 's arrival  Awag the  debut of HPV at 3:08 pm on Saturday July 8  A Fan
This book was outstg! Lots of surprises   kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through :) I would recommend this book to anyone as  is one of the best I have read  ages! Keep up the good  wk Ms Rowlg! :)
Harry Potter 4 was amazg! JK's best book ever! If I had tochose between 0ne million dollars  the book I'd take the book
After stayg up all night readg the latest stallment i am once aga amazed by Rowlgs wrg  I don't want to blow the pots by sayg who dies  what not so go out  buy !  Oh  don't be timidated by the 700 + pagess a very easy  terestg read
First off do you honestly need a review?  Buy this book!I fished this lasted novel of the le of Harry  company four hours after I received my copy  I stopped f nothg  I believe that this is Rowlg's best book so far she's gotten comftable wh her characters   is showg much deeper sides of themIn Goblet of Fire we learn  many thgs about Potter  the magical wld that many have wondered  about I thk that this book is a b  scary f the younger kids parents may want to read the first chapter by  themselves to make sure that their youngest can hle   I was honestly  scared at certa parts of the novel  me at 19! :)I really don't  want to spoil the wonderful complicated plot so all I have to say is that  you need to buy this book okay?
I just got my delivery of Harry Potter #4 Goblet of Fire a few hours ago  have been readg tently sce  The book is wonderful!  Even the first chapter was captivatg  aside from wrg this message I don't  believe I'll be takg my nose out of the book f the rest of the day!  Thanks f another great addion to the Harry Potter series JK  Rowlg!
The Goblet of Fire  my opion is one of the better sties the Potter series has to offer While nearly twice as long as one of the previous books Rowlg has a gted enough vision to ensure that every page is  justiedOne of the thgs f which I admire Rowlg is her apparent  refusal to allow success to change her style This book could easily have  become a commercialized hack job made f no better purpose than sellg  merchise Instead Rowlg remas vigilant Goblet amuses frightens   even saddens but  never disappots
Whatever I expected of this book I got  am I pleased! This book is still que appropriate f adults to read me so than the earlier ones Although there are some places  the book that Rowlg seems to have given  to public pressure (you can see that she changed the sty here   there) the overall effect is que nice I dont want to spoil any  surprisesgo read   you will love !
The long-awaed HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE won't disappot longtime fans  doesn't offer a lot of surprises eher  Thankfully JK Rowlg plays a ltle wh the by-now-familiar fmula stead of showg Harry's miserable summer wh the Dursleys  launchg right to  the schoolyear (wh the overdone Hogwarts ruals) the auth sends Harry  to a Quiddch tournament wh the Weasleys  I won't reveal any me about  the plot except to mention that He-Who-Won't-Be-Named makes an appearance  (of course)  we get an trigug villa who is troduced  a clever  first chapter  As much fun as the HARRY POTTER books have been I would  like to see Rowlg break away from the confes of her stytellg  fmula  really try f somethg dferent  I've been gettg a  strange case of deja vu over the previous three books as though the fresh  ideas  stytellg ventions of the first tale have been recycled wh  only m variations
 my opion the best potter book avalible the 4th book sure lives up to s name! Four times the action four times the excment four times the hum a must have f all potter fans even muggels should pick up this must have
This is the fest Harry Potter book yet In  we see Harry evolve  grow both as a wizard  as a human beg I couldn't book the book down I read   one long long stg wh cles l beside me  magic   the room This book is f people of all ages It will teach you how to  face the challenges of your own le  how to trust  your own gts  Thank-you JK Rowlg You did  aga!Also reccomended PSYCHIC  LIVING BY Andrei Ridgeway This book is also an enchantg masterpiece
i ran out to get this book  I started readg   the middle of the night  is MAGNIFASANT!  I am already eagar to get the 5th book out of the 7 books!
Fantastic  Yet another page turner by Rowlg  Excellent f all ages  The most fun 700+ page book I've ever read  Although I started wh Book I  read them  der Rowlg has an amazg abily to give you all the  background fmation that you need  each book whout makg   repetious Truly an spirational sty le f younger audiences who  are wried about all the thgs we wry about when we are young  And the  sty has the abily to carry us away no matter our age  Lookg f a  series of books to hook a 4th-6th grader on readg?  You've found   Also wonderful books to read to/wh younger children  Older kids will  probably like  too but they may never adm   -)
As avid fans of the first three Harry Potter books  would seem tobe that we would be the last people to cricize the fourth one  WhenRowlg said that her books would become darker we did not suspect that they would become extremely so  We do not recommend this book f the young (11  under) people that this series has captivated so far  There was an creased amount of violence  occaisional crude remarks  suations that we felt could have easily been omted from the sty There was not much comic relief eher  We don't plan on purchasg the fth book unless Rowlg lightens up the plot  considers the audience to which her tales appeal
Incredible s the simpliest wd I can give f this br new wk  the le of Harry Potter books Just as surprisg  imagative as the first three books the series contues to get better  me revealg about Harry Potter  his friends  family All I can say is that this  book should be read by everyone young  old as well as the other three  Read on!
I was a b wried at first that Book 4 wouldn't live up to my expectations but after stayg up all night on July 8th  readg the whole thg ( 10  so hours) I realized that this was the best book yet  I was disapoted by a few aspects I'm afraid like the ter-house  Quiddch tournaments not gog on but there were plenty of other  entertag apects to keep you terested I won't go to those now  however as they might ru some of the surprises f everyoneThere is  a wealth of new characters  this book wh many terestg  engagg  people we meet along our journey through the vast 700-odd pages My  fave of the new ones was probably Mad Eye the new Defence agast the  Dark arts teacherIn this book we also learn me about the fe  Magic schools  even meet some of the students Also we go to the  Quiddch Wld Cup which is full of excement  (as usual f Harry)  danger!The book was que fufillg  I plan to read  a few me  times to pick me up on the big picture The endg left a lot open f  the future although left off at 's usual spotLooks like 's time to  start campg  front of the bookstes f book V
well what can i say?  she's done  aga!  after around a year sc eharry potter 3 came out jk rowlg is fally back wh the next book  the series  harry potter 4: harry potter  the goblet of fire  Judgg by all the publicy 's not a small thg  The book self is  wonderful filled wh twists  turns that will leave you wonderg   tryg to put together the pieces till the last mute  You meet new  people new animals new suations etc   is just another great piece of  wk  all 700+ pages will keep you stuck readg from the first till the  last  thee is no bg moment  i myself read the book  6 hours  whout stop   was GREAT!
This was a great  exg book  When I read  I can't put  down  It is a great book!  I defly recommend  even f adults  My dad even reads them
This is a wonderful book Although there were slight dissapotments such as there beg no quiddch matches the terrg endg made up f  all Ms Rowlg ends of a b of a clf hanger  now im despre to  read book 5 (another YEAR! I dont know what I'll do) I highly suggest  this book but not f younger childeren
It's Saturday mng  oddly quiet on our ty block  This is the day my daughter  all her girlfriends have been awag  A pack of them left squealg not long ago  They'd come to compare their copiessome  arrived at the do from Amazonsome at the midnight party  the local  bookstesome at the mall wh parents still yawng They've excedly  discussed how many pageshow many chapterswhat will become of this  character  that  Now all have gone  are curled up  their homes  silently gulpg their treatsI could not be happier that my girl   her friends can get so wked up about a book  A BOOKThank you  JK Rowlg
 my opion the best potter book avalible the 4th book sure lives up to s name! Four times the action four times the excment four times the hum a must have f all potter fans even muggels should pick up this  must have
I am right  the middle of  now about 200 pages to  It looks very very good The first chapter is que creepy  you know somethg is gog on somethg big but you don't know exactly what! I am gog  back to fish the book nowI wonder what the Goblet of Fire has to do  wh anythg  hasn't even been mentioned!
I really enjoyed ! It's just what we have been wag f! Action-packed adventureous  sense of fear A real page turner! I highly recommend this book! =)
This book is wonderfulIt's perfect f all agesIF your kids don't like to read buy them this bookthey just might enjoy readg after they read thisthe sty is funnyexcg addictivealthough befe you read  this book read the otheronesthe only flaw wh this book is the fact that   seems rushed altlebut all  all 's great book
Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is wrten by authour JK Rowlg who has wrten all of the other books  the Harry Potter Series I love Miss Rowlg's wk  Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire is a perfect example of how well she wres Wh termanology like &quotQuiddch&quot  &quotMuggles&quot 's amazg how she creates a perfect imagry  description of the characters This book has a wonderful plot When Harry's name get's pulled out of the Goblet of Fire (A device that basicly is a holdg pen f thgs such as nametags as used  the book) he gets overwhelmgly suspicious because he did not put his name  the goblet to compete  the Triwizard ournament the event that was gog to be held at Hogwarts Harry's school Harry must compete  dferent events such as a huge maze that is full of magical obstacles to divg to a frigid pond to rescue a person All  all I would highly recommend this book to anybody
At 734 pages just holdg up &quotThe Goblet of Fire&quot was a task But all wth  It starts out once aga wh Harry  his hrible muggle relatives you're quickly drawn  by the first sentence which  discusses the &quotRiddle House&quot The length does become an issue   several chapters to the book but the wrg style makes the long les  of text bearable Much of  can be attributed to full-length poems prted   the book Quiddch a violently trigug flyg game moves the sty  along Harry  his friends attend a Quiddch Wld Cup that takes on the  persona of a European soccer match The event leaves Harry  Co psyched  f their own mi-Wld Cup the Tri-Wizard tournament This section is  particularly terestg as we fd that other wizardg schools exist But   isn't all fun  games Rowlg allowed readers to know befeh that  someone would die  this stallment sadly we will no longer enjoy the  company ofof course not Me of the same comes  the fm of another  new teacher new wizardg gizmos  me of Harry's irresistible charm --  which ws over a certa young lady  shoves him to the datg scene  The sty is me adult than child but the wdg manages to barely gloss  over some hribly frighteng moments It's me of the same  then  's some me
Wh all the hype surroundg this book substance could bemeager  still be acceptable However this book is by far the bestof all It's a ltle older a ltle me sophisticated than the others but  wks wonderfully The basis of the book is that the Triwizard tournament which hasn't been held f one hundred years  now beg held at Hogwarts  Tradionally three champions are picked from the three competg schools from a &quotgoblet of fire&quot Harry does not even enter but the goblet sputters up his name Thus the book truly begas The champions undergo three &quottasks&quot such as gettg past dragons rescug captives from merpeople  fdg their way out of an enchanted maze I don't want to reveal too much but I will say this: Snape had a fmer lea twist I found very terestg All  all these books just keep gettg better
The first three books  the Harry Potter series were awesome I was obsessed wh them so much that I went onle almost every day  talked about them Stone  Azkaban were my faves  chamber was OK I  counted the days till the fourth book came out  what did I fd? A book  wse than two It lacks the action  mysteries found  books 1  2  It looks me like an adult book than a kid's book to me Not to mention  's longer than a lot of adult biographies! Accdg to a recent  terview JK said that two  four were her faves so we can expect  me books like Goblet of Fire!
I just fished readg 'Fire It is a spectacular wonder It sets the stage f HP 5 Its a must buy  read The characters are show -depth (Note: I do not thk anyone under 10 should read this book) READ IT!
Unless you've been livg under a rock f the last two years you've heard all about the explos of one Harry Potter  his merry cadre of magic-makers  spell-casters  He's made the cover of Time  he's  captured the heart of readers everywhere-  f once as &quotRollg  Stone&quot said about A Confederacy of Dunces everyone is right  JK  Rowlg's got a knack f efftlessly clean wrg that is enviable  In  this the latest the scenario doesn't skew  the least- Harry gets  himself to a load of dficulties  traumas often advertently  sometimes wh the help of his ultimate nemesis Voldemt  Rowlg sends  the reader to a labyrth of twists  turns- this is easily the most  sprawlg of the four thus far released at a hefty 752 pages-  one  emerges after another breathtakg endg sequence wh a far better  ptra of exactly who Harry Potter is  To reveal any me would be to  reveal too much  Suffice  to say- 's wth the hype  And then some
I was fully expectg to be let down by this book because of all the hype but I wasn't It was suspenseful  dramatic but  also had heart I also love how Rowlg contues to make the details count - there are  ltle details from the first three books that I didn't even thk about  that became signigant Wd of advice though - make sure that you have  read the first three books befe startg this one If you don't you  won't underst as much as you should about the plot The book draws very  heavily on the second  third books I'm not gog to say anyme  because 's very imptant not to give details sce the suprises are  what makes the book special However suffice  to say that I am very  very pleased  I am not lookg fward to wag another year f the  next book!
This book is SO cool I love the way JK Rowlg wres I couldnt put  down when I first got  My mom had to unglue my face from the pages!
The new Harry Potter took me 5 hours to read - but  was wth  Startg out wh a dark mysterious atmosphere not known to the HP books befe the book made the reader &quotknow&quot that somethg big was gog to happen  the book Harry Potter our hero  his fourth year  experiences me than ever  this thrillg 752 page novel  :-) J/K A new book to contue the legend of HP - I wonder what's next   ste f us
I absolutely loved the book  was a real page turner If you like your sleep I suggest you not read this book because  will keep you up all night  It was a wonderfully wrten book full of suspence  mystery that kept me on the edge of my  seat My sugestion to you is that you go out  buy a copy  then read    then read  agian It's a truly fabulous book that no one should  pass up
In all the hype gog on befe this latest book's release I thk I lost sight of the basics of J K Rowlg's wrg - skills: humour the charm of the unexpected  blisterg w - all of  targeted 100% accurately  at her readershipHer uncanny knack f pickg up a style   veerg off  a totally unfeseen direction is as practised  her  wrg as adept as everYou'd thk that Harry  his friends might  deserve a b of a rest from Voldemt - but they pick up their adventures  where they leave off In the chillg troducty chapter  becomes  obvious that Voldemt's gettg me evil  me threateng wh every  book -  Harry has to get stronger to deal wh himHe's not left  alone to do so though - amid the excement of the Quiddch Wld Cup   the followg term at Hogwarts he's bombarded wh new people new  experiences  above all new monsters to deal whWh her usual  light touch J K Rowlg takes Harry through one of the toughest of his  adventures - endg wh a competion that leads him straight to  conflict wh his deadliest enemyHow he survives  wh his friends'  help  how he comes to terms wh a death along the way is movg  excg  often very funnyThis is probably the most complex of the  Harry Potter books wh a plot that's me serpente than ever (but just  as logical) It carries you along wh  as fast as befe  I found   hard to put down until I'd fished I'd say  was the best yet  a  series that's one of the best I've read A defe 5 stars!
This book is an adventurus book that has loads of susspence  action It is very long so you won't read   to fast That means that the fun will last twice as long I recomend this book to anyone who likes adventure   susspence This is my fave book  the series
I am a 12 year old boy from Atlanta  I just bought this book fished   about a day  a half I was up all night  ijust fished  AAAWWWEEESSSOOOMMMEEE!  I didnt expect most of the thgs that happen  the book I recomend that you get this book as fast as you can  read  to discover how great a wrer JK Rowlg really is
JK Rowlg has once aga lived up to her expecatations!  This is by far one of the best Harry Potter books yet! It is highly recommended!
This book is great! It is a lot longer than the other books wh 734 pages  thirty-seven chapters It is filled wh new excements  dangers wh Voldemt tryg aga to kill Harry Potter Buy this book  you  will see what you have been wag so long f Just make sure you buy   on Amazoncom
I have not been able to put  down sce  arrived at my house about seven hours ago  It was so dferent from all her other books which made  trestg  Still the endg totally leaves you hangg  i cannot  wa f the next book
Who can resist a Harry Potter tale?J K Rowlg has proven aga that her ternational success seemed evable -- from the first page of Harry Potter  the Goblet of Fire the sty soarsIt is beautully  wrten wh a strong narrative  fascatg unfgettable characters   there is not a reader  the wld who won't love this bookThe  novel is long - me than 700 pages --  not one wd is wastedNow  my only problem is I need to fd Harry so I can start classes at Hogwarts  soon I sent him a message by owl just this mng
This book was up to every expectation  I am 54 year old student  elementary edcation  Am  Children's Lerature class  we read Vol 2 Pleasure  readg Volume 4 equal to that of my first read of Gone wh the Wd when I was 14  Excellent plot development somethg f  everyone  believable dilemmas f all of the young people Not too long   a real page turner 
I was one of those people campg out  the bookste on friday night  I stayed up all night readg the longest book yet  Although  is 700+ pages at no pot does  drag on  The whole time i was very volved  wh the book  as i am sure you have already heard somebody imptant does  die which makes the book very suspencful I enjoyed this book me than  probably any of the others  It deserves all of the hype  is gettg!
This is by far the best Harry Potter book yet a must f fans of the previous books I will not delve too deeply to the plot as I could not tell you one thg whout givg too much detail  rug the sty  but you will thouroughly enjoy this book!
This is possibly the best book I have read This is the best of JK Rowlg I hope her next three are just as good

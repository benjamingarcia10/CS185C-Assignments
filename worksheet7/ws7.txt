The best Harry Potter so far.  People actually die and Voldemort is a real threat now!
In reviewing the previous three Harry Potter books, I neglected to mention that Harry never really got around to liking anybody.  He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100,000/100
This is the fourth book in the series, and the movie version will be coming out soon. I just finished reading this book for the second or third time since it first debuted, and the story holds up just as strongly, if not even stronger, this time. I think the intricacy of the plot gets lost on us fans and readers sometimes, but Rowling has superbly crafted the plot and deftly reveals the story of Harry Potter in such a way that leaves us both satisfied and yet eagerly clamouring for more. I cannot wait to finally read the \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" and then the long-awaited final book in the series. Ms. Rowling has left her indelible imprint on both the literary field and our culture as a whole, and as both an adoring fan and an envious fellow writer, I'm very glad I've in some small way been able to share in this magical tale.<br /><br />If you still haven't entered into this world, you should introduce yourself to Harry Potter now.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks[...]
The plot continues to be interesting in the latest installment of the Harry Potter series, and the characters begin to evolve and face more complex situations.
This is a great book in the Harry Potter series. Like most HP fans, after reading this book, I immediately read the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more insights and information on all the books in the series and the upcoming new GOF Movie 4. Highly recommend

The best Harry Potter so far.  People actually die and Voldemort is a real threat now!
In reviewing the previous three Harry Potter books, I neglected to mention that Harry never really got around to liking anybody.  He was way too busy with his schooling and Quidditch to do much of anything.  Fortunately for us, this changes in The Goblet of Fire.. but I'm getting ahead of myself. <br />Starting from the beginning, Harry once again finds himself at the Dursleys... and whisked back to Hogwarts by Mr. Weasley, but not before George sabotages Dudley with his newly invented Ton-Tongue Toffee.  When Harry arrives at Hogwarts, he is shocked to hear that the Interhouse Quidditch Championship won't be held because Hogwarts, along with preppy Beauxbatons and cold, indifferent Durmstrang, will be participating in the ultimate wizarding trial: the recently-brought-back Triwizard Tournament. Each school will have one representative.  From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen; from Durmstrang, Viktor Krum; and from Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory... One problem: the Goblet of Fire enters another Hogwarts student into the Triwizard Tournament.  Who?  Duh.. Harry.   <br />Throughout the three trials of the Tournament, Harry learns to rely on his friends more than ever.  He also is in for the shock of his life when he and Cedric are transported to an open field, where they witness a horrible deed: Lord Voldemort (aka He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named or You-Know-Who) has risen and is back in his body.  Voldemort then kills Cedric (who is dating Cho Chang, a Ravenclaw Quidditch player and secret love of Harry [yes, he finally likes someone]) and duels Harry.  Who wins?  Duh.. Harry- but barely.  The rest is just anticlimactic and thus not worthy of mentioning here. <br />Overall rating: much better than Prisoner of Azkaban and one of Rowling's best.  100,000/100
This is the fourth book in the series, and the movie version will be coming out soon. I just finished reading this book for the second or third time since it first debuted, and the story holds up just as strongly, if not even stronger, this time. I think the intricacy of the plot gets lost on us fans and readers sometimes, but Rowling has superbly crafted the plot and deftly reveals the story of Harry Potter in such a way that leaves us both satisfied and yet eagerly clamouring for more. I cannot wait to finally read the \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" and then the long-awaited final book in the series. Ms. Rowling has left her indelible imprint on both the literary field and our culture as a whole, and as both an adoring fan and an envious fellow writer, I'm very glad I've in some small way been able to share in this magical tale.<br /><br />If you still haven't entered into this world, you should introduce yourself to Harry Potter now.<br /><br />- Gregory Bernard Banks[...]
The plot continues to be interesting in the latest installment of the Harry Potter series, and the characters begin to evolve and face more complex situations.
This is a great book in the Harry Potter series. Like most HP fans, after reading this book, I immediately read the new ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence to gain even more insights and information on all the books in the series and the upcoming new GOF Movie 4. Highly recommend
